{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first thing that stands out is the repeated use of `powershell.exe` with multiple entries showing 'Process accessed' and some registry changes. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that there are several instances where it's accessing processes and modifying the registry could be concerning.\n\nNext, I notice commands like `whoami.exe` which usually just return user information, so that by itself isn't too suspicious unless used in conjunction with other activities. Then there's a command line involving `cmd.exe` creating a service named `win32times` using `sc create`. This is interesting because creating services can be a way to persistence, especially if it's done through an unusual script path like `c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1`. Since the script name doesn't exist, this might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or create a backdoor.\n\nThere are multiple entries where various processes like `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe` are making registry changes. These are system processes, but if they're being used inappropriately, it could be a sign of tampering. For example, modifying the registry can allow attackers to change system configurations or add malicious entries.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of `sc.exe` to create and query services, especially with command lines that execute scripts. This technique is often seen in malware for persistence or privilege escalation. The repeated attempts might be an attacker trying different methods to establish a foothold.\n\nI also see events involving `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and even `notepad.exe`. While these are standard utilities, their use alongside other suspicious activities could mean they're being exploited as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere's one event where `calc.exe` loads the `urlmon.dll` file. This is unusual because Calculator typically doesn't need to load such DLLs, which are more associated with URL handling and might be used by malware for network communications or other malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the sequence of events, it seems like there's a pattern of process creation, registry modifications, and attempts to execute scripts. This behavior is consistent with an attacker trying to establish persistence, drop files, or communicate with command-and-control servers.\n\nAlso, some processes like `winlogbeat.exe` are creating files, which might be part of legitimate log shipping, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is related to malicious activities. However, combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe overall combination of multiple process creations, registry modifications, and attempts to execute non-existent scripts suggests a potential attack. The high number of suspicious processes accessing sensitive areas like the registry makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations, registry modifications, and attempts to execute non-existent scripts, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to spot any patterns or unusual activities. \n\nThe first few lines involve processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe being created or accessed. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting and can execute commands, which might be malicious. But here, it seems to be just starting up normally.\n\nThen there are multiple events where svchost.exe is involved in registry value sets. Svchost is part of Windows services, so that's normal unless it's being manipulated by malware.\n\nLooking further, I see a lot of RegistryEvent tasks from various processes like chrome.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. These could be legitimate operations as applications often interact with the registry for configuration settings. However, repeated writes to the registry might be suspicious if they come from unexpected sources.\n\nAnother point is that some processes are loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll or amsi.dll. While these are standard, malicious code sometimes loads them to hide their activities or inject into other processes.\n\nI also notice an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and shouldn't be inherently suspicious, but if it's behaving oddly, like accessing unexpected files, that could be concerning.\n\nThere are some ImageLoad events for various exe files loading DLLs, which can be normal but might indicate malicious activity if the DLLs aren't expected.\n\nI don't see any direct evidence of exploits or data breaches in these logs. Most of the activities seem to align with typical user behavior and application operations. There's a lot of registry interaction, which is common for applications, especially during startup or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, the high number of RegistryEvent tasks from different processes could be a sign of script execution or installation of software that might have malicious intent. Similarly, multiple powershell.exe instances accessing resources might warrant closer monitoring to ensure they're not being used for unauthorized activities.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some red flags like unusual process interactions and repeated registry accesses, without more context or evidence of direct malicious behavior, it's hard to say this batch is definitively suspicious. It might still be worth keeping an eye on these processes and correlating with other logs for a clearer picture.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events does not present clear evidence of malicious activity but contains some elements that merit closer monitoring. Key points include:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activity**: The presence of multiple powershell.exe instances accessing resources suggests potential script execution, which could be legitimate or suspicious.\n\n2. **Registry Interaction**: Numerous RegistryEvent tasks from various processes, including chrome.exe and svchost.exe, indicate possible configuration changes. While normal, excessive registry writes can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**: Processes loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might be attempting to hide or inject code, though this is not conclusive without further context.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity**: The creation of files by winlogbeat.exe should be monitored to ensure it's part of normal log management activities.\n\n5. **ImageLoad Events**: These events are common but could indicate malicious behavior if the DLLs involved are unexpected.\n\n**Conclusion**: While there are potential red flags, such as unusual process interactions and registry accesses, these logs don't definitively point to malicious activity. Further investigation, including correlating with other logs and monitoring these processes over time, is recommended to assess risk accurately."}
