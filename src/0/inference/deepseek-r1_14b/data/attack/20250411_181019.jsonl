{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That makes sense because it's probably the log collection tool itself writing some data or configuration files. Nothing unusual there.\n\nNext, I see ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and multiple instances of powershell.exe all setting registry values. These are common system processes that do legitimate tasks like configuration changes, so those events alone don't raise any red flags.\n\nThen there's a lot of chrome.exe entries. They're setting registry values repeatedly. Chrome is known to make many such calls during operation, especially for settings and extensions, so this isn't concerning by itself.\n\nHowever, I notice that one of the chrome.exe processes loaded amsi.dll, which is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface. That's interesting because sometimes attackers might try to disable or bypass AMSI. But in this case, it's just loading the normal system file, so maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nAnother event shows chrome.exe accessing MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. This could be part of normal operations as well, perhaps during a scan or update.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are multiple registry writes and DLL loads, none seem out of the ordinary for legitimate processes. There's no indication of malicious activity like unusual file accesses, process creation from unknown sources, or known bad file hashes. The high number of chrome.exe events might just be it running as expected, perhaps with many extensions or active tabs.\n\nSo overall, I don't see any patterns that would suggest malicious behavior in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe, registry modifications by legitimate processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe, and multiple registry accesses by chrome.exe. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies in these logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me look through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations and accesses, especially powershell.exe being used multiple times. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities, but it's also a legitimate tool. The command lines are sometimes obfuscated with things like \"cmd \/c start\" pointing to .ps1 files that don't exist. That seems suspicious because non-existing scripts might indicate an attempt to hide the actual payload or avoid detection.\n\nThere are several events where cmd.exe is used to create services using sc.exe, which creates a service named win32times with a binPath that starts another command. This could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms for malware, allowing it to run at startup without being easily noticeable.\n\nThe use of Registry value sets across various processes like services.exe and svchost.exe stands out too. Malware often modifies the Windows registry to maintain persistence or configuration. The repeated attempts might be trying to ensure that their changes stick even if some operations fail.\n\nNotably, calc.exe is mentioned loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL used for URL handling. However, in combination with other suspicious activities, it's worth monitoring because sometimes malware can inject malicious code into legitimate processes like calc.exe.\n\nThere are also events where notepad.exe and conhost.exe interact with the registry, which could be part of script execution or to hide malicious activity within common system tools.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some normal events like RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry and Calculator.exe loading a DLL. These might just be regular system operations, but given the overall pattern, they add to the context without necessarily indicating malicious intent on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe with obfuscated commands, creating services that don't seem legitimate, and multiple registry modifications are red flags. While each event might not be alarming individually, the combination suggests potential malicious activity aimed at persistence and hiding.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe usage, cmd.exe commands with obfuscated paths, service creation attempts, and repeated registry modifications. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
