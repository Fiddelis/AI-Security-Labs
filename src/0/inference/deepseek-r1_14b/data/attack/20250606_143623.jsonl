Processes like svchost.exe and services.exe are modifying the registry with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted'. These could be normal system operations sincesvchost is a common Windows process used by various services.\n\nThen there's setup.exe making changes, including creating files in Program Files for Edge-related executables. It also created shortcuts in user profiles and the Start Menu. Setup.exe typically handles installations or configurations, so these actions might be part of a legitimate software update or installation.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the frequency is normal. There are multiple entries from setup.exe creating different files and registry changes. If this happened during an actual setup process, it's expected. But if it's happening outside of an install context, it could be suspicious. Since there's no indication of unusual paths or repeated attempts that might suggest persistence mechanisms, the events seem within normal bounds.\n\nAnother point is the variety of tasks: creating files and registry entries, along with pipe creation. Setup.exe doing these during Edge-related activities doesn't raise red flags on their own.\n\nI'm not seeing any anomalies like access to unexpected locations, failed operations, or unusual timestamps that might indicate malicious activity. The combination of events appears consistent with software installation or configuration processes.\n\nSo, while each individual event could be normal, the entire batch doesn't collectively point to anything suspicious.

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events. There's a process named 'services.exe' setting registry values multiple times. Then there's another process called 'tarefa_logico.exe' which is loading several files related to .NET Framework components like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. This seems normal for an application that might be using some .NET libraries.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but sometimes it's just legitimate use. However, creating files in non-standard locations could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of services.exe setting registry values repeatedly. This repetition might indicate some automated process or possibly something more nefarious like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe last few events involve processes like MsMpEng.exe and svchost.exe also modifying the registry. Svchost.exe is commonly used by legitimate Windows services, but it can also be exploited by malware. The repeated registry writes from various processes could be part of a larger campaign to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting this together, while individual events might look normal, the combination—especially the repetitive registry modifications across different processes and the involvement of svchost.exe and powershell.exe—is raising flags. These could indicate potential malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes, including svchost.exe and services.exe, showing repetitive registry modifications, which may indicate suspicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. I'm going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where the process is 'svchost.exe' and the task is a Registry value set. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. Registry changes aren't inherently malicious, but repeated writes could be suspicious. However, without more context on what's being changed, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen there are events from 'setup.exe' creating several files in the EdgeCore and Edge directories. Setup.exe is commonly associated with software installations. The paths mentioned look like standard locations for Microsoft Edge components. These file creations could be part of a normal update or installation process, so that doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nThere's also an event from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' modifying the registry. Runtime Broker is another legitimate Windows component, often involved in app container management. Registry modifications here are likely normal unless there's something unusual about what's being changed.\n\nAnother point is that all these events seem to be isolated actions without any关联 across different processes or events. There's no indication of multiple suspicious activities happening around the same time that might suggest a coordinated attack.\n\nConsidering the timestamps aren't provided, I can't assess if these events happened in quick succession, which could indicate malicious behavior. Without that context, it's safer to assume routine operations unless there are clear signs of compromise.\n\nIn summary, while some activities like repeated Registry writes could warrant closer inspection, the lack of additional indicators and the nature of the processes involved suggest this batch doesn't present a significant security risk.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate system processes such as registry modifications by svchost.exe and file creations by setup.exe related to Microsoft Edge installation, which are typical during software updates or installations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see that most are related to PowerShell.exe and services.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is being accessed, creating processes, loading images, and even some file operations like creation and deletion. Also, there's a lot of registry activity from both PowerShell and services.exe.\n\nHmm, why would someone use PowerShell so many times? I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command line in one of the events shows something about creating a service with a specific name and binary path. That seems suspicious because it's using a PowerShell command to create a new service, which could be part of installing malware.\n\nAlso, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted by PowerShell. Temporary files are often used in malicious scripts to avoid detection, so this might indicate that something was run from the script and then cleaned up quickly.\n\nThe services.exe process is also modifying the registry multiple times. Services can be legitimate, but if they're adding or changing service entries without proper authorization, it could be an attempt to install a persistent backdoor or malware component.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'New-Service' in PowerShell. That's not a built-in cmdlet, so maybe it's part of a script meant to create malicious services on the system. If that's the case, it could indicate an attempt to gain persistence across reboots, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nI'm also noticing several ImageLoad events from PowerShell. While loading DLLs isn't inherently bad, if they're loading unexpected or external libraries, that might be part of malicious activity. But in this case, the paths seem normal, like system32 and .NET framework files, so maybe not too suspicious there.\n\nThe file creation and deletion under Temp directory could be trying to execute code from a script without leaving evidence, which is another red flag. Temporary scripts are often used to avoid detection by antivirus software.\n\nOverall, while some events aren't necessarily bad on their own, the combination of multiple PowerShell instances creating services, writing to the registry, and handling temporary files suggests possible malicious behavior. The repetitive use of 'ProcessCreate' for PowerShell might also indicate automated or script-based activity trying to hide its tracks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch seems to show signs that could be indicative of an attack or unauthorized system changes. Therefore, I would classify this as interesting and require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances with suspicious activities including creating services, registry modifications, temporary file operations, and image loading events suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries where setup.exe is making changes to the registry. Specifically, there are multiple instances where 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' tasks are logged. While setup.exe typically handles system configuration during installations, repeated registry writes could be suspicious, especially if they're not part of an ongoing process.\n\nNext, there are several Pipe Created events from setup.exe. pipes are often used for inter-process communication. The frequency here might indicate some form of command and control or lateral movement within the system, which is a red flag in security contexts.\n\nThen, looking at svchost.exe creating multiple files in the Windows Temp directory. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process but it's commonly targeted by malware to hide malicious activities. The filenames look like temporary appx package files, which could be normal during updates or installations. However, the number of these files and their paths (some are 'AppReadiness') might indicate some unusual behavior, possibly related to persistence mechanisms or dropping malicious payloads.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple registry edits by setup.exe, pipe creations for potentially communicating, and svchost creating temp files that don't seem immediately legitimate. These activities collectively could be signs of malicious behavior, especially if they occur in a short timeframe without corresponding user activity or known software installations.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these actions are normal during system updates or software installations. But the sheer volume and combination make me lean towards them being indicative of something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications and file creations by setup.exe and svchost.exe, which could indicate malicious activity such as persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a series of JSONL events and asked to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Most of them involve powershell.exe performing various actions like loading images, creating files, accessing processes, and using pipes. These are common activities in PowerShell scripts, especially during legitimate operations or script executions.\n\nOne notable event is the process create task for whoami.exe. This is a standard system command used to determine user information, which itself isn't malicious but could be part of a script's setup phase.\n\nHowever, looking closer at the powershell.exe events, there are file creations in temporary directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_*. These files might be related to PowerShell's execution policies or script testing. Such activities can sometimes indicate script execution attempts, which could be malicious if the scripts contain harmful commands.\n\nThe command line for one of the powershell.exe processes is quite telling: it's executing a script with an If-Command that checks for specific .inf files and exits based on their content. This behavior might be probing for sensitive information or system configurations, which raises suspicion as attackers often use such techniques to gather data or establish persistence.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of file creation in temp directories, loading various DLLs (some from Windows Defender), and executing a script that checks system files could indicate malicious activity. While individual events aren't alarming, their cumulative nature suggests potential foul play. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further to ensure there's no underlying threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activities including file creation in temporary directories and loading various DLLs, along with a suspicious script execution that checks for specific system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events. My goal is to determine if the entire set is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries are coming from `svchost.exe`. This is a known process that can be legitimate but is often used by malware because it's a generic name and runs as part of services. The logs show file creation events and registry value sets. Specifically, the files created are in `C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness` with long SIDs (Security Identifiers). These SIDs typically indicate Windows system-related activities, so seeing them might be normal during certain operations. However, repeated writes to these specific paths by svchost could warrant closer investigation.\n\nNext, there's an entry from `RuntimeBroker.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process handling runtime brokerage services. It’s performing a registry write, which isn't unusual and might not raise red flags on its own.\n\nThen comes the `powershell.exe` activity. The command line shows it was executed with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`. Restricted execution policies are supposed to prevent script execution, but in this case, the command is simple and doesn't execute scripts, so that's less concerning. However, powershell is a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. The subsequent image load events show it loading standard .NET libraries and PowerShell-related DLLs, which align with normal operation.\n\nPutting it all together: While each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the sheer number of repeated file creation events from svchost.exe and the powershell activity could indicate potential malicious behavior. However, considering that these actions could also occur during legitimate system operations or updates, the confidence level isn't too high for definitive classification as malicious.\n\nTherefore, I'd classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to the combination of multiple unusual activities, but with a moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation and registry write events by svchost.exe, along with PowerShell activity, could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}

Each event has a process, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe loading something related to Windows Defender. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. But then the second event is cmd.exe running a command that disables Windows Defender features and removes them without restarting. Disabling antivirus sounds like an attempt to lower system security, which is a red flag.\n\nThe third event again shows powershell.exe accessing something, but no file info. Then there's a series of Dism.exe processes creating files in a temporary folder. I remember that Dism is usually for image management, but seeing it create multiple DLLs and exe files seems unusual. Especially when the paths are all in a temp directory with specific filenames.\n\nThe repeated use of Dism.exe accessing executable files makes me think there's something malicious being unpacked or executed. The files created include .dll and .exe, which could be part of a payload. Also, the temporary folder path is consistent across events, suggesting some script is running to extract these files.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe is disabling Defender, powershell is involved, and Dism is creating multiple executables in temp. This combination looks like an attempt to remove antivirus protection and drop malicious files. So, this batch should be classified as interesting because it indicates potential tampering with system security and possible malware deployment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show disabling of Windows Defender using cmd.exe and Dism.exe creating multiple files in a temporary directory, suggesting potential malicious activity to remove antivirus protection and deploy executables.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The filenames like *.dll.mui suggest they're part of language packs or system resources. Since Dism.exe is a known system process, these activities might be part of standard system operations.\n\nNo signs of unusual behavior, multiple failed attempts, or irregular timestamps are present.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL entries, each line has a \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" object. The process is consistently named \"Dism.exe\". I know that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services, used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's a legitimate system process, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThe winlog field in each event mentions \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". This suggests that the system detected an executable file being accessed or created. The path in the file object is pointing to various .dll.mui files in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. The paths are like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[GUID]\\en-US\\[filename].mui'.\n\nI'm trying to figure out why Dism.exe would be accessing these specific files. The filenames include things like \"DismCore.dll.mui\", \"DismProv.dll.mui\", and others. These seem to be resource files, possibly language packs or localized strings used by the DISM tool. Since DISM is a legitimate Windows component, it's normal for it to access its own resources during operation.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are happening in quick succession, it could just be part of a normal system process. However, I should check if multiple file accesses from Dism.exe accessing several files at once is typical behavior. It might be part of an update or deployment process where DISM is extracting or loading multiple resource files.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the path structure. The temporary directory with a GUID suggests it's a per-session or per-operation temporary folder, which makes sense for DISM when processing images or updates. So the creation and access of these files in such a location isn't inherently suspicious.\n\nI also need to think about whether there are any known malicious activities associated with Dism.exe. From what I know, it's not commonly targeted by malware, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. However, given the context here—accessing resource files during what appears to be normal operation—it's less likely to be malicious.\n\nLooking at the timestamps of these events (though they aren't provided), if they occurred over a short period without any other unusual activities, it might not indicate anything suspicious. If there were other signs like access from an unknown user or non-standard locations, that would raise more concern, but that's not present here.\n\nIn summary, while the repeated detection of file executables could seem concerning at first glance, the context provided by the process and file paths suggests this is part of normal Windows operations.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are JSON objects with three keys: process, winlog, and file. Each line represents a different event, except for the last few which seem related but involve a different process name.\n\nLooking at the first 12 events, they all have \"DismHost.exe\" as the process. The winlog task is consistently \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\", and each has a file path pointing to various .dll files in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific GUID-like folder name. These files include IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, DmiProvider.dll, etc.\n\nThe 13th event changes the process to \"Dism.exe\", and the winlog task is now \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". The file paths here are for two .dll files from the same temporary directory as before. So it seems like DismHost.exe was loading these DLLs, and then Dism.exe is deleting them.\n\nI recall that DISM (Deployment Image Service and Management) is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating system images. It's commonly used during setup or updates to manage packages. The temporary directory structure looks typical for such operations, as they often extract files to temp locations and clean up afterward.\n\nThe events seem to show a normal part of the DISM process: loading various provider DLLs into memory (which is standard when running DISM commands) and then deleting them after termination. There's nothing unusual here in terms of file paths or activity patterns that would indicate malicious behavior. No signs of unauthorized access, encryption, or other red flags.\n\nSince all these events are part of the normal operation of DISM, which is a legitimate Windows utility, I don't see any cause for concern. The combination of loading and then deleting files in a temp directory fits expected behavior during setup or updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of normal DISM operations, including loading DLLs into memory and cleaning up temporary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All the JSON objects are similar; each has a process named \"Dism.exe\", some Windows log task details, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dism.exe does. From what I know, Dism is the Deployment Image Service Manager, used for servicing Windows images. It's part of the operating system and handles tasks like installing updates or managing components.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are File Delete logged events with different files being deleted. The paths all point to temporary folders under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. These are standard locations for temporary files, so that makes sense in a way.\n\nBut wait, why is Dism.exe deleting multiple files? I know that during an image deployment or servicing operation, Dism might create and then delete temporary files as part of its normal operations. So seeing several deletions could just be part of the process.\n\nHowever, let's check the number of events. There are 14 events here, all within a short timeframe. If these were spread out over days, it might not raise flags, but multiple deletes in quick succession could indicate something suspicious. But considering Dism's normal operations involve batch processing, this might be expected.\n\nAlso, looking at the files being deleted: they're DLLs and MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files for different components like AppxProvider, AssocProvider, etc. These are legitimate system files that would be part of Windows servicing packs or updates. So deleting them as part of a cleanup after an operation seems normal.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? I don't see anything out of the ordinary in terms of file paths or names. They all follow standard naming conventions for system components, and they're being deleted by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process.\n\nThe confidence level: Since all these events fit within what's expected from Dism during servicing operations and there's no evidence of unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior, I would classify this as NOT INTERESTING.

Let me start by looking at each event to understand what's going on.\n\nEach line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"Dism.exe\". Dism stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management, which I know is a Microsoft tool used for servicing Windows images. It's typically used during the setup or configuration of a system, so it's not something that runs regularly once the system is up and running.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every event has the same task: \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". So each event is logging a file deletion. That makes sense because Dism.exe would be handling files during its operations.\n\nThe file paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\[provider DLL]. The filename varies but follows the pattern of Provider.dll, like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, and so on. These seem to be temporary files stored in a temp directory with a specific GUID as part of the path.\n\nPutting this together: Dism.exe is deleting several DLL files from a temporary directory. Since these are temp files under AppData\\Local\\Temp, it's likely part of normal servicing operations when cleaning up after an image deployment or similar process.\n\nI should consider why someone might think this is suspicious. Malware often deletes files to cover its tracks, but in this case, the file paths and process name make it look legitimate. Dism.exe is a known system process, and deleting temporary files is standard behavior for such tools.\n\nIs there any reason to suspect malicious activity here? I don't see anything unusual. The same process is doing multiple deletions of temp files, which fits normal operation patterns.

Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything unusual.\n\nThe first event has a PowerShell command that creates a new service using \"New-Service\" and starts it with \"Start-Service\". The binary path points to an exe file in a directory named \"registro_comum\", which translates to \"common registry\". That seems suspicious because creating a new service can be a sign of malicious activity, like installing a backdoor. However, I'm not sure if this alone is enough.\n\nLooking at the next seven events, they all run PowerShell with \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" and output \"Final result: 1\". This execution policy is usually stricter, so it's allowed here but the command seems simple—just writing to the host. It doesn't look malicious on its own, but repeated identical commands might indicate something.\n\nThen there are more events where the command checks for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. The script reads each INF file and looks for lines matching a regular expression related to installation sections. This seems like it's checking for certain driver installations or system components. It could be legitimate, maybe part of an audit or system check, but it might also be trying to gather information about installed drivers, which can be part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch starts with creating a service and then several checks on INF files. The repeated commands suggest automation or scripting. While some parts could be benign admin tasks, others like creating a new service without a clear purpose are red flags. The combination of different PowerShell activities over time might indicate lateral movement or establishing persistence. There's also the possibility that the script is part of an attack chain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the potential malicious activity, especially the creation of a new service and the repeated checks on system files.

So, Dism.exe is detecting multiple executable files in a temporary directory.\n\nMoving further down, there's an event involving \"DismHost.exe\" being created:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'DismHost.exe', 'command_line': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\\\dismhost.exe {3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\n\nThen, several entries show DismHost.exe loading various DLLs into memory:\n\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'DismHost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\\\DismCorePS.dll'}\"}\n```\n\nand similar for other DLLs.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about what Dism.exe and DismHost.exe do. From what I remember, these are related to the Windows Deployment Services. Dism.exe is used for servicing Windows images (WIM files), like adding or removing features, drivers, etc. It's typically used during deployment or maintenance tasks.\n\nThe temporary directory path in each event is unique: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`. This looks like a GUID, which is common for temporary directories created by various processes to avoid name conflicts.\n\nSo the process seems to be:\n\n1. Dism.exe is being executed.\n2. It's detecting multiple executable files in its temporary directory (the DLLs).\n3. Then, DismHost.exe is being spawned as a child process with a specific command line argument that looks like a GUID.\n4. After that, DismHost.exe loads several DLLs from the same temp directory.\n\nI need to assess whether this behavior is normal or potentially malicious.\n\nIn a legitimate scenario, when using tools like DISM for image servicing, these steps are standard. The process creates temporary files and loads necessary components (DLLs) into memory as part of its operation. It's common for such tools to have multiple dependencies and dynamically load modules during runtime.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any red flag here. The fact that all the files are in a temp directory generated with a GUID is standard for processes needing isolation or temporary storage. There's no indication of file creation dates, hashes, or other attributes that might suggest these files are malicious.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools and process names to hide their activities. Could this be an instance where Dism.exe or DismHost.exe is being abused? For example, maybe a malicious payload is masquerading as one of these processes.\n\nTo check this, I'd look into the file hashes or creation times of these DLLs. But since the events don't include that information, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, if there are multiple such events over time from different users or machines, it might indicate a broader issue, but in this case, it's just one batch.\n\nThe command line for DismHost.exe includes a GUID as an argument: `{3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}`. That might be specific to the operation being performed, perhaps identifying a particular task or configuration.\n\nAnother point is that all these events are occurring in the same temp directory, which suggests a single process execution. There's no evidence of multiple unrelated processes using the same temp folder, which would raise more suspicion.\n\nGiven all this, I think it's more likely that this is a legitimate use of DISM tools for servicing or deployment purposes. The detection of executable files and loading of DLLs by Dism.exe and DismHost.exe are standard behaviors in such scenarios.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, if I had access to the file hashes or could correlate these events with other logs (like network activity), I might find more clues. But based on what's provided here, there's no strong indication of malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor for any unexpected use of deployment tools, in this case, the batch doesn't present a clear sign of an attack or suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal execution of DISM-related processes and file detections, which are legitimate activities during system deployment or maintenance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It's a PowerShell command running with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. The command is checking INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns related to installation sections. This seems like it could be part of legitimate system checks, maybe automated scripts looking for driver info or something similar. But I also know that PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands. So, the combination of restricted execution policy and file scanning might raise some flags.\n\nSecond event: Same as the first one. Identical command line and task. This repetition could be part of a script loop or maybe an indicator of something trying multiple times, which is a bit concerning.\n\nThird event: No process info but a logon related to Security Group Management. That's usually normal for user activity, especially if it's an internal system change or group policy updates. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nFourth event: Services.exe is running and there's a Logon task. Services.exe is part of Windows and handles service-related operations, so this seems routine unless it's paired with other unusual activities.\n\nFifth event: Special logon without a process. Special logons are typically for system processes or services, which are normal. So nothing wrong here.\n\nPutting it all together, the first two events with PowerShell accessing INF files might be worth investigating because they could indicate something malicious like trying to gather information for an attack. The repetition adds some concern. However, without more context, I'm not sure if this is actual malicious behavior or just a legitimate script running checks. There's enough potential risk that it should be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell commands checking INF files for specific patterns, which could indicate malicious activity such as attempting to gather system information or deploying drivers. The repetition of these events adds concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what's going on with this cybersecurity alert. Let me start by looking at the data provided. It seems like there are multiple logs here, each containing information about a process and some kind of Windows log task.\n\nFirst, I notice that most entries have \"process\" details, sometimes including the command line used or the file path. For example, there's an entry where a service named \"objeto_ativo\" is being created using PowerShell. The command line shows that it's executing a script to create this new service and start it. That seems a bit suspicious because creating services can be part of malicious activities like persistence.\n\nI also see references to \"Registry value set\" tasks in the Windows logs, which might mean that something is modifying the system's registry. Malware often does this to ensure it starts on boot or to hide itself.\n\nLooking at some other entries, there are processes like \"services.exe\", \"svchost.exe\", and \"sppsvc.exe\". Some of these are legitimate Windows processes, but they can sometimes be used by malware as well. For example, svchost is a common host process for services, so it's not inherently bad, but if something unusual is happening with it, that could be a red flag.\n\nThere's also mention of \"Windows Update Agent\" in the logs. I wonder if this is related to any known exploits or if there's an attempt to impersonate update processes to spread malware.\n\nThe user mentioned that some entries repeat multiple times, especially the PowerShell command creating and starting a new service. This repetition could indicate automated malicious activity trying to set up persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm thinking about what actions I would take as a cybersecurity analyst in this situation. First, I'd probably want to check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service on the system or if it's something that wasn't installed by authorized personnel. Maybe I can look into the file path mentioned: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. If this path isn't standard, that service might be malicious.\n\nNext, I'd examine the registry changes to see what keys or values were modified. Unusual entries in the run key or system startup could point to persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nI also need to consider if these activities are part of a known attack pattern. The use of PowerShell for process creation and service management is common in attacks because it's often allowed through standard security policies but can be used to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAnother thing I might do is check the system's event logs for more details around the time these entries were made. Looking at other events happening simultaneously could provide context—like if there were failed logins or other suspicious activities nearby.\n\nI should also look into the file paths mentioned. The path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\" doesn't seem like a standard Windows directory, so it's possible that this is where the attacker stored their malicious files.\n\nSince the alert is about potential malware activity, I might want to perform a deep scan using antivirus software or use tools like Process Monitor to see what files and registry entries are being accessed by these processes.\n\nIf \"objeto_ativo\" is indeed unauthorized, I should probably stop the service immediately and remove it. Also, checking for any other signs of compromise, like additional services or hidden files, would be important.\n\nIn summary, the key points I'm seeing are:\n1. Creation and start of a new service via PowerShell.\n2. Modifications to the registry.\n3. Use of legitimate system processes in potentially malicious ways.\n4. Unusual file paths associated with these activities.\n\nI think the next steps would involve verifying the legitimacy of the \"objeto_ativo\" service, investigating the registry changes, and scanning for any signs of malware on the affected system. It's also important to consider network traffic around this time to check if data is being exfiltrated or if there are communications with external servers.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Look for processes created by PowerShell commands, especially those creating new services (e.g., `objeto_ativo`). These could be indicators of malicious activity aiming to establish persistence.\n\n2. **Check File Paths:**\n   - Examine the file paths mentioned in the logs. Unusual or non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum`) suggest potential malware storage locations.\n\n3. **Analyze Registry Changes:**\n   - Investigate any registry modifications, focusing on areas like the run key or system startup entries, which are common targets for persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Review Event Logs:**\n   - Look at the broader context of events around the suspicious activity. Check for related events like failed logins or other anomalies that could indicate a breach.\n\n5. **Monitor Network Traffic:**\n   - Inspect network traffic to detect any data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which might suggest a command-and-control channel.\n\n6. **Use Tools for Deeper Analysis:**\n   - Employ tools like Process Monitor and antivirus software to scan for unauthorized processes and file activities.\n\n7. **Take Action Against Malicious Elements:**\n   - If unauthorized services are found, stop and remove them immediately. Address any identified malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs indicate potential malicious activity involving service creation via PowerShell, registry modifications, and the use of legitimate system processes for nefarious purposes. To mitigate this, verify the legitimacy of new services, investigate file and registry changes, scan for malware, and consider network monitoring to prevent further compromise."}
