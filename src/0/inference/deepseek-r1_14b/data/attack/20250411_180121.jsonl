{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by examining each event individually and then consider the entire batch together.\n\nThe first few entries are all related to 'chrome.exe' performing DNS queries and establishing network connections. These seem normal because Chrome is known to perform such actions when browsing the web or accessing online services. However, I should keep an eye out for any unusual patterns or repeated activities that might indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, there's a series of events involving 'powershell.exe'. The first one shows that a new process was created with a command line that includes downloading files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, it uses the DownloadFile method to get files into the TEMP directory. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be exploited for malicious purposes, such as downloading and executing malware.\n\nI notice multiple events where 'powershell.exe' accesses registry values and loads images like mscoree.dll and others from various system directories. While these actions might seem normal at first glance, the combination of accessing the registry and loading specific modules could indicate an attempt to execute code or modify system configurations in a way that's unusual.\n\nThere are also events where files are created and then deleted in the TEMP directory. For example, '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1' is created and then immediately deleted. This behavior might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by testing script execution or clearing evidence after running malicious code.\n\nLooking further down, there are more 'powershell.exe' processes with similar command lines, each downloading different files from various GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory under names like 'entrada_comum.txt', 'unidade_ativo.txt', etc. This repeated activity of downloading files using PowerShell is a red flag. It suggests that an attacker might be attempting to retrieve multiple components or modules as part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, the key points are:\n1. Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' downloading files from GitHub repositories.\n2. Creation and deletion of temporary script files that could indicate malicious activity testing.\n3. Registry access and loading of system modules which might be part of payload execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not raise immediate concerns, the combination suggests a potential attack vector. The repeated use of PowerShell for downloading files, coupled with file creation\/deletion in TEMP, points towards possible script execution or malicious payload delivery. Additionally, accessing registry values could be part of establishing persistence or modifying system settings to allow further attacks.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is likely indicative of malicious activity and warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. This includes suspicious file creation and deletion patterns, as well as registry access, indicating potential malicious activities such as script execution or payload delivery.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, there are several entries where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used in scripting and can be abused for malicious purposes like downloading malware or scripts. The URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com, which isn't inherently bad, but the fact that they're downloading files into temporary locations (like %env:TEMP%) might indicate something suspicious. Malware often uses such techniques to hide its presence.\n\nLooking closer, there are three instances where powershell.exe is used with DownloadFile from different repositories:\n1. \"objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" → C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt\n2. \"elemento_principal\/pacote_geral\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" → C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_logico.txt\n3. \"unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" → C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\tarefa_ativo.txt\n\nThese seem like different modules or components being downloaded, which could be part of a larger script or payload. The file names are generic, but the fact that they're all .txt files might be an attempt to disguise malicious code.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries where chrome.exe is modifying the registry with 'Registry value set'. While Chrome does update the registry for settings and extensions, doing this repeatedly without any other activity could be a sign of something else. Maybe it's part of some persistence mechanism or configuration change that's unusual.\n\nThere are also several events related to winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. This is interesting because winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding Windows logs to Elasticsearch. The fact that it's writing a .yml.new file might be normal during setup, but the frequency of these entries could indicate something amiss, like potential tampering with log configurations or attempts to rotate logs.\n\nAnother point is the process MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. This service is part of Windows Defender, so it's normal for it to monitor and block malicious connections. However, if there were actual threats being detected, we might see more events related to that.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries involving conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry, as well as notepad.exe doing similar actions. While these processes can perform registry operations normally, their frequency or combination with other activities could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell.exe downloads into temp directories and the registry modifications across multiple legitimate-sounding processes create a concerning pattern. It seems like there might be an attempt at persistence through scheduled tasks, registry keys, or startup scripts. The use of temporary files suggests that the malware doesn't want to leave evidence on disk for too long, which is a common tactic.\n\nI'm also considering whether these could be parts of a larger script execution. For instance, downloading multiple modules from different repositories might be an attempt to evade detection by splitting malicious code across different sources or to execute them at different times.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe writing files frequently makes me think about log tampering. If someone is trying to cover their tracks, they might delete logs after some activity, and having a tool like winlogbeat could be involved in that process.\n\nIn summary, while some of these events on their own aren't necessarily malicious, the combination—especially the powershell.exe downloads and the repeated registry modifications across various processes—points towards potentially suspicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is using these tools to establish a foothold on the system, download components of malware, and ensure persistence through registry changes.\n\nI think it's important to check if any of these files in the temp directory or those created by winlogbeat.exe are malicious. Additionally, reviewing the recent log entries for signs of unauthorized access or deletions could provide more context. Monitoring these processes over time might reveal more about their true nature and whether they're part of a coordinated attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits concerning patterns that suggest potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Downloads**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories. This is suspicious due to the use of a common scripting tool for potentially malicious purposes.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Several processes, including chrome.exe and others, show repeated registry value sets. While normal for some applications, the frequency and combination with other activities could indicate persistence mechanisms or tampering.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity**: Frequent file creation by winlogbeat.exe might suggest log manipulation attempts, possibly to hide malicious activity.\n\n4. **MpDefenderCoreService Network Detection**: Indicates potential threat detection, though details are limited without additional context.\n\n5. **Other Processes**: Conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and notepad.exe accessing the registry could be part of a broader malicious script or persistence routine.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combined activities point to possible malicious intent, including establishing persistence and log tampering. Further investigation into the files downloaded by powershell.exe and recent system logs is recommended to confirm suspicions."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event is process calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are common Windows processes. Next, svchost.exe setting a registry value—that's a bit suspicious since svchost is often used by malware to hide processes. But I see it happening multiple times with similar tasks, which could indicate repeated attempts.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. That's another red flag because legitimate apps usually don't load such DLLs. Powershell.exe being accessed a few times—Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. The use of cmd.exe with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks might be trying to remove scheduled jobs, which is a common tactic in malware to cover their tracks.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process created, which could be used to gather system information. Powershell again accessing processes and modifying the registry—this seems like someone is trying to elevate privileges or modify system configurations. The use of reg.exe deleting registry keys under HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE... suggests efforts to remove traces of previous activities.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple instances of svchost, calc, powershell, cmd, schtasks, and reg being used with commands that modify processes, registry entries, and scheduled tasks—this definitely looks like a coordinated effort. The pattern of deleting tasks and registry keys points towards an attacker trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nI'm also noticing repeated use of Powershell and command-line tools, which are common in scripts for malicious activities. The combination of these actions over multiple events makes me think this isn't just regular user activity but a potential attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the log shows several indicators of possible unauthorized access or malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential unauthorized access or malware activity:\n\n1. **Multiple Suspicious Processes**: The repeated use of svchost.exe, which is often exploited by malware for process hiding, along with Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, suggests possible malicious activities.\n\n2. **Powershell Usage**: The frequent invocation of Powershell.exe is a red flag due to its common use in executing malicious scripts and command injections.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Commands using reg.exe and cmd.exe to delete registry keys under HKCU indicate efforts to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools, typical of malware attempting to cover its tracks.\n\n4. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**: Use of SCHTASKS to delete scheduled tasks suggests an attempt to disrupt system monitoring or persistence mechanisms.\n\n5. **Elevation Attempts**: The use of whoami.exe and other command-line tools may indicate efforts to gather system information or elevate privileges.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of these activities strongly suggests a potential security incident, likely involving malware attempting to compromise the system by hiding processes, modifying configurations, and erasing evidence. Immediate investigation and response are advisable."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs, all in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. Let me try to make sense of them one by one.\n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe being involved in some tasks like ProcessAccess and Provider Lifecycle. I know that PowerShell can be legitimate for administrative tasks, but it's often used by attackers too because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The repeated occurrence with the same command line 'powershell.exe & {}' is a bit unusual—maybe it's part of some automation or script execution.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is setting registry values and accessing files like mscoree.dll, which I recognize as part of .NET Framework. That doesn't immediately sound suspicious on its own because legitimate apps use that too. But the combination with other activities might be a red flag.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe creates temporary files in C:\\Users\\...\\\\Temp. Specifically, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 that gets created and then deleted shortly after. That script name seems odd; it looks like some kind of test or perhaps an attempt to bypass certain security policies. The fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might be an indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clean up their traces.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs when powershell.exe runs. That's normal if it's executing scripts that require those libraries. But I should check if any of these DLL paths look suspicious or linked to known malware.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder, which is part of PowerShell's profile system. This could be a place where malicious scripts might store configuration or other files for persistence across sessions. If this file was created by powershell.exe, it could indicate that something is trying to set up a persistent presence on the system.\n\nAnother point is the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new in a user's Downloads folder by winlogbeat.exe. I'm not sure if that's related or just part of log management. It doesn't seem directly suspicious but worth noting if other events tie back to it.\n\nI also see some Pipe Created events, which might be communication between processes. PowerShell often creates pipes for inter-process communication, so alone it's not concerning, but combined with other activities, it could indicate command-and-control behavior.\n\nConsidering the overall batch, the repeated use of powershell.exe with odd command lines and the creation\/deletion of temporary script files are red flags. Additionally, accessing certain registry keys and loading specific DLLs might be part of a larger malicious process. The combination of these events over time suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch seems interesting because multiple indicators point towards possible exploitation or attack vectors using PowerShell in a way that's not typical for everyday usage.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided system logs reveals several concerning activities indicative of potential malicious behavior. Here is a structured summary:\n\n1. **Repeated Powershell Activity**: The consistent use of `powershell.exe` with command lines like `'powershell.exe & {}'` suggests possible automation or script execution, which can be a vector for attacks.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications and File Access**: Powershell accessing registry values and files such as mscoree.dll, while not inherently suspicious, could indicate malicious activity when combined with other behaviors.\n\n3. **Suspicious Script Creation and Deletion**: The creation and subsequent deletion of the temporary script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1` raises concerns about an attempt to hide traces, a common tactic in malware.\n\n4. **File Creation in Startup Folder**: A file created in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` by powershell.exe could be part of a persistence mechanism, allowing malicious scripts to run on subsequent sessions.\n\n5. **Pipe Created Events**: These events, while common in PowerShell operations, might indicate communication for command-and-control activities when combined with other signs.\n\n6. **Log File Creation**: The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` by `winlogbeat.exe` is noted but appears unrelated to malicious activity unless linked to other indicators.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of these events—especially the use of powershell.exe for potentially malicious scripting, temporary file manipulation, and registry access—points towards possible exploitation or attack vectors. This batch of logs merits further investigation to determine if a security incident has occurred."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Processes named powershell.exe are appearing multiple times with different tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nI also see that some events involve creating temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, specifically a script file being created and then deleted quickly. That's a red flag because adversaries might use such techniques to execute malicious scripts without leaving long traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances of whoami.exe and cmd.exe being run, which could be used for reconnaissance or privilege escalation. The repeated Registry value sets across various processes suggest potential attempts to modify system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or alter security settings.\n\nLooking at the events together, the high frequency of PowerShell commands with file creation and deletion, combined with registry modifications, indicates possible malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated usage could be a red flag. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that seem suspicious. For example, one event shows the command line as \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This script is attempting to delete a file in the TEMP directory, which might be trying to cover tracks by removing evidence of previous activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value set events from powershell.exe. Modifying the Windows Registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on system startup or to make changes that persist across reboots. This kind of activity is often seen in malicious software trying to maintain access or alter system configurations.\n\nI also see multiple Pipe Created tasks, both from powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Creating pipes can be a way for processes to communicate, but in some cases, it's used by malware to establish inter-process communication for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point of concern is the use of whoami.exe. While this tool is legitimate and often used to determine user information, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities might indicate an attempt to gather system credentials or lateral movement within a network.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated Image loaded events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs could be indicative of malicious code being injected into legitimate processes. This technique can help bypass certain security measures by hiding malicious activity within trusted binaries.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple instances of powershell.exe with potentially harmful command lines, registry modifications, pipe creations, and the use of whoami.exe—the batch shows a pattern that is not typical of normal user activity. These actions are often associated with attack vectors such as persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile there's no definitive proof of malicious intent here, the combination of events raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation. It's possible that this could be part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) activity, ransomware, or other forms of malware attempting to establish a foothold in the system.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch is classified as interesting because it exhibits multiple indicators of potentially malicious behavior that, when considered together, suggest a compromise or attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated powershell.exe executions with potential malicious commands, registry modifications, pipe creations, and use of whoami.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines deleting files in the TEMP directory. Deleting multiple files could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're using different filenames each time.\n\nThe user also created and then deleted a PowerShell script file. This behavior might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or download something malicious because scripts can often be used for such purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there are logs showing image loading of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender's Platform directory. These files are related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, but seeing them loaded in the context of powershell.exe could be suspicious if they're being used to bypass or interfere with security measures.\n\nThe combination of creating a script file, deleting multiple temporary files, and loading antivirus components might suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity or execute commands that aren't easily detectable. The extensive use of powershell.exe is notable because it's a common tool for both legitimate scripting and for executing malicious commands, especially with obfuscation techniques.\n\nMoreover, the presence of various files being deleted from TEMP could be part of a cleanup process after an attack. This pattern raises concerns about potential malware trying to erase evidence or perform persistence activities.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the batch seems like it could be indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, it's interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file deletions from TEMP using PowerShell and involves potential script execution and antivirus-related activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the first event is a Process Create task for powershell.exe with a command line that removes a file in TEMP. That seems suspicious because PowerShell can be used for malicious purposes, especially when deleting files without user interaction.\n\nThe second event shows Process Access for powershell.exe. Not too concerning on its own, but combined with others, it might indicate something.\n\nThird, there's a Registry value set by powershell.exe. This is interesting because changing registry settings can allow persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nNext, several Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but the specific DLLs could be checked for anything unusual.\n\nThen, multiple File Create and Delete events in TEMP files with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24... These look like temporary script files created by PowerShell. The fact that they're deleted shortly after creation might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are several Provider Lifecycle events for powershell.exe removing files in TEMP. Repeated deletions of similar files could be part of a cleanup routine to erase traces of malicious activity.\n\nA File Create event from winlogbeat.exe seems benign, probably part of log management software.\n\nThere's an Engine Lifecycle event and more Process Access tasks. These could be part of normal script execution or possibly checking for other processes.\n\nThe last few events include Registry changes by conhost.exe, which is typically a host process for console applications. That might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is usually harmless unless used in conjunction with other malicious activities.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry, creating and deleting files, especially in TEMP directories. The repeated attempts to remove specific .txt files could indicate an attempt to clean up after some malicious activity or perhaps dropping backdoors or persistence mechanisms. The temporary script file creations and deletions might be part of a process to execute code without leaving traces.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe with command lines that remove files is a red flag because attackers often misuse PowerShell for such activities. The combination of registry modifications, file operations in TEMP, and multiple process accesses could indicate a potential malicious script running on the system.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows signs that might warrant further investigation into possible malicious activity using PowerShell.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are detected with command lines performing file deletions in the TEMP directory. This is concerning as attackers often misuse PowerShell for executing scripts.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Powershell.exe sets registry values, which could be part of creating persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - Creation and subsequent deletion of temporary script files in the TEMP directory suggests an attempt to avoid detection by removing traces of executed scripts.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Repeated deletions of specific .txt files by powershell.exe might indicate a cleanup routine to erase evidence of malicious activities.\n\n5. ** benign Activities:**\n   - The winlogbeat.exe creating a file and the whoami.exe process are less concerning but should be monitored for any anomalies in context.\n\n6. **Conhost.exe Activity:**\n   - While typically harmless, registry changes by conhost.exe merit attention when combined with other suspicious activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. The misuse of PowerShell for file operations, registry modifications, and temporary script management suggests a need for further investigation to determine if the system is compromised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are quite a few entries here, so I'll need to go through them carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the early events involve 'chrome.exe' with registry value sets. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because Chrome is a common process and modifying the registry isn't unusual for legitimate software updates or settings changes. However, multiple instances could be worth looking into if they're happening outside expected times or in bulk.\n\nThen there are events from 'RuntimeBroker.exe'. This is another system-related process, so I don't see any cause for concern here right now.\n\nThe next set of events catches my eye because they involve 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. PowerShell can be a red flag if used inappropriately since it's often associated with scripting and automation that could be malicious. The 'Process accessed' tasks might indicate someone trying to run scripts or commands, which is something to monitor.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process creates are also notable because they're typically used to check user identities. If these processes are being executed frequently without a clear reason, it could be part of an attempt to gather information about the system's users.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its own directory. That seems a bit suspicious because if the log shipping tool is creating new files, especially immediately after installation or configuration changes, it might indicate tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nFinally, another PowerShell process creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename doesn't give much away, but combined with previous PowerShell activity, this could be part of an attack chain where malicious scripts are being written to disk for execution.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of legitimate processes being used in ways that seem repetitive and possibly automated, along with the creation of files by potentially malicious tools.
