{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'll go through each event one by one and see if there's any pattern or signs of malicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: It's chrome.exe making a DNS query. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time to resolve domain names.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing the registry. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks. But without more context, I can't be sure if it's malicious.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe running systeminfo and reg query. Systeminfo is a standard tool to display system information, but querying the registry like that could be part of an attack to gather info or modify settings.\n\nAnother powershell process accessing another process – not immediately suspicious unless it's trying to do something it shouldn't.\n\nCmd.exe again setting a registry value. This might be normal for some scripts, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nsysteminfo.exe being run and loading AMSI DLL and MpOAV DLL. These are legitimate Windows components used for antivirus and protection, so that doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nNotepad.exe modifying the registry – not unusual if someone is using it for script execution or manual configuration.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll – standard system processes usually don't indicate anything wrong here.\n\nsvchost.exe creating files in winevt Logs. SvcHost is known to run legitimate services, but sometimes malware can hide under its name. However, the paths look like standard Windows logs.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe starting with a command line. WMI is often used for remote management and by various tools, so this could be normal admin activity or part of an attack. The presence of wmiutils DLL is expected in legitimate operations.\n\nCmd.exe again accessing the registry, conhost.exe doing similar – these might just be scripts running commands.\n\nServices.exe and winlogbeat are standard system services, likely not malicious. Special logon events might relate to system startups or service accounts.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry – this usually relates to UI elements in Windows apps, so probably benign.\n\nAnother powershell process accessing the registry again, chrome.exe creating a pipe and modifying the registry.\n\nLooking at all these together, most of the events are standard system processes doing normal things. There's some use of cmd and powershell which could be red flags, but without evidence of unusual command lines or access to sensitive areas, it's hard to classify this as malicious activity. I don't see any obvious indicators like dropped files, unusual network connections, or writes to unexpected locations.\n\nSo, overall, the batch doesn't seem particularly concerning. It might just be normal user activity with some script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system processes and common tools like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and chrome.exe performing typical activities such as registry access and DNS queries. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple events from Chrome.exe where registry values are being set. There are quite a few of these—about 14 instances. While legitimate applications do modify the registry during operation, such a high frequency might be suspicious. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll. AMSI is related to Anti-Malware Scanning Interface, so it's part of Windows' defense mechanisms. However, sometimes attackers inject malicious code into legitimate processes, which might trigger such a module. This could indicate an attempt to hide or obfuscate activities.\n\nThere are also some events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely just capturing logs, so that's probably benign. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers; the creation of 'objeto_padrao.txt' might be part of data exfiltration or persistence scripts, but it's not conclusive.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple registry writes by Chrome, potential DLL injection, and other process activities—the batch seems to warrant closer examination. However, without more context on user behavior or additional anomalies, the suspicion is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry value modifications by chrome.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that may be unusual.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
