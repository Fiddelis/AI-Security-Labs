{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. Chrome is a common browser, and these connections are normal for browsing activities, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears multiple times. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The events show process access, registry modifications, and file operations like creating and deleting files in the Temp directory. Specifically, there's a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1 being created and then deleted. This might be an attempt to test or bypass certain security policies, which is concerning.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad events for various .dll files when running PowerShell. While some of these are standard .NET framework components, others like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll could be part of malicious activities if they're loaded in a suspicious context.\n\nAnother event involves whoami.exe being executed from the command line. This is often used to check user permissions or identity, which isn't inherently bad but can be part of reconnaissance by attackers.\n\nAdditionally, there are RegistryEvent tasks for powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe. These registry accesses could indicate configuration changes that might be malicious.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell with various file operations and registry modifications, along with script creation and deletion in Temp, raises red flags. This combination is often used by attackers to execute scripts or establish persistence without being detected immediately.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, including file operations and registry modifications, along with the creation and deletion of a script in Temp directory. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each with a process, winlog task, and file information. The user wants me to analyze all events together, so I'll need to look for patterns across them.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n- ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values.\n- There's also a powershell.exe accessing a process.\n- Chrome.exe is creating pipes and modifying registry values multiple times.\n\nI notice that chrome.exe has several RegistryEvent tasks. That's a lot of registry writes—maybe too many for normal browsing. But I don't see any other red flags with chrome.exe, like loading malicious DLLs or file creations outside the usual paths.\n\nThen there are events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating files in user directories. Winlogbeat is likely a log forwarding tool, so that's probably benign. The powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt' doesn't immediately raise a red flag unless it's trying to hide something.\n\nHowever, the high number of RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe stands out. While some registry activity is normal, multiple writes in quick succession might indicate suspicious behavior. This could be part of an attempt to persistence or modify system configurations maliciously.\n\nOther processes like Calculator.exe and powershell.exe also have registry activity, but not as频繁or in the same volume as chrome.exe. The pipe created by ApplicationFrameHost.exe doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nConsidering all events together, while most are typical user activity and application behavior, the excessive RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe are a point of interest. This could be an attempt to modify system settings or hide malicious activities, making the batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modification events from Chrome.exe and other processes, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve changing the LastWriteTime of various files. The paths look a bit odd with names like \"modulo_logico\", \"estrutura_secundario\", and \"componente_temporariopacote_principal.txt\". This kind of activity could be suspicious because altering file timestamps is often used in malicious activities to hide changes or make files appear older than they are.\n\nThen, there are several instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be exploited by malware. Multiple registry modifications might indicate some form of persistence or configuration change that's worth looking into.\n\nThere's also an entry where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but sometimes legitimate processes can be used as part of an attack chain, so it's something to keep in mind.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Conhost is a Windows component that's generally not malicious, but its presence here might be just normal unless there's more context. Winlogbeat is likely related to log management; however, one instance creating a configuration file isn't inherently suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the event types, many are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which relate to PowerShell's internal operations. The fact that these events are repeated with similar command structures makes me lean towards something potentially malicious, as attackers might use such patterns to execute scripts or modify files without detection.\n\nThe last entry shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is concerning because modifying startup profiles can indicate attempts to maintain persistence across reboots, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with command-line arguments that alter file times and the modifications to registry entries by svchost.exe are red flags. These activities could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or establish persistence, making this batch definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes altering file timestamps and creating files in user directories, along with svchost.exe modifying registry values, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
