{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not. I'll go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where powershell.exe is being executed and accessed. Powershell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a vector for attacks. The command lines in some events have \"& {}\" which seems unusual, possibly trying to hide the actual command or making it non-functional.\n\nNext, there are multiple Registry value sets by powershell.exe. This could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms, which is concerning as attackers often set registry keys to maintain access.\n\nLooking at file operations, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The filename \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1\" suggests it might be related to script testing or configuration, but the creation followed by deletion could be part of an attack to avoid detection.\n\nThe events also show several Image Load tasks for various DLLs when powershell.exe runs. This is normal for PowerShell as it loads these components, but in this context, combined with other activities, it might indicate malicious behavior like loading malicious modules or scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for powershell.exe. These could relate to how PowerShell initializes and manages its runtime environment, which might be part of a more complex script execution.\n\nFinally, the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe isn't immediately suspicious on its own but should be checked in context.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple powershell executions with unusual command lines, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and loading various DLLs—all these factors combined could indicate potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with unusual command lines, registry modifications, file operations in Temp directory suggesting possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst up, there's a process named WMIC.exe with an image load task. That catches my eye because WMIC can be used for malicious purposes, like remote command execution. The file path points to MpOAV.dll which is part of Windows Defender, so that might just be normal Defender activity. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, several events show notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe all performing registry value sets. Registry changes can be indicators of malicious activities, especially if they're modifying system configurations to hide processes or create persistence. However, these are common tools, so it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process running with the command line pointing to its default location. This is usually harmless as it just reports user information. But sometimes attackers use it for lateral movement, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is a double-edged sword; while legitimate for scripting, it's often abused by malware for execution and persistence. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks might indicate some suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. This seems concerning because replacing system files like sethc can be part of creating persistent backdoors or disabling security features. The schtasks commands deleting 'win32times' task could be an attempt to remove scheduled tasks for persistence.\n\nAnother command line is schtasks.exe deleting the same 'win32times' task, which might suggest an attack where they're trying to cover their tracks by removing evidence of malicious tasks.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high-risk processes (WMIC, powershell) with suspicious activities like file copying and task deletion. The repeated registry modifications across different processes could be part of setting up persistence or altering system configurations to hide malicious activities. These actions don't seem to fit normal user behavior and are indicative of potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious process activities including WMIC.exe, PowerShell, and cmd.exe with potentially malicious command lines.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The user mentioned that each event is in JSONL format, so there are multiple events here.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal since it's part of Windows.\n2. Notepad.exe also setting a registry value. Notpad is a common app, but why would it interact with the registry? Maybe legitimate, but worth noting.\n3. Powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be malicious if not monitored.\n4. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems standard as it's a system file.\n5. Svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a known process that runs services; this might be normal or could indicate something like a service configuration change.\n6. Another svchost.exe event doing the same thing as above.\n7. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again, which aligns with calc's usual behavior.\n8. Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory—this is likely part of their logging setup and not suspicious.\n9. Whoami.exe being run from the command line, which is a basic system info tool; probably benign unless used maliciously.\n10. Powershell.exe accessing processes again.\n11. Cmd.exe running a wmic command to delete notepad.exe. Deleting processes via command line can be part of legitimate scripts or could indicate malware trying to terminate something.\n12. WMIC.exe creating a process and deleting notepad.exe, which is similar to the cmd command but directly from wmic, another red flag.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are multiple instances where powershell, cmd, and wmic are being used with commands that could be part of malicious activities, like process deletion or accessing system components. The repeated use of registry events by various processes might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. Also, the combination of different tools (powershell, cmd, wmic) using similar actions raises suspicion.\n\nI'm considering confidence as 0.8 because while some events individually are not alarming, the pattern across multiple processes and commands suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation, registry modifications, and file operations involving potentially suspicious tools like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and wmic.exe indicate possible malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a process named schtasks.exe with an ImageLoad event loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks in Windows, so I don't think that's suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, svchost.exe has a RegistryEvent for adding or deleting registry objects. Svchost is a common process for services, so some registry activity isn't unusual here.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes with various events like Process Create and RegistryEvent. These are standard command-line tools that can be used for legitimate tasks but might also be used in malicious activities. However, just having them run or modify the registry doesn't necessarily mean something's wrong unless they're doing something unexpected.\n\nI notice multiple entries of powershell.exe with different tasks—like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. Multiple instances might be a red flag, but I need to see what exactly each instance is doing. Since the specific actions aren't detailed here, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are also chrome.exe events related to ImageLoad and RegistryEvent. Chrome is a common browser, so these activities are likely normal unless they involve loading unusual modules or accessing sensitive registry keys.\n\nLooking at the whoami.exe entries, this is a standard command used to get user information. While it can be part of legitimate scripts, attackers might also use it to gather system info. But without more context, I don't see anything immediately suspicious here.\n\nI'm seeing a pattern where several processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being created multiple times. This could indicate script execution or automated tasks, but it's not conclusive evidence of malicious activity on its own.\n\nThe events don't show any anomalies like unexpected file creations, network connections, or deletions. Everything seems to revolve around process creation and registry modifications, which can be part of legitimate operations.\n\nSince there are multiple powershell.exe instances, I'm cautious because attackers often use PowerShell for obfuscation and persistence. But without seeing actual malicious commands being executed, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, some events could be normal user activity, especially if scripts or automated tools are running on the system. Without additional context like timestamps, user accounts involved, or specific actions taken, I can't definitively say these activities are malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because while there's some elevated activity, it doesn't cross into clear indicators of compromise. However, the confidence isn't very high because multiple powershell and cmd instances might warrant closer monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activities such as process creation, image loading, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few lines show powershell.exe loading images like MpClient.dll and then creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but I don't have enough context yet.\n\nNext, there are events where Registry values are being set by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. This adds some concern.\n\nThen, I see several process creation events for whoami.exe and multiple Process Create tasks with complex command lines in PowerShell. The command lines check if certain .bat files exist and exit based on that. This behavior seems like a script checking its environment—maybe trying to avoid detection or ensuring it has the necessary components before executing.\n\nLooking further, there are several Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe instances. I'm not exactly sure what these mean, but they might relate to PowerShell cmdlets being used, possibly for interacting with system services or modules.\n\nThroughout the logs, powershell.exe is accessed multiple times and interacts with various files and registry entries. This repeated activity by the same process could indicate a script running multiple commands, which isn't necessarily malicious but could be suspicious depending on context.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these activities are common or unusual. Using PowerShell for script execution is normal in many environments, especially for legitimate administrative tasks. However, the fact that the scripts check for specific files and exit if they don't find them might suggest some form of file-based persistence or payload delivery.\n\nThe batch shows a lot of activity from powershell.exe across multiple events, which could indicate a prolonged session or script execution. This kind of behavior can be hard to pinpoint without more context, like user permissions or the source of these commands.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because it involves repeated and varied actions by PowerShell, including registry modifications and file checks, which could be signs of malicious activity. However, there's also a chance that this is legitimate administrative work or system scripts.\n\nI'm not 100% certain without more context, so my confidence is around 0.7. There are enough red flags to warrant investigation, but it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including file creation, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses, suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are a lot here, all in JSONL format. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. So, any unusual activity with it should be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events:\n1. The first few entries are about image loading in powershell.exe. They're referencing various .NET and Windows Defender files. Those seem normal as part of Powershell's operation.\n2. Then there's an event where a file is created and immediately deleted. Specifically, it creates a PowerShell script test file and then deletes it. This could be an attempt to check if certain scripts are allowed or to erase evidence after some malicious activity. That seems suspicious.\n3. There are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome can do this for updates or extensions, doing this many times might be worth looking into, but since it's a single application doing repetitive actions, maybe not as concerning unless it's part of something else.\n4. Some Pipe Created events in Powershell, which could indicate communication between different processes or modules. This is a bit vague but could be malicious if the pipe is for command and control.\n5. The command line entries are interesting. They're using Powershell to check if certain files exist. If an attacker is trying to see if their malicious script exists before executing something, that's concerning. It looks like they're testing whether specific files are present in different locations, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or checking if the environment is set up for an attack.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are multiple signs that might indicate malicious behavior:\n- The creation and deletion of temporary script files.\n- Multiple registry modifications from Chrome, but more concerning are those from Powershell.\n- The repeated file checks via command line in Powershell could be a precursor to deploying malware or ensuring the environment is ready for an attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch shows activities that are unusual and potentially malicious. The confidence level is high because there are several red flags pointing towards possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious powershell.exe activities such as file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated image loads, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of JSONL events and wants me to classify the entire batch as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" They want only one result in a specific JSON format.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. Most events involve powershell.exe processes. The first event shows powershell.exe creating and modifying files using New-Item and Set-Content commands. These are typical PowerShell commands but can be malicious if the paths or content are suspicious.\n\nLooking at subsequent events, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing different registry keys and loading various DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell as it uses .NET frameworks, so these might not be red flags on their own.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of New-Item and Set-Content to create batch files with \"dir\" content seems concerning. Creating multiple batch files that execute directory listings could indicate a script trying to map out the file system, which is often part of early stages of an attack, like reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\nThe event tasks include Process Create, Registry access, Image Load, and Provider Lifecycle. The process creations and registry writes are common but need context. The fact that these events happen in quick succession and target various directories might suggest automated behavior, possibly from a script.\n\nI also notice the paths used in the commands. They're navigating up directories with \"..\" which can be risky as it allows writing to parent directories if permissions aren't properly set. This could be an attempt to place files in unintended locations, potentially for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might look benign, the combination of multiple file creations, registry changes, and repeated directory listings across different paths raises suspicions. This behavior doesn't align with typical user activity and could indicate malicious intent, such as establishing a foothold or deploying malware components.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to these red flags, but not 100% certain without more context. So, I'll set the confidence at 0.9.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe creating and modifying files through command-line arguments, which could indicate suspicious activity such as script execution or file manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of these events involve PowerShell executions. Each command line seems to check if a specific script file exists using `Test-Path` and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. The paths vary but follow a pattern like \"C:\\[somefolder]...\\*.bat\". This repeated checking could be part of a script execution flow, perhaps ensuring necessary files are present before proceeding.\n\nNotably, one event shows a file creation in the user's Temp directory for `__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`, followed immediately by its deletion. This is unusual because creating and then deleting a file without it being part of a cleanup routine might indicate something malicious, like testing script execution or trying to bypass certain security policies.\n\nAnother event involves registry value setting in PowerShell, which can be a red flag as attackers often use registry modifications for persistence or other malicious activities. Additionally, the repeated `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` tasks in PowerShell could suggest that scripts are being loaded or unloaded multiple times, possibly indicating script-based attacks or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the file paths, especially the ones under \"modulo_secundario\", \"registro_logico\", etc., these don't seem to be standard Windows directories. Custom or non-standard directories often signify user-installed software or potentially malicious scripts trying to hide their presence.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific files, the temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications—it's highly suggestive of malicious activity. The events collectively indicate potential script execution attempts, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions checking for file existence, creation and deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, and repeated checks on non-standard paths suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are all related to process creations and file operations involving PowerShell and other executables like cmd.exe and whoami.exe. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual activity here could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: there's an Image loaded from MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll located under Windows Defender directories. Those files are part of Microsoft's security products, so their loading might not be suspicious on its own unless they're being used in an unexpected way.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where PowerShell is creating temporary files, like the one with the path ending in .ssp.ps1. Temporary scripts can be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often use them to execute code that isn't directly run from the command line. The fact that these files are created and then deleted quickly (as seen in later entries) raises my concern—it might indicate an attempt to hide evidence or perform some unauthorized action.\n\nI also see that PowerShell is accessing various files and registry values, which could be part of legitimate operations but might also signal reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms. For example, checking for the existence of certain executables could be a way for malware to determine if it's on a system where specific tools are present.\n\nThe use of cmd.exe with an IF EXIST statement suggests some automated checks. While this can be benign, in the context of multiple process creations and file operations, it might indicate that an attacker is verifying files or trying to execute certain commands only under specific conditions, which could be part of a larger malicious script.\n\nAnother point is the repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell. This indicates that other processes are accessing it, which could mean privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement within a network if these accesses aren't legitimate.\n\nThe creation of temporary files in different user directories (like AppData) and the fact that some of them are deleted shortly after being created further supports the idea that this activity is trying to avoid detection. Malicious actors often clean up their tracks by deleting temporary files or logs to prevent forensic analysis.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination suggests a potential malicious script or process running in the background. The repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious file operations and registry manipulations, coupled with attempts to access other processes, points towards activity that could be indicative of an attack. Therefore, this batch is likely relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe loading modules and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what they're indicating.\n\nThe first event shows the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's a common system utility used to display user information, so it's usually benign unless there's something suspicious about how it's run. But in this case, the command line looks normal: just running whoami without any extra arguments. So I don't think this is concerning.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines here look like they're checking the existence of certain files. For example, \"if (Test-Path 'C:\\somepath\\file.exe') {exit 0} else {exit 1}\". This seems to be a script checking if specific files exist in various directories.\n\nI should consider why someone would run such checks repeatedly. One possibility is that an attacker is verifying the presence of certain tools or malware components on the system. If those files aren't present, they might proceed with deploying them. Alternatively, it could be part of some automated process, like ensuring required scripts exist before running other tasks.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events happen in quick succession and target different sensitive locations, that raises suspicion. The repetition across multiple paths suggests a systematic check, which is more than just casual script execution.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where powershell.exe sets a registry value. That's another red flag because attackers often use registry modifications to maintain persistence or change system configurations. However, without knowing the exact key being modified, it's hard to say definitively, but coupled with the other activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe image load events show Powershell loading various .NET framework components. This is normal for Powershell scripts that require .NET functionality. But again, combined with the file checks and registry access, it contributes to a concerning pattern.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing different parts of the filesystem in a structured way, setting a registry value, and loading expected libraries—it seems like this could be part of an attack chain. The repeated checks for specific files might indicate that the attacker is ensuring their malicious payload isn't already present before deploying it, which would make the batch of events worthy of investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not raise alarms, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence level is around 0.8 because there's enough concerning behavior to warrant closer inspection but without definitive proof of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes checking for specific files across various directories, combined with registry access and image loading activities, suggest potential malicious behavior or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

This seems like a script trying to verify file presence, which could be part of legitimate scripting or a prelude to malicious actions.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with similar command structures is concerning because attackers often use such tools for lateral movement and persistence. The tasks relate to process creation and registry access, which are common in attack chains.\n\nWhile some events might not indicate immediate compromise, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity, especially since the script checks multiple files across different paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key contains details about the process executed, like the command line arguments if available. The winlog key indicates the type of log event, such as 'Engine Lifecycle' or 'File created'. The file key provides information about any files involved in the event.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: powershell.exe with a specific command line that creates and sets content in two .bat files.\n- Winlog: Engine Lifecycle\n- File: None\n\nThis suggests PowerShell is being used to create batch files, which might be part of script execution. The command lines are using New-Item and Set-Content, which are common PowerShell cmdlets for file manipulation.\n\nThe second event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File: Path points to a temporary .ps1 file in the user's AppData directory.\n\nThis is normal as PowerShell often creates temporary files when executing scripts. However, the naming of the file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" seems generic but could be part of script validation or testing.\n\nThird event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog: File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\n- File: Same path as above, indicating the temporary file was deleted after creation.\n\nThis is a bit concerning. Why would a PowerShell process create and then immediately delete a file? It could be an attempt to clean up evidence of malicious activity or part of legitimate script execution. But it's worth noting because deleting files can sometimes indicate hiding behavior.\n\nFourth event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog: Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\n- File: None\n\nCreating pipes in PowerShell is common for inter-process communication, but it could also be used for command injection or lateral movement. I'll keep this in mind as a potential indicator of malicious activity.\n\nFifth event:\n- Similar to the first, with another PowerShell command creating and setting content in .bat files in different directories.\n\nThe same pattern repeats here, which might suggest multiple script executions targeting various locations. This could be part of a larger script deployment or a malicious payload trying to establish persistence in multiple places.\n\nSixth to ninth events:\n- These are Image loaded events for various DLLs, including MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Loading these is normal and doesn't raise red flags immediately. However, if the process loading them is suspicious, it could be concerning, but here it's PowerShell which is legitimate.\n\nTenth event:\n- Process: conhost.exe with a Registry value set. Conhost.exe is often used by scripts to host console windows. It's commonly associated with malicious activities because it can hide command-line processes or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nEleventh to fourteenth events:\n- More Registry value sets and Image loaded events for various DLLs, all from powershell.exe. These are standard operations but could be part of setting up a persistent backdoor if the registry modifications are in sensitive areas like Run keys.\n\nFifteenth event:\n- Process creation with a command line that checks if a specific .bat file exists and exits based on its presence. This suggests some form of persistence or checking mechanism, possibly to ensure malicious scripts are not already present before execution.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell to create and delete files, especially in different directories, could indicate script execution or file manipulation activities. The creation and deletion of temporary files might be part of a larger payload deployment or an attempt to leave no trace after executing malicious commands. Additionally, the registry modifications by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe are concerning because they can be used for persistence.\n\nThe use of multiple .bat files in various directories (modulo_base, entrada_temporario, etc.) might suggest that the script is attempting to establish a presence across different parts of the filesystem, possibly to ensure execution on subsequent reboots or to spread components as part of a larger attack. The command lines are obfuscated with escaped quotes and paths, which could be an attempt to hide the true destination or purpose of the files.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated registry writes by PowerShell and conhost.exe might indicate attempts to create persistent keys for malicious processes. Registry persistence is a common technique used by malware to ensure it starts up after system reboots.\n\nThe confidence level here is high because while individual events could be part of legitimate script execution, the combination—especially the file creation\/deletion pattern, multiple .bat files in different locations, and registry modifications—points towards potentially malicious activity. Additionally, the involvement of conhost.exe adds to the suspicion as it's often a red flag in security contexts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate file manipulation and registry changes, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I see multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence. There are several instances where Powershell is being executed with commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem, which could indicate a directory listing across the system. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion actions in a temporary directory, suggesting script execution. The repeated use of the same command line parameters might be an attempt to avoid detection or test for policy enforcement. There's also activity involving registry modifications and loading .NET framework components, which can be signs of malicious scripts trying to elevate privileges or establish persistence. Considering all these activities together, it seems like there could be potential malicious behavior. However, without clear indicators of compromise, the confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell processes. This is common because scripts often run through PowerShell. But looking closer, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is checking for specific script files, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. That's a red flag because such scripts could be used maliciously to capture keystrokes.\n\nAlso, I see events where temporary files are being created and then deleted quickly. For example, the file __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior can indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies by creating a new script each time, which might be part of a persistence mechanism or malicious activity.\n\nThe events involve multiple paths with varying directory structures, suggesting that the attacker might be trying different locations to check if their payload exists. This could mean they're attempting to establish persistence across different directories, making it harder to detect.\n\nFurthermore, some tasks are related to registry value sets and process access, which can allow an attacker to modify system configurations or gain unauthorized access. The repeated use of PowerShell without clear legitimate reason raises suspicion, especially in a batch where such activities are chained together.\n\nI'm also noticing the involvement of different files loaded by PowerShell, including .NET framework components and Windows Defender-related DLLs. While this might seem normal, it could be part of obfuscation techniques to make malicious activities appear benign or to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific scripts, quick file creation and deletion, varying directory accesses, and potential registry modifications points towards possible malicious behavior. These actions are not typical of everyday user activity and could indicate an ongoing attack or attempted breach.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for specific script files across various paths, along with temporary file creation\/deletion patterns, suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or keystroke logging attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so it's a red flag. The tasks include Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed, and more. These actions alone could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of these events, I see that powershell is being executed with specific paths checked using Test-Path. This might indicate a script checking if certain files exist before proceeding. If those files aren't there, it exits; otherwise, maybe something malicious happens. This kind of behavior can be a sign of a potential attack.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was run. That's often used by attackers to check the current user or permissions, which could be part of an initial access phase.\n\nThe files being accessed vary, but some are temporary files in users' AppData folders. Temporary files can be used for malicious scripts that don't persist long on disk, making them harder to detect.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines checking various paths. This could suggest an attempt to locate specific files across multiple directories, possibly looking for a payload or configuration data.\n\nThe MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are related to Windows Defender, so maybe the attacker is trying to bypass or interfere with antivirus measures by loading those modules.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: powershell script execution with file checks, creation\/deletion of files in temp folders, registry access, process access, and use of whoami. These are common tactics in cyberattacks for persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence is high because while some events on their own might not be conclusive, the combination suggests a coordinated effort that could indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command lines, file operations in temporary directories, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe performing tasks like file creation and registry modifications. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so some activity isn't unusual, but certain commands might raise flags. However, these seem to be standard operations—like accessing the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed twice. Whoami is a common tool for users to check their permissions or privileges. Unless it's used in an unexpected way, this doesn't immediately look suspicious.\n\nNotepad.exe modifying a registry value caught my attention. Notepad is a benign application, but why would it be making registry changes? That could indicate potential tampering or malicious activity. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nSVCHOST.exe is running multiple times and setting registry values. SVCHOST is known to run legitimate system services, but it's also often used by malware because of its legitimate appearance. However, seeing it perform registry modifications isn't necessarily suspicious unless there are other indicators.\n\nThe Calculator.exe event loads urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL for handling URLs in Windows. That seems normal and not concerning on its own.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file looks like it's part of the data collection process, so nothing unusual there.\n\nMultiple instances of chrome.exe making network connections are expected if someone is browsing the internet. However, seeing several network connections from svchost.exe could be worth looking into as it might indicate something more malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, I notice a pattern where powershell.exe and notepad.exe perform actions that, while not overtly malicious, could be part of an attacker's toolkit. The use of whoami and multiple svchost.exe processes accessing network resources adds some concern. While individually these events aren't alarming, the combination—especially the repeated powershell activities and registry modifications—could indicate potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it has a mix of normal and potentially suspicious actions that together might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell.exe events, including file creation and registry modifications, which could indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, there are instances of whoami.exe execution and unusual Notepad.exe activity, along with network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe that may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nThe first few entries show PowerShell processes with command lines that include commands like `ls -recurse`, which list files recursively. This could be part of normal system administration or it might be malicious, depending on context.\n\nI notice multiple events where the same PowerShell command is run, which might indicate scripting or automated behavior. There's also an event showing a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log shipping and probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother point is that there are several registry writes from both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware, so this could raise flags. Additionally, the repeated attempts to access files or create new ones might indicate data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell executions with file and registry interactions is concerning. While some activities are common in legitimate scripts, the frequency and variety might suggest something more malicious.
