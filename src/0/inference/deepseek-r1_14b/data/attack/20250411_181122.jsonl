{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from chrome.exe performing registry value sets and DNS queries. These are common activities for a web browser, so that doesn't raise red flags immediately. Chrome often interacts with the registry and makes network requests, especially when dealing with extensions or plugins.\n\nThere's also an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this is expected behavior. It's generating logs correctly, nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The filename doesn't seem malicious at first glance, but the combination of using powershell to create a file could be indicative of malicious activity. However, without more context about what's inside the file or other related events, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nLooking through all the events, most are normal user activities from chrome.exe and legitimate system processes. The only potentially concerning point is the powershell.exe creating a file. But since this is just one event among many standard ones, it might not be enough on its own to warrant an investigation unless there's additional suspicious behavior linked to it.\n\nConsidering all events together, while there are some red flags like using powershell, they aren't strong indicators of malicious activity without more context. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activities such as browser operations and legitimate system processes. The use of powershell.exe to create a file could be suspicious, but without additional context or malicious indicators, it's not conclusive.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell process with a command line that uses findstr and select-string looking for the word 'password'. That seems suspicious because those commands are often used in scripts to search for sensitive information. This could be part of an attack trying to gather credentials.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably normal if it's part of logging setup, so nothing too concerning here.\n\nNotepad setting a registry value is also not unusual unless there's something specific about the key being modified.\n\nAnother PowerShell process accessing something—maybe monitoring its behavior with other events could be important.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds normal. Calc is often used as a benign example, and urlmon is a legitimate system file.\n\nPowershell again loading a Defender-related DLL might be part of standard operations or maybe trying to hide activity by using legitimate processes.\n\nAnother occurrence of the suspicious PowerShell command line—this repetition could indicate persistence or multiple attempts at searching for passwords. Definitely something to look into.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying registry—svchost can host various services, but repeated registry writes might not be normal and could be part of malicious activity.\n\nSame with other svchost, Calculator, conhost, and ApplicationFrameHost setting registry values—they don't seem inherently bad, but in combination with other events, especially the PowerShell ones, it's a red flag.\n\nChrome making pipe and registry changes seems standard unless there's an unusual pattern. No issues spotted here.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of suspicious PowerShell commands stands out. It suggests potential malicious activity like credential harvesting. The consistency across multiple entries increases my confidence that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities and registry modifications indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of logs from different processes, mainly involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe.\n\nFirst off, I see that there's an event where whoami.exe was executed. That's usually a benign process because it just outputs the user information. Nothing malicious on its own, but it's good to note since sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools for reconnaissance.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is powerful and often used by both admins and attackers. The command lines in these events stand out: they're using findstr with some patterns like \"pass\" across various file extensions. That makes me think the script is searching for sensitive information, possibly passwords or credentials.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with powershell.exe, there are process creations, registry accesses, image loads, and file operations. The creation of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1) and then deleting it immediately could be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might indicate that powershell is being used in a way that interacts deeply with system services.\n\nThe registry writes are another red flag because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The file creation and deletion, coupled with the command-line patterns targeting password-related information, suggest potential data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch of events shows signs of suspicious activity. Powershell is known for its versatility in both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The combination of searching for sensitive terms, creating\/deleting temp files, registry modifications, and multiple process creations points towards possible malicious behavior, like credential dumping or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information (passwords) in various file types, combined with registry access and file creation\/deletion activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe** creating a file: This seems normal as it's likely part of the logging process itself.\n2. **powershell.exe** creating a file named 'estrutura_ativo.txt': PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be suspicious.\n3. A null event with no process\/file info: Doesn't provide useful data but might not raise flags alone.\n4. Again, **winlogbeat.exe** creating the same file path as before: Consistent logging activity, probably normal.\n5. **powershell.exe** accessing a process: Could be legitimate scripting, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n6. **whoami.exe** being run from system32: This is standard for user identification and shouldn't be alarming on its own.\n7. Another **powershell.exe** access: Again, PowerShell is versatile; could be either benign or malicious.\n8. **powershell.exe** modifying the registry: Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n9. **cmd.exe** deleting scheduled tasks: Using command-line tools to delete tasks might be part of a cleanup routine after malicious activity.\n10. More **schtasks.exe** deletions and loading taskschd.dll: Deleting tasks and loading known DLLs could be normal admin work but also possible signs of removing traces of malware.\n11. **svchost.exe** modifying the registry:_svchost is a legitimate process, but it can sometimes be used by malware to hide activities.\n12. Multiple instances of **powershell.exe**, **cmd.exe**, and others performing various actions: The repetition raises concern about potential automated or malicious scripts running.\n\nConsidering all these events together:\n\n- There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and modifying the registry, which can be red flags for potential malicious activity.\n- cmd.exe is deleting scheduled tasks, which could indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous actions or disrupt system monitoring.\n- The use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks suggests someone is managing scheduled tasks, possibly trying to maintain persistence or cover their tracks.\n\nThe combination of these activities—especially the repeated and varied attempts to access processes, modify the registry, and manipulate scheduled tasks—indicates a potential security incident.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial events show processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. I notice that cmd.exe is used with commands like wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete. That's a red flag because using WMIC to delete processes can be indicative of malicious activity—maybe trying to hide traces.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and creating processes. PowerShell is commonly abused by attackers for its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could mean the attacker is attempting to modify system configurations or create persistence points.\n\nLooking further, I see whoami.exe being run. While legitimate, it's often used in reconnaissance to gather user information, which could be part of an attack chain. Additionally, processes like net.exe and net1.exe with command-line arguments deleting users (like \"componente_comum_Admin\" and \"tarefa_temporario_Admin\") are concerning. These look like attempts to remove user accounts, possibly to erase evidence or gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe events also show cmd.exe being used to delete specific user accounts, which is another malicious sign. Attackers might try to cover their tracks by deleting logs or user profiles after breaching a system.\n\nOverall, the combination of using WMIC and PowerShell for process deletion, registry modifications, account deletions, and repeated use of these tools suggests a coordinated attack. These activities are typical in post-exploitation phases where attackers seek to maintain access, escalate privileges, and cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations, registry modifications, and file deletions indicative of potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that PowerShell.exe was accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye out if there are other suspicious actions around this process.\n\nNext, there are several events related to User Account Management and Security Group Management without any associated files or processes. These could be normal admin activity, like adding or removing users from groups. But since these are multiple in a row, it's something to note but not necessarily alarming yet.\n\nThen I see an event where cmd.exe is used with the command \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". This looks like someone deleting a user account using the command prompt. Similarly, there are other net.exe and net1.exe commands deleting users. Deleting accounts isn't inherently bad, but if these accounts were recently created or have unusual names, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process creating whoami.exe, which is typically used to check user information. This seems normal unless it's part of a larger script meant to gather info for an attack.\n\nThere are several Registry value set events across different processes like PowerShell.exe and services.exe. These could be legitimate configurations, but they can also be signs of malware installing or modifying system settings.\n\nAlso, the use of sc.exe to delete a service (sc delete win32times) caught my attention. Deleting services can disrupt normal operations, so it's worth investigating why that particular service is being removed.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple instances where users are being deleted using command-line tools and several registry modifications. While some of these could be part of legitimate system administration tasks, the combination—especially the repeated deletions and registry changes—is concerning. It raises the possibility of account manipulation or persistence mechanisms being set up by an attacker.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple red flags, even if individually they might not be alarming. The cumulative effect suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including user deletions and registry modifications across various processes suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **whoami.exe execution**: The first event shows whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool used to check user information. Not inherently suspicious unless there are other indicators.\n\n2. **powershell.exe accessed**: Next, powershell.exe is accessed. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious since it's powerful. Alone, this isn't concerning, but repeated accesses could raise flags.\n\n3. **Registry value set in PowerShell**: Then, there's a registry access event where a value is set. This might indicate configuration changes, which could be part of legitimate operations or attempts to hide malicious activities.\n\n4. **cmd.exe deleting files**: An cmd.exe process deletes two specific files from the Temp directory. The file names have 'calc' in them, which reminds me that sometimes malware uses benign-sounding processes (like calc) for their activities. Deleting such files might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove temporary malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Multiple Registry accesses**: There are multiple events where various processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe) set registry values. This could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on each boot or maintain certain configurations.\n\n6. **Provider and Engine Lifecycle events for PowerShell**: Several entries show 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in PowerShell. These are typical when starting a new PowerShell instance, but the repetition might suggest something unusual, like multiple shells being spun up quickly.\n\n7. **Image loaded events**: Powershell loads various .NET files, which is normal if it's running scripts that require those libraries. However, combined with other activities, this could be part of a larger malicious process.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple invocations of PowerShell and cmd.exe performing file deletions, registry modifications, and loading system libraries. These actions are common in attack chains—often used for persistence, lateral movement, or to clean up traces after executing malicious code.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with unusual command lines (like \"& {}\") might indicate an attempt to hide commands or execute them in a way that's harder to detect. The file deletions and registry changes could be part of an attacker's cleanup process to remove evidence or to prepare the system for further actions.\n\nWhile each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, the combination suggests a potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, including registry modifications, file deletions, and unusual command lines, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries related to powershell.exe. That's already something to keep an eye on because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first few logs show that powershell.exe is loading images like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These are standard .NET framework components, so that doesn't seem suspicious by itself.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 in the Temp directory. Powershell scripts being created can be part of normal operations, especially during testing or configuration tasks. However, it's also a common tactic for malware to create temporary files to execute malicious code.\n\nNext, I see that this file is deleted shortly after being created. This could indicate an attempt to remove evidence, which raises my concern level. Malicious actors often clean up their tracks to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where powershell.exe accesses other processes and creates pipes. Pipe Created events can be part of inter-process communication, but in the context of malicious activities, they might be used for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThere's also a process creation event for whoami.exe. This is a common system utility used to determine user information, which could be legitimate. However, when combined with powershell.exe activity, it might suggest an elevation of privilege check or user enumeration as part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. This seems unrelated to the powershell.exe activities and might just be log shipping software running normally.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file creation\/deletion, process access, and pipe creation stands out. These actions could be indicative of script testing, which is often done by attackers to ensure their payload works without raising alarms. The deletion of the created file might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces behind.\n\nWhile I can't confirm malicious intent from this log alone, the combination of these activities suggests potential suspicious behavior that merits further investigation. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events including file creation\/deletion, pipe creation, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity or script testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze and determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. The user is asking me to look at the entire batch as a whole and provide just one classification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. **whoami.exe** being executed. That seems normal; it's often used to check user information.\n2. Powershell.exe accessed multiple times. Hmm, that catches my attention because PowerShell can be a red flag for malicious activities, but it's also commonly used for legitimate tasks like scripting and system admin work.\n3. There are several entries where powershell.exe is being accessed. I'll note the frequency here.\n4. RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own; Windows services often do this.\n5. Notepad.exe modifying registry—another common process, not a red flag immediately.\n6. Powershell.exe again in another entry, so that's consistent with earlier points.\n7. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that's odd. Calculator shouldn't be accessing such system files. Malware might inject code into legitimate processes like calc.exe to hide its tracks. Also, urlmon.dll is related to URL handling and can indicate malicious activity if used unexpectedly.\n8. Svchost.exe modifying registry again—svchost is a known process for running services, but unusual activity here could be suspicious.\n9. Winlogbeat.exe creating files—it's likely an agent for log management, so that should be okay unless it's doing something unexpected.\n10. More powershell accesses and another calc.exe event with urlmon.dll. This repetition of using non-standard processes like calc.exe to load DLLs raises the suspicion level.\n11. ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe again modifying registry—again, not inherently bad but could be part of a larger pattern.\n12. Chrome.exe events: multiple DNS queries and network connections. While this can be normal browsing behavior, it might also indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity if the domains are suspicious.\n\nNow, considering all these together, I'm looking for patterns that might suggest malicious behavior. The repeated use of powershell.exe is a big red flag because attackers often use it to execute scripts and commands. Also, the calc.exe loading urlmon.dll stands out—malware frequently uses legitimate processes to hide their activities. Multiple registry modifications by different processes could indicate an attempt to persistence or configuration changes that are part of an attack.\n\nThe network activity from Chrome might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it adds up. It's possible the attacker is using multiple avenues—executing scripts, hiding in legitimate processes, and possibly communicating over the network.\n\nI should also consider the context—if this system is known for running these applications normally, some of these might just be part of standard operations. But given the frequency and combination, especially the unusual use of calc.exe with urlmon.dll, it's more likely than not that there's something malicious going on.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple suspicious processes being accessed or modified in a way that suggests potential unauthorized activity. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and unusual process activity involving calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
