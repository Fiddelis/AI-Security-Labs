{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities like executing scripts and hiding processes. But I should look at the specific actions to assess the risk.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and creating files in temporary directories. For example, there's a file creation event for '__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1' which was later deleted. This seems suspicious because scripts created and immediately deleted could be part of an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell.exe instances are running Compress-Archive commands with various paths. These commands might be legitimate for compressing files, but the specific paths mentioned look unusual. They include things like \"modulo_temporario\", \"objeto_principal\", and other terms that don't immediately ring a bell as standard system folders.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve creating temporary ZIP files in different locations could indicate data exfiltration or malicious compression activities. The repetitive use of similar command structures might suggest automated or script-based behavior, which is often seen in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load tasks loading various DLLs and modules related to .NET framework and Windows Defender. While these can be legitimate, the combination with other suspicious actions could imply that the process is attempting to hide or load malicious components.\n\nThe events also show a lot of process creation and access events for powershell.exe, which is concerning because attackers often abuse PowerShell for command execution and persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, while some individual events might not be outright malicious, the pattern—multiple powershell executions, file creations\/deletions in temp directories, repetitive Compress-Archive commands with non-standard paths—raises red flags. This behavior doesn't align with typical user activity and could indicate a potential attack or unauthorized access.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because of these patterns, but I'm not 100% certain without further investigation. There's a high probability that something malicious is happening here.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: Interesting**\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n- **Multiple PowerShell Instances:** Numerous events show powershell.exe being accessed or created, which is often used in malicious activities.\n- **File Creation and Deletion:** A script file was created and immediately deleted, possibly to avoid detection.\n- **Suspicious Compress-Archive Commands:** Repetitive use of these commands with non-standard paths could indicate data exfiltration or malicious compression.\n- **Image Loads and Modules:** Loading various DLLs might be an attempt to hide or load malicious components.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe patterns observed suggest potential malicious activity, making this batch of logs值得关注 (worthy of attention). Further investigation is recommended to confirm the nature of these activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loading a file into memory. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but I'll keep an eye out for suspicious paths or actions.\n\nSecond and third events: More PowerShell commands compressing files using Compress-Archive. The destination paths are in the TEMP directory, which is standard for temporary files. But why so many compressed files? Maybe it's part of a script doing multiple tasks.\n\nFourth event: Another powershell.exe command with a different path. Still, seems like a script is running, maybe installing something or moving files around.\n\nFifth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's the agent itself logging, nothing unusual here.\n\nSixth and seventh events: Powershell again accessing registries. Registry access is common in scripts for configuration, but could also be part of persistence mechanisms. I need to check if these writes are legitimate or trying to hide something.\n\nEighth event: conhost.exe accessing registry. Conhost is usually a legitimate Windows process. But why is it accessing the registry? Maybe it's part of standard operations.\n\nNinth and tenth events: More powershell.exe with Compress-Archive, same pattern as before. The destination paths vary, but all are in TEMP. Could be a sign of packing multiple components for execution or exfiltration.\n\nEleventh to fourteenth events: Various processes like RuntimeBroker, notepad, calc, svchost accessing registries or loading images. These seem normal except if there's an unusual combination.\n\nFifteenth event: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL for URL handling; no red flags here.\n\nSixteenth to twentieth events: More svchost and other processes doing registry writes or creating pipes. This is typical Windows background activity, especially with services like chrome which often interact with the registry for settings.\n\nLooking overall, there's a lot of powershell.exe activity, especially using Compress-Archive. While not inherently malicious, the frequency might indicate something suspicious, like a script downloading multiple components. The registry accesses by powershell could be setting up persistence or modifying system configurations in a way that's not typical user activity.\n\nI'm also noticing that some files being accessed, like urlmon.dll, are legitimate Windows files, but their access by certain processes (like Calculator.exe) might warrant closer look if they're accessing them outside of usual contexts.\n\nIn summary, the powershell activities with Compress-Archive and multiple registry writes could be signs of malicious behavior. It's possible that an attacker is using these scripts to drop files, establish persistence, or move laterally within a network. The volume of such events suggests a potential compromise rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Final Answer**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Powershell.exe loading a file. Common for scripts but should be monitored.\n   - **Events 2-4:** Multiple Compress-Archive commands by powershell.exe, targeting TEMP directory, indicating potential file operations.\n   - **Event 5:** winlogbeat creating files; normal logging activity.\n   - **Events 6-8:** Powershell accessing registry and conhost.exe. Registry access can be malicious for persistence.\n   - **Events 9-10:** More powershell commands and other processes interacting with registries or pipes, suggesting possible hidden activities.\n   - **Event 15:** Calculator.exe loading a standard DLL; likely benign but worth noting if behavior is out of place.\n   - **Events 16-20:** Background processes performing typical operations, no immediate red flags.\n\n2. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - Significant powershell.exe activity with Compress-Archive and registry modifications.\n   - Multiple temporary files created by scripts, which could be part of malicious payload delivery or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Assess Potential Risks:**\n   - Powershell is a common tool for attackers due to its legitimate use and scripting capabilities.\n   - Frequent file compression in TEMP suggests possible package dropping or malicious script execution.\n   - Registry writes by scripts may indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes to hide activities.\n\n4. **Determine the Nature of Activity:**\n   - The combination of powershell commands, registry modifications, and temporary files points towards potential malicious activity such as script-based attacks, lateral movement, or persistence setup.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a high level of suspicious activity, particularly involving multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations and accessing the Windows Registry. These actions are consistent with potential malicious behavior, such as script execution for payload delivery, establishing persistence mechanisms, or data manipulation. The volume and nature of these activities suggest a possible cybersecurity incident requiring further investigation to determine if a compromise has occurred.\n\n**Answer:** The events indicate suspicious activity potentially indicative of a cybersecurity threat due to powershell.exe's involvement in file compression, registry modifications, and other actions that could be part of malicious scripts or attacks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe where the task is \"Registry value set\". That seems a bit odd because Chrome usually doesn't change registry values that often unless it's installing an extension or update. But seeing this repeated so many times makes me think maybe something malicious is trying to modify system settings in bulk.\n\nThen, another event from chrome.exe shows an image load for amsi.dll, which is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That could be normal if Chrome is interacting with antivirus features, but sometimes attackers might try to disable or manipulate this to avoid detection. Also, the other file path points to MpOAV.dll, part of Windows Defender, so maybe there's some interaction there that's suspicious.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file. That seems normal if it's just setting up its data directory, but I should check if this is part of the legitimate process or if it's being used for something else, like logging sensitive information.\n\nThere are two events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool often misused by attackers. The fact that it's accessing different processes could indicate command execution or lateral movement within the system. This definitely raises a red flag because malicious actors commonly use PowerShell for such activities.\n\nLastly, there's a whoami.exe process being executed with no arguments, which seems straightforward since it's used to determine user information. But in this context, if it's part of a larger sequence of actions by another process (like powershell), it might be trying to gather system credentials or privileges.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated registry modifications by Chrome, interaction with antivirus components, configuration file creation, and multiple PowerShell accesses. These could indicate potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or attempts to disable security features. The combination suggests a possible attack vector rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, loading antivirus components, configuration file creation, and PowerShell process accesses which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
