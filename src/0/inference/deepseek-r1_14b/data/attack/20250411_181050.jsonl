{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line represents an event with process info, Windows log task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from cmd.exe and powershell.exe. There are commands like using certutil to encode and decode files. That's a red flag because certutil is often used in malicious scripts to execute code. The command lines have paths pointing to calc.exe being encoded and decoded into different temp files. That seems suspiciousâ€”why would someone be encoding system32 files?\n\nThen there are several process creations for cmd.exe and powershell.exe. These are common tools for attackers to hide their activities. The fact that they're being used with arguments like \"\/c\" suggests they're executing commands directly, which is typical in command-line attacks.\n\nLooking at the file events, I see a lot of temporary files being created and modified, especially in the C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. These could be temporary storage for malicious payloads before execution. The fact that some are named things like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" sounds like parts of a larger malicious script.\n\nThe registry modifications stand out too. Processes like whoami.exe and rundll32.exe accessing the registry might be trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. Registry events can indicate configuration changes, which attackers often use to ensure their malware sticks around after reboots.\n\nThere are also repeated file creations by powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which could be part of a script that's dropping files or creating temporary components for an attack. The names like \"componente_base_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe\" suggest they're building something from pieces.\n\nI also see multiple instances where chrome.exe is accessing the registry and making network connections. While chrome can be legitimate, repeated network activity could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server. The fact that there are four such events might warrant looking into whether this is normal browsing behavior or part of an attack.\n\nOn top of that, there's winlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory. This could be related to log monitoring tools, but it's also possible that an attacker is using this as a cover for their activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several signs of potential malicious activity: use of certutil for encoding\/decoding, multiple temporary file creations, registry modifications by various processes, and repeated network connections. These are classic indicators of compromise (IoCs) often seen in APTs or malware campaigns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including the use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files, numerous temporary file creations, registry modifications, and repeated network connections from chrome.exe. These indicate potential malicious behavior such as payload execution, persistence mechanisms, and possible data exfiltration.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe where the task is a Registry value set. These seem repetitive and could just be normal operations since Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings or extensions.\n\nNext, I see an entry from SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. That sounds legitimate as these are Windows system files being loaded by known processes.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. This seems like it's part of normal operation, perhaps during setup or configuration.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries are more concerning. There are two events where Registry value is set and another two where Process accessed occurs. Powershell can be used for legitimate admin tasks but is also commonly exploited by attackers. The combination of registry modifications and process access could indicate malicious activity like creating persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, considering the single instance and not seeing more suspicious actions immediately after, it's hard to be certain. But given the potential risks associated with powershell.exe events and their nature, there's a moderate concern here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and suspicious activity from Powershell.exe, such as Registry value set and Process access tasks, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
