{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event: notepad.exe setting a registry value. Not too suspicious on its own since many apps do that.\n\nSecond: powershell.exe accessed something. PowerShell is often used for scripting, which can be good or bad, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThird: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Hmm, Calculator accessing a system file? That seems odd. Could this be a sign of something malicious?\n\nFourth and fifth: svchost.exe setting registry values again. Svchost is a common process for services, so multiple entries aren't unusual, but combined with others might raise flags.\n\nSixth: Calculator again loading the same DLL. Now I'm thinking maybe there's a pattern hereâ€”maybe it's not just a coincidence.\n\nSeventh: powershell.exe accessed again. Multiple instances of PowerShell activity could indicate scripting or automation, which is often used in attacks.\n\nEighth: whoami.exe ran with a command line. Using whoami to gather system info can be part of reconnaissance, especially when combined with other scripts.\n\nNinth and tenth: More svchost registry writes and another powershell access. Accumulating these might suggest persistence or configuration changes by an attacker.\n\nEleventh: services.exe logon. Services are normal but could be related to malicious activity if combined with others.\n\nTwelfth: Special logon event without a process. This might indicate a system account or service logon, possibly part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple entries involve powershell and svchost, which are common in attacks. The repeated use of Calculator.exe accessing a system DLL is concerning. Additionally, the whoami.exe usage could be data gathering. Overall, this batch shows behaviors that might indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and svchost.exe, which are commonly associated with malicious activities. Notably, there are repeated instances of Registry value sets by svchost.exe and ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll by calc.exe and Calculator.exe, which could indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That's normal for a browser, so probably nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe instances. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first one sets a registry value, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of persistence mechanisms if done by unauthorized code.\n\nNext is a cmd.exe process that runs \"wmic process call create notepad.exe\". Wmic is often abused in attacks because it's a tool used for remote commands. Using wmic to create processes can indicate malicious activity since attackers might use it to spawn new processes or elevate privileges.\n\nThere are multiple WMIC.exe entries loading various DLLs, including ones from Windows Defender. This seems unusual because legitimate software typically doesn't load defender components via wmic in this way. It could be an attempt to hide or obfuscate malicious activities.\n\nAnother cmd.exe sets a registry value again, which is another red flag as attackers often modify the registry for persistence.\n\nConhost.exe is involved too; it's commonly used by malware to create hidden command-line windows, so that adds to the suspicion.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating files, which could be normal if it's part of log management, but considering the other suspicious activities, it might be worth investigating. Also, there are some events with \"None\" in process or file paths, which might indicate attempted obfuscation or failed operations.\n\nServices.exe and svchost.exe entries don't stand out as malicious on their own, but combined with the other events, they could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple use of wmic, powershell, cmd for creating processes, registry modifications, and hidden windows. These are common tactics in cyberattacks to maintain persistence and execute malicious commands. The combination suggests potential malicious activity that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including use of WMIC.exe for process creation, powershell.exe registry modifications, and cmd.exe command-line operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
