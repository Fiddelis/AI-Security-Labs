{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Each command line seems similar but has different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The actions involve executing calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. This immediately raises a red flag because creating persistent tasks with high-level access could be a sign of malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing the registry and creating processes. These might be part of setting up the scheduled tasks or could indicate attempts to hide or modify system configurations. Registry modifications can be common in attacks to establish persistence or alter security settings.\n\nAdditionally, there are Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While this isn't inherently suspicious on its own, when combined with other activities, it might suggest that the script is executing code that requires these libraries, possibly for obfuscation or malicious payload execution.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an event involving chrome.exe creating a pipe and accessing the registry. This could be normal activity since Chrome often interacts with system components. However, if this were part of a larger pattern of malicious behavior, it might warrant closer attention, but in isolation, it seems benign.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they form a narrative where powershell is being used to create multiple scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon. The use of BUILTIN\\Administrators group suggests an attempt to escalate privileges, which is a common tactic in attacks to maintain persistence and control. The repetition of similar commands with varying task names might indicate an effort to avoid detection by creating multiple instances.\n\nMoreover, the combination of registry accesses and image loads supports the idea that this could be part of a larger attack vector. The fact that all these events stem from powershell.exe usage is concerning because it's a tool often abused in cyberattacks for its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nI should also consider potential false positives. Could these activities be legitimate? For example, system administrators might use scheduled tasks for backups or other routine operations. However, the specific use of calc.exe as the action and the elevated privileges make it less likely to be benign. Legitimate scripts usually don't need such high-level access for simple tasks.\n\nIn summary, while some events could be innocent, the overall pattern points towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated creation of admin-level scheduled tasks with powershell, coupled with registry modifications and image loading, creates a concerning picture that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple events involve `powershell.exe`, which is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The command lines show the creation of scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTask` with actions executing `calc.exe`.\n   - Notably, these tasks are set to run at logon under the `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group, indicating an attempt to escalate privileges.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - The repetition of similar commands with different task names suggests a deliberate effort to create multiple persistence points, possibly to avoid detection or ensure long-term access.\n\n4. **Check for Registry and Image Activity:**\n   - Events show registry accesses and image loading by `powershell.exe`, which can be part of setting up malicious payloads or hiding processes.\n\n5. **Assess Context and Relevance:**\n   - While some activities (like Chrome's pipe creation) are benign, the cluster around powershell.exe raises concerns given its misuse potential.\n\n6. **Consider False Positives:**\n   - Although possible, legitimate use of such high-privilege tasks with calc.exe is rare, making it more likely malicious.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of suspicious activities points to potential attack indicators, necessitating further analysis and monitoring.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation:** Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with actions executing calc.exe at logon using admin privileges.\n2. **Registry and Image Activity:** Powershell accessing the registry and loading .NET components, which could be part of a payload execution or persistence mechanism.\n3. **Pattern of Behavior:** Repetitive creation of similar tasks suggests an attack vector aiming for persistence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe logs indicate potential malicious activity involving powershell.exe creating elevated scheduled tasks, making them **interesting from a cybersecurity perspective**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The first event shows powershell loading an image file, MpOAV.dll, which seems related to Windows Defender. That might not be suspicious on its own. Then there's a file being created and immediately deleted in the Temp folder with a random name. That's a bit concerning because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are two instances where powershell.exe is used to create scheduled tasks via command line. The commands set calc.exe to run at logon with highest privileges. This seems malicious because it's persistence technique—malware often creates scheduled tasks to ensure it runs on startup. Using BUILTIN\\Administrators suggests broad access, which could indicate privilege escalation.\n\nAlso, there are several registry writes by chrome.exe. While chrome can make registry changes for its settings, multiple such events might be unusual depending on the context. However, without more info, this isn't a clear red flag yet.\n\nThen, there's a series of 16 events with \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the task field and no process or file information. This is definitely suspicious because it indicates remote activity without legitimate context. Attackers often use remote commands to execute malicious code on the system.\n\nPutting this together: powershell being used for potentially harmful tasks, creation\/deletion of temp files, scheduled tasks setup with calc.exe, and numerous remote command executions. These activities collectively point towards possible malicious behavior. The confidence is high because multiple red flags are present across different event types.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activity, including creation of a temp file and deletion, scheduled task registration with calc.exe, and multiple remote command executions. These actions suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through them one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal since WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which often interacts with system files.\n\nNext, three events of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process for services, so these could be standard operations unless there's something unusual about the keys being modified. But nothing jumps out here immediately.\n\nThen, an event where svchost.exe creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. I'm not sure if that path is typical for svchost to create files. It might be worth looking into whether this file is legitimate or potentially malicious.\n\nMoving on, two events of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no process name. This could be concerning because remote command execution can be a sign of lateral movement in an attack. Without knowing the source, it's hard to say, but it's something to note.\n\nThere are multiple entries from powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The file paths here don't seem immediately suspicious, but repeated use might warrant closer inspection.\n\nConhost.exe setting a registry value—conhost is usually related to console windows. Not sure if that's unusual unless the specific key is known to be targeted in attacks.\n\nSeveral chrome.exe events loading images and interacting with Defender components. That seems normal as part of browser operations. The DNS query from chrome might just be standard browsing activity.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory—this could be part of log shipping, so probably benign unless it's unexpected behavior like unauthorized access.\n\nThe last two powershell.exe events create files named entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt. These names don't immediately raise red flags, but the naming might hint at some kind of data being stored, which could be malicious if those files contain exploit code or other malicious content.\n\nPutting it all together: there are a few red flags—remote command executions, file creation by svchost in an unusual location, and multiple powershell.exe activities. However, these could also be part of legitimate operations. The volume of registry modifications from chrome might just be normal, but it's worth keeping an eye on. Without more context, it's hard to definitively say there's malicious activity, but some of the events are noteworthy enough to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events does not indicate clear signs of a cybersecurity incident. While there are several activities that could be considered unusual or potentially suspicious, such as remote command executions and file creations by svchost.exe in non-typical locations, these could also be legitimate operations depending on the context. There's no conclusive evidence of malicious activity based on the provided logs alone. However, monitoring these events further and correlating them with other data points could provide more clarity."}
