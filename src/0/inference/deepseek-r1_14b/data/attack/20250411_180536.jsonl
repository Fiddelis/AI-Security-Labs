{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several processes loading images. For example, 'tarefa_logico.exe' loaded mscorlib.ni.dll, which is part of the .NET frameworkâ€”this seems normal for applications using that framework. Similarly, other exe files like 'estrutura_principal.exe' and 'modulo_secundario.exe' loading clrjit.dll are also standard as they're related to .NET runtime.\n\nThen, I notice a lot of events where various processes are accessing the registry. Processes like 'cmd.exe', 'conhost.exe', 'elemento_ativo.exe', and others are setting registry values. This might be suspicious because modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. However, legitimate software also modifies the registry during installation or configuration.\n\nThere are two events from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file related to its data directory. This is expected behavior as it's likely setting up its configuration files. No red flags here unless there's something unusual about the path or permissions.\n\nI see multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' accessing both registry and processes. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement, so repeated use without a clear legitimate purpose could be concerning. But sometimes admins use it regularly, so context is needed.\n\nOther processes like 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and 'svchost.exe' also have registry access events. These are common system processes, so their registry interactions are usually normal unless there's something specific about the keys they're modifying.\n\nThe events involving 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll seem normal as these are standard system executables accessing known DLLs for functionality.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are some activities that could be concerning, like multiple registry writes by various processes and PowerShell usage, without additional context (like timestamps showing rapid succession or unusual paths), it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, the sheer number of registry accesses might warrant closer investigation because attackers often use registry modifications for persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting due to the volume of registry activity and the involvement of PowerShell, which is a common tool for adversaries. But I'm not entirely certain without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes accessing the registry and file creation activities by winlogbeat.exe, along with powershell.exe events, suggest potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior that warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are several entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser and would make those connections regularly. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, I see some process creations. For example, whoami.exe being run with its command line pointing to itself doesn't seem unusual unless it's used in an unexpected way. Similarly, cmd.exe running commands like creating services could be part of legitimate system administration tasks or installing software.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is accessed multiple times and there are process accesses and registry value sets. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look closer at what it's doing here. The events don't show any suspicious commands being executed in PowerShell, just accessing processes or modifying the registry.\n\nThe cmd.exe command line looks a bit long and technical. It's creating services with specific paths. That could be part of setting up scheduled tasks or startup items, which might be malicious if those services are doing something harmful, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are several entries from services.exe modifying the registry multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, and it's common for it to make changes when services are started or configured. So this alone isn't a red flag.\n\nLooking at the image load events, processes like pacote_padrao.exe and others are loading known DLLs which are part of .NET framework. This seems normal as those DLLs are standard parts of Windows and .NET environments.\n\nPutting it all together, most events appear to be related to legitimate system activities: browser usage, process creation for tasks, PowerShell access (though a potential area), service creation via cmd, and loading standard libraries. I don't see any clear signs of malicious behavior like unusual file accesses, known malicious process names, or overt indicators of compromise.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of sc.exe to create services might warrant closer inspection because creating multiple services could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Also, the PowerShell access events without specific commands make it hard to assess if they're being misused. \n\nGiven that there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity but some areas that are potentially suspicious, I'd classify this batch as interesting but with a lower confidence level because most activities seem benign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and registry modifications, including potential service setup via cmd.exe and sc.exe. PowerShell access events could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
