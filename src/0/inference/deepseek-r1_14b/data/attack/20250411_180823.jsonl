{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if it's something that needs investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from different processes. The first few events are all related to chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That in itself doesn't seem too suspicious because Chrome is a common browser and these activities are typical.\n\nThen, I see entries for RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and Calculator.exe. Each of these has different log tasks like Registry value sets, Process Creates, Image Loads, and so on.\n\nLooking more closely, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks using schtasks. The task names have patterns like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and the commands they run are \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\". That seems interesting because creating multiple scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe might be an attempt to persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAlso, there are several instances where schtasks.exe is used with similar command lines, each creating a new task that runs calc.exe on logon or startup. This repetition could indicate automated task creation, which might not be normal user behavior.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe together with scheduled tasks can be red flags because these tools are often used in scripting attacks. Additionally, the fact that multiple registry events and file creations are happening suggests potential changes to system configurations, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be legitimate (like regular system processes), the combination—especially the repeated use of schtasks.exe with calc.exe as the command—stands out. This pattern could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or execute malicious code upon system startup or logon.\n\nOverall, while individual events might not raise alarms, the cluster of suspicious activities related to task scheduling and external commands is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks created with calc.exe as command, potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what we've got here. So, I'm supposed to analyze a batch of events in JSONL format and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The output needs to be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the events provided:\n\n1. There are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is 'Registry value set'. This happens six times.\n2. Then there's an entry from 'powershell.exe' accessing something via ProcessAccess.\n3. Lastly, there's a 'whoami.exe' being executed with its command line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each event in context. Chrome setting registry values isn't unusual—browsers often modify settings and can be legitimate. However, multiple instances of the same process making such changes could be suspicious, but without additional info on what exactly is changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe PowerShell access might be more concerning because scripts are often used maliciously. But again, without knowing if this was triggered by a user or part of normal operations, it's tricky.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' execution isn't inherently bad—it's a common tool for identifying system info. But if it's run without reason, especially from an unusual source, that could be a red flag.\n\nBut considering all events together: six Chrome reg changes, two PowerShell accesses, and one whoami. I'm thinking about whether this combination is more than usual. Maybe the volume of registry changes from Chrome stands out. Could multiple registry writes indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms? Possibly.\n\nAlso, having both PowerShell and whoami could be part of a script trying to gather info or escalate privileges. The repeated registry changes might be part of setting up something malicious.\n\nSo, overall, while individually each event isn't too bad, together they raise some eyebrows. I'm leaning towards classification as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination suggests potential malicious activity, but confidence isn't super high without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and process creations\/accesses involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe suggest potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My goal is to analyze all these together and decide if they indicate something malicious.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the events one by one to spot any patterns or anomalies. \n\nThe first few lines show 'svchost.exe' performing registry value sets. That's common because svchost is a legitimate Windows process that often interacts with the registry. But seeing multiple instances of it doing this might be suspicious if there are other red flags.\n\nThen, I notice a file creation event by svchost.exe pointing to C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup. That path looks a bit off. It's in the Task folder, which is where Windows keeps task schedule files. Malware sometimes creates tasks to run at startup, so this could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nMoving on, there are events from cmd.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all performing registry writes. This is concerning because legitimate use of these tools usually doesn't involve such frequent or varied registry modifications unless they're being used for malicious purposes like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nI also see a file creation by winlogbeat.exe in the user's Downloads folder with a .winlogbeat.yml.new extension. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack tool, which is used for log shipping. However, seeing it create files outside its usual directories could be suspicious, especially if it's modifying logs or creating new config files.\n\nAnother red flag is when powershell.exe creates a file named unidade_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is often abused by attackers for execution of malicious scripts, and writing to arbitrary locations can be an indicator of this misuse.\n\nLooking at Chrome events, there are several registry writes and image loads pointing to system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these are legitimate Windows components, frequent access could indicate that something is trying to hide its presence or load malicious modules.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes writing to the registry (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, etc.), file creations in unusual locations (like the Task folder and user Downloads), and the use of potentially dangerous tools like PowerShell suggest a high level of concern. These activities could be part of an attack chain—installer dropping files, creating tasks for persistence, using multiple tools to evade detection.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because it shows signs of potential malicious activity. The combination of registry modifications and file creations across various processes is not typical user behavior and aligns with tactics used by attackers.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry value sets from various processes, including svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe, along with file creation events in unusual locations, suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
