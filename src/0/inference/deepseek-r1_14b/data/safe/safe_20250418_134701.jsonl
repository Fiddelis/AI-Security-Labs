Each event is a JSON object and they all seem to be from the same process, git.exe.

These are TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming utilities. Since these are part of the Cypress testing framework's type definitions, it's normal during development or when setting up a project for such files to be created.\n\nGiven that all events are related to file creation by git.exe in a typical node_modules directory, this doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unusual activity, access to sensitive files, or other behaviors that would suggest malicious intent.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze. Each event is a separate JSON object on its own line. The goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me break down each part and think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each JSON object: there's a \"process\" field with the name \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is being executed here. The \"winlog\" field indicates that a file creation event occurred, specifically mentioning the rule \"FileCreate\". Each event also has a \"file\" path pointing to various .d.ts files within a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nSo, let's think about what this means. Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The process name being git.exe suggests that these events are happening on a Windows system where Git is installed. Now, the file paths all lead to TypeScript definition files (d.ts) inside the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. This makes sense because when working with Node.js and npm packages like Cypress, Git operations such as cloning repositories or updating dependencies might trigger file creation events in these directories.\n\nI need to consider if this batch of events is indicative of malicious activity. Since each event is simply a file creation by Git, it's part of the normal software development lifecycle. Developers using tools like Git would regularly have files created during installations, updates, or when dependencies are added. There’s nothing inherently suspicious about these actions in isolation.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the context of multiple such events occurring together. If these were a single file creation, it might be less concerning, but having 14 consecutive events all related to Git creating files in the same directory could raise an eyebrow. But wait, in this case, each event is creating a different file within the node_modules, which are standard for package structures.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like Git for malicious purposes, such as downloading malware or exfiltrating data. But here, the events don't indicate any unusual behavior beyond what's typical during development setup. There's no sign of files being deleted, executed, or modified in ways that would suggest tampering.\n\nMoreover, the file paths are all within a structured node_modules directory, which is standard for npm packages. The files themselves are TypeScript definitions, which again align with normal software project setups. So, without any anomalies like unexpected file names, locations outside of standard directories, or timestamps indicating unusual activity (like late-night operations), there's no red flag.\n\nI also need to think about confidence levels. While the events don't seem malicious, my confidence is high that this is benign because these are common actions in a development environment using Git and Node.js. The repetitive nature of creating multiple files by Git suggests a legitimate process, such as installing or updating dependencies.\n\nIn summary, each event is a normal file creation by Git during development, occurring within expected directories for npm packages. There's no indication of malicious intent or unusual activity across the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation activities during Git operations in a development environment, specifically within node_modules directory which is standard for npm packages.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object on its own line. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that each entry has a \"process\" field with the name \"git.exe\". The \"winlog\" field indicates that a file was created, and the \"file\" path shows where it was created. All the files are in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. The filenames vary but seem to be related to TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for various functions like invoke, invokeArgs, isBoolean, etc.\n\nSo, the process is git.exe, which typically relates to Git version control system activities. The task is a file creation event, so it's about creating new files or directories. All these files are under node_modules, which is a common directory in Node.js projects where dependencies are stored. Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications, and lodash is a utility library. So, the types folder likely contains type definitions for Cypress to interact with Lodash functions.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is creating multiple files suggests this could be during a Git operation, possibly a clone, fetch, or checkout of a repository. Given that all these are standard TypeScript definition files related to Lodash utilities, it seems like part of the project setup or dependency installation.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, no executable files being created outside of expected locations, and the process is git.exe which is a common tool used in development environments. The creation of these .d.ts files is normal during the setup or update of Node.js modules.\n\nMoreover, all events are consistent with each other—they all originate from the same user (fiddelis), same directory structure, and involve creating type definition files for Cypress and Lodash. There's no variation in the file paths that would indicate a potential spread or multiple infection points. Also, there's no evidence of deleted or modified system files, which might have been red flags.\n\nI should also consider whether such events are typical in a development environment. Developers using Git with projects that include Cypress and Lodash would regularly clone repositories, install dependencies, and create or update these type definition files. So, this activity fits within normal software development workflows.\n\nAnother angle is to check if the timestamps of these events show any unusual patterns. Since they're all from git.exe creating multiple files, it's likely part of a single operation or multiple operations in quick succession during a build or setup process. Without more context on when these logs were generated, but given the consistency, it doesn't raise flags.\n\nLastly, I don't see any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like known malicious file hashes, unusual process names, or writes to unexpected locations outside the project directory. The user account is fiddelis, which seems to be a standard username, not something like SYSTEM or Administrator that might warrant closer scrutiny if used abnormally.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch doesn't indicate any suspicious activity.

Git is a version control system tool commonly used for software development. It's not inherently malicious, so that's a neutral point.\n\nThe windows log task mentions \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". This indicates that a new file was created on the filesystem. While this is a common operation in systems, unusual or multiple such events could raise flags, but in this case, it seems routine.\n\nLooking at the file paths: all of them are under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\". The path structure suggests that these files are part of a Node.js module, specifically Cypress and lodash. These are legitimate tools used in web development.\n\nThe filenames include various \".d.ts\" files, which are TypeScript declaration files. These provide type information for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects and are standard in such environments. So, the creation of these files is expected when setting up or updating a project that uses these modules.\n\nNow, considering all events together: each event shows git.exe creating a specific .d.ts file under a node_modules directory. Node_modules is where third-party libraries are stored, so this aligns with normal development activities. The same process name and repetitive task suggest that someone is working on a project that involves Git, TypeScript, Cypress, and Lodash.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas, or irregular patterns in the number of events.

Git is creating a bunch of files in a node_modules directory. That suggests that someone is working on a project using Node.js and Git. The fact that it's node_modules usually means it's part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project setup. Cypress is likely a testing framework being used here.\n\nIs this normal behavior? Well, when you clone a repository with dependencies, especially if you're setting up a project for the first time, you might run commands like npm install which download and install all the packages, including their type definitions.

The fact that they're in the node_modules folder suggests this is part of a development environment, likely during a build or install process.\n\nI'm thinking about whether such activity is normal. In development setups, especially with tools like npm and yarn, creating files in node_modules is standard when installing packages or building projects. Since all events are from git.exe and the paths follow a logical structure for package types, it doesn't seem suspicious on the surface.\n\nBut wait, could there be any red flags? The frequency of these events might matter. If multiple files are created rapidly, that could indicate something malicious like a file injection attack. However, in this case, each event is separate and follows a pattern typical of legitimate package installations.\n\nAlso, the file paths are all under node_modules, which is a known location for third-party libraries. There's no evidence here of accessing sensitive directories or files outside the project scope. The process name being git.exe also aligns with common development practices, not typical of malicious processes.\n\nI should consider if these events could be part of a larger pattern indicating compromise. If there were other indicators like unusual file accesses or changes in system behavior, it might raise concerns.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I have a batch of 15 JSONL events to analyze. Each event reports the creation of a file by the process \"git.exe\". The files are all under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" and have various .d.ts extensions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these events represent. The process is git.exe, which is commonly used for version control. The task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The paths all end with .d.ts files, which are TypeScript declaration files, often used in projects to define interfaces and types without implementing them.\n\nLooking at the directory structure, node_modules suggests this is part of a Node.js project. Cypress is a popular testing framework for web applications, so it's plausible that someone is setting up or working on a project using Cypress and TypeScript.\n\nNow, considering each event individually might not be necessary since all events are similar in nature—file creations by git.exe in a predictable location. However, I should check if there's anything unusual about these files or the process creating them.\n\nOne red flag could be multiple file creations in quick succession, but without timestamps, it's hard to tell how close together these events occurred. If they're part of a normal build or test process triggered by git, this might not be suspicious at all.\n\nAnother consideration is whether these files are known to be malicious. .d.ts files aren't typically associated with malware; they're standard in TypeScript projects. Also, the path seems legitimate—Cypress types and fp (function properties) modules don't raise any immediate concerns.\n\nI should also think about the user context. The username \"fiddelis\" is generic and doesn't suggest anything nefarious. Without more information on whether this user is authorized to make changes in that directory, it's hard to say, but by default, it seems like a standard development activity.\n\nAdditionally, git.exe is widely used and unlikely to be flagged unless there's unusual behavior tied to its execution, such as running commands outside the expected workflow. Here, it's just creating files, which is part of normal repository management.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious activity. The events align with typical software development practices, specifically in a project using TypeScript and Cypress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe within a node_modules directory as part of a normal development process, indicating no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem similar but with slight variations in the file paths.\n\nLooking at each line, the process name is consistently \"git.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. The file paths are all under the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash, but with different filenames like zipWith.d.ts, fromPairs.d.ts, functions.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo, what's going on here? Well, git.exe is typically used for version control. When you clone a repository or download code using Git, it often creates files in the node_modules directory if you're working with JavaScript or TypeScript projects that use npm packages like Cypress and lodash.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created under the same path suggests that this is part of the normal setup process for a development environment. The repeated file creation events could be related to installing dependencies or setting up a project structure, which is common during development work.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication that these files are being accessed in an unusual way or that there's unauthorized access. All the file paths look legitimate and part of typical software development setups.\n\nThe confidence level is high because all events point to a standard process, so it's unlikely to be suspicious.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of log events here, each in JSONL format. Let me try to figure out what's going on and whether this is something I should look into more closely.\n\nLooking at the first event: it says that \"git.exe\" created a file. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\toPairsIn.d.ts. Hmm, so this seems to be a log of some files being created by the Git process.\n\nI notice that each event is similar but has different file paths. For example, one creates \"toPairsIn.d.ts\", another \"toPath.d.ts\", and so on. These all look like TypeScript definition files within the node_modules folder for Cypress. So it seems like Git is creating multiple files in this specific directory.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's anything unusual here. Git being involved with node_modules might be related to a development environment, maybe someone is working on a project that uses Node.js and Git for version control. The creation of these .d.ts files—those are typically declaration files used by TypeScript to provide type information for JavaScript libraries.\n\nWait, could this be during the setup or installation phase of a project? If someone is cloning a repository or running npm install, it's common for node_modules to be populated and perhaps Git might be involved in some way. But why would Git create these files?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a script being run that uses Git to manipulate files within the node_modules directory. That could be suspicious because typically, you don't want to modify node_modules directly as it can lead to issues with package management.\n\nAnother angle: is this activity happening outside of normal operations? If this user is part of an organization, modifying these files could indicate a potential tampering with dependencies, which might be a security risk. But I'm not sure if creating declaration files is something that's malicious or just part of a development process.\n\nI should also consider the context of the environment. The path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software,\" which sounds like it could be related to a course or project about software quality, maybe even at an educational institution. So perhaps this is a student working on their assignments and using Git for version control.\n\nBut then again, why are so many files being created in quick succession? Each event is the same process creating a file, which seems repetitive but not necessarily malicious. Maybe it's part of an automated script or build process that's setting up these definitions.\n\nOn the other hand, if this activity is unexpected and outside normal user behavior, especially in a corporate environment, it could be worth investigating. It might indicate unauthorized access or some form of lateral movement within the system.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of log injection attacks. Could someone be crafting logs to look like Git activities but are actually part of an attack? But these logs seem too detailed and specific to certain files, which makes me think they're legitimate.\n\nIn terms of indicators, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time might raise flags. If this happened once or twice, it's probably fine, but doing it 14 times could be a sign that something is off.\n\nSo overall, while the individual events don't seem alarming, when taken together, they might suggest some unusual behavior, especially if there's no clear justification for Git to be creating so many files in node_modules. It's possible that this activity is part of a legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI think the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because while each event on its own isn't concerning, the pattern and volume might warrant closer examination to ensure there's no underlying malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory may indicate unusual behavior, potentially related to development activities or potential tampering with dependencies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

They all mention \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes me think this activity is related to Git operations, which are common in software development, especially with version control systems like GitHub.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they all report a file creation task under Windows logs. The files being created are all within the \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\" directory. Each file has a .d.ts extension, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These files define interfaces and types used in TypeScript projects, often generated from JavaScript code to provide type information.\n\nSince the process is git.exe, it's likely that these files are being created or modified during a Git checkout, clone, or pull operation. Node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js applications where dependencies like Cypress (a testing framework) and Lodash (a utility library) are stored. So, this activity seems typical for someone setting up or working on a project that uses these tools.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication of unusual file access times, unknown processes, or creation of files outside expected directories.

Each event has a different file path, but they all point to the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\... and then various filenames like nthArg.d.ts, omit.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo first off, git.exe is a version control tool used for code repositories. It's common for developers to use this. The fact that files are being created in the node_modules directory makes sense because node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored, and cypress is one such package used for testing web applications.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all end with .d.ts, which I know stands for \" declaration TypeScript\" files. These are part of TypeScript projects to declare types without implementing them. So it's normal when a project is being set up or updated, these files would be created as part of the build process.\n\nNow, why would someone look at file creation events? Well, in cybersecurity, sometimes attackers create new files as part of their activities—like dropping malicious scripts or config files. But here, all the activity seems to be related to a legitimate software setup: cypress and node_modules. The user fiddelis is probably working on a project that uses Cypress for testing, hence the creation of these type declaration files.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. All the paths are within expected locations for development tools and libraries. There's no indication of unusual file names or locations outside the scope of typical software development. The repetition of similar events is also normal when multiple files are being set up in a project, perhaps during an npm install or yarn add command.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes legitimate processes can generate a lot of log events, but as long as they're within expected parameters for user activity, they don't warrant investigation. Since all these events are from the same process and involve standard file creation in development directories, there's no reason to suspect malicious behavior here.\n\nI should also think about whether this kind of activity is common enough that it wouldn't be unusual.

I'm given a batch of JSONL events where each event shows that git.exe is creating files in a specific path related to node_modules and cypress types. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. They all seem similar: the process name is git.exe, the task is File created, and the file paths are all within the same directory but different .d.ts files. Since they're all under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash, it looks like these are TypeScript definitions for Lodash functions being generated or modified by Git.\n\nI should consider why someone would be running git.exe in this context. If a user is working with Node.js and using tools like Cypress for testing, having node_modules is normal. The act of creating files in this directory could be part of the build process, maybe during development when dependencies are being updated or installed.\n\nLooking at the file paths, each one ends with .d.ts, which indicates TypeScript declaration files. These are usually generated automatically by tools like TypeScript itself or other libraries to provide type information for JavaScript modules. So it's not unusual for these files to be created as part of the build process.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activities: Malware or attackers typically wouldn't use git.exe in this manner. They might execute scripts or binaries directly, but using common tools like Git for legitimate tasks is more expected in a development environment. There's no evidence here of file creation that's out of place for normal development workflows.\n\nAlso, the fact that all events are from the same process and related to the same directory makes me think this isn't a sign of an attack vector. If it were malicious, I might expect varied file types or locations, or other indicators like unusual file names or paths outside typical project structures.\n\nI should also check if these .d.ts files are expected. Since they're in node_modules and under cypress\/types\/lodash, which is a common library structure, their presence makes sense. Cypress and Lodash are widely used, so having their type definitions generated during development isn't suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be part of an automated process or CI\/CD pipeline? It's possible that Git is being used to manage these files as part of version control, which again is a normal practice for developers managing codebases.\n\nIn summary, each event seems to fit within the expected behavior of a developer using Git in their project.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The key pieces of information in each are:\n\n- **Process**: The name is \"git.exe\". So whatever is happening here is related to Git.\n- **Winlog Task**: All events have the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that files are being created, and it's triggered by a specific rule.\n- **File Path**: Each event has a different file path under \"file.path\". They all start with \"C:\\Users\\...\\\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by various filenames ending with \".d.ts\".\n\nNow, looking at the file paths more closely, they're all within the \"node_modules\" directory. That's a common folder in Node.js projects for third-party libraries. The specific subdirectory is \"cypress\/types\/lodash\", which suggests these are TypeScript type definitions related to Lodash, a utility library for JavaScript.\n\nSince all events involve creating files by git.exe and they're located in a node_modules directory, this likely indicates that Git is being used during the setup or build process of a project. Creating multiple files at once could be part of cloning a repository, installing dependencies, or running scripts that generate code.\n\nI also notice that each file path varies slightly with different functions like \"toLength.d.ts\", \"toLower.d.ts\", etc. These are typical names for TypeScript declaration files, which define interfaces and types used in the project. So it's normal during development to see these being created as part of building or installing dependencies.\n\nThere's no indication of any unusual activity here. The process is straightforward: Git creating multiple files in a standard location for project dependencies. No signs of file creation attempts outside expected paths, no anomalies in the frequency or timing of events that would suggest malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to indicate any suspicious activity. It appears to be part of a normal software development workflow.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a standard node_modules directory during normal project setup or build process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach JSON object has a process named \"git.exe\". The winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created. The file paths are all under the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash with different files like valuesIn.d.ts, without.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo, all events are related to git.exe creating files in a node_modules folder. This looks like standard file operations during development, especially if someone is using Git and possibly working on a project that uses Cypress and lodash. These are common tools, so it's normal for their types files to be created or modified.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The process name is legitimate, the operation is creating files which isn't unusual, and all activities are within expected project directories. There's no indication of unauthorized access, encryption, or other red flags typically seen in suspicious events.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show files being created by git.exe during development, which is normal behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nEach line starts with a JSON object containing three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths all point to different .d.ts files inside the node_modules folder for cypress and lodash.\n\nHmm, so it seems like multiple files are being created by git.exe in a specific directory. Since the path includes \"node_modules\", that suggests this is related to a Node.js project. Cypress is a testing tool often used with Node.js applications, so that makes sense.\n\nI'm wondering why these file creation events would be logged. Git can perform various operations like cloning repositories or pulling updates, which might involve creating files. But seeing a bunch of .d.ts files being created by git.exe is unusual because TypeScript files typically aren't directly handled by git in this way. Usually, git deals with the source control aspects, not the file creation unless it's part of an install process.\n\nWait, node_modules is where third-party libraries are stored. Maybe these events are from installing or updating packages using npm or yarn, which sometimes interact with git repositories. But I'm not sure if that's normal behavior for those tools to create files directly through git.exe.\n\nAnother angle: could this be part of a development workflow? If someone is working on a project and running commands that involve both Node.js package managers and git, maybe these are temporary files or part of an automated process. But even so, seeing a list of specific .d.ts files being created in sequence raises questions about whether it's normal.\n\nI should consider the context. If this happened during a legitimate software development activity, especially with TypeScript projects using Cypress for testing, then these events might not be suspicious on their own. However, the fact that multiple file creation events are logged from git.exe could indicate something more concerning if seen in an environment where such activities aren't expected.\n\nAlso, .d.ts files are declaration files for TypeScript modules. They define types and interfaces but don't contain executable code. So, creating many of them doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity like code execution or data exfiltration.\n\nBut on the other hand, an attacker might use git.exe as part of a malicious script to create files in specific directories, perhaps during a lateral movement phase or to establish persistence. However, without additional context indicating suspicious behavior (like file paths outside node_modules, unusual timestamps, or deviations from normal user activity), it's hard to say.\n\nThe number of events is another point. There are 15 entries here, each creating a different .d.ts file in the same directory. This could be part of a legitimate package installation process that clones repositories and checks out specific files. But it might also indicate automated or script-driven activity, which could be malicious if not authorized.\n\nI'm trying to weigh the confidence level. Since there's no clear indication of malicious intent from these logs alone, but they do represent unusual behavior for git.exe, my confidence is around 0.6 that this batch is interesting. It's more likely than not to warrant further investigation because it could be a sign of unauthorized access or script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple TypeScript declaration files in a node_modules directory, which is consistent with normal development activities using tools like npm\/yarn and Cypress. There's no evidence of malicious behavior or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}\n```"}
