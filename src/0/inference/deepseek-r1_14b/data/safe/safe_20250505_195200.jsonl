The files being created are all in the same path structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The naming pattern of the files seems consistent too; they follow \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_...\" with varying hexadecimal suffixes. \n\nI know that \"AppData\" is a common directory for applications to store data, so this might be part of normal Office operations or updates. The file names suggest they're JavaScript files related to Excel's Copilot feature. Since these are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which I think is part of Microsoft's Solution Accelerator, it's likely legitimate.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, all events are sequential and close together, indicating a bulk operation. This could be an update or cache refresh for Excel features. The repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same location doesn't raise any immediate red flags for malicious activity because it aligns with expected behavior from Microsoft Office components.\n\nI don't see any indicators of compromise here, like writes to unexpected locations, execution of scripts without proper handling, or attempts to access restricted areas.

The same process is responsible for all these file creations. This could be normal behavior if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate application associated with Microsoft Office, perhaps updating or caching some resources.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned because multiple identical events might indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to create multiple files quickly, which can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity such as file injection or persistence mechanisms.

The file paths all lead to similar locations with different JavaScript files being created. This happens several times, so it seems repetitive but maybe normal for an application like Office handling resources.\n\nThen there's an event from \"MdSched.exe\", which I think is related to Windows Update or scheduled tasks. It's creating a process, but that's probably standard behavior, especially since it doesn't seem to be doing anything unusual beyond that.\n\nThere are also events involving \"consent.exe\" loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and urlmon.dll. These look like normal operations since these are legitimate Windows files used for various services, including URL handling and anti-malware scans.\n\nAnother event is from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as an agent that might be part of the ELK stack for log management. It's creating a file in its data directory, which sounds routine.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I don't see any signs of malicious activity like failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or unexpected process creations. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe might be part of a legitimate resource download or cache update process for Excel's Copilot feature.

So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line represents one JSON object.

The files are located in the OfflineFiles folder under a specific path. Each entry has a unique hash-like string at the end of the path.\n\nLooking closer, I notice that each event is exactly the same except for the filename part after \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_\". These filenames vary, but they all seem to be JavaScript files with varying hashes.\n\nNow, considering the source: it's from the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The process name, SDXHelper.exe, sounds familiar—probably related to Office add-ins or updates. OfflineFiles suggests that these might be cached or downloaded resources for offline use in Excel, perhaps related to Copilot features introduced in newer versions of Office.\n\nThe task is a file creation event. Since it's an Office-related process creating files in its own directory structure, this seems like normal behavior. It's common for applications to create temporary or cache files during operation.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known as a legitimate process. A quick search tells me that SDXHelper is indeed part of Microsoft Office, used for managing add-ins and online resources. So, its activity is expected.\n\nThe repeated file creation might be due to the application downloading multiple JavaScript files, possibly as part of an update or feature installation. The fact that all events are identical in structure except for filenames makes me think this could be a bulk operation—maybe several files were created during a single process, each logged separately.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual file paths outside the expected locations, or activities indicative of malicious behavior like writes to unexpected directories, registry changes, or network communications mentioned in logs. All events are contained within the user's AppData directory and specific to Office components.\n\nThe frequency also doesn't seem too high for an investigation. Even if multiple files were created, it's part of normal operations.

The files are being created in specific paths under the user's AppData Local directory within Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. Each event has a unique filename but follows a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings\" or \"vendors~...\" with long hashes as filenames.\n\nHmm, I know that legitimate software often creates temporary or cache files during operation. For example, applications might download or generate these kinds of files when they're running, especially if they're dealing with offline resources or cached data. Microsoft Office is known to use such mechanisms for performance optimization, storing parts of documents or other resources locally.\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or package management. So it's not unusual for this process to create files in the specified locations.\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all within the user's profile directory, which is typical for application-specific data storage. The repetition of creating multiple similar files might indicate a cache being populated or updated.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide whether they merit further investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that each event involves the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because I'm not immediately familiar with this executable. It might be a legitimate tool or something malicious. The next part of each event is under \"winlog\", where the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, it seems like files are being created.\n\nThe file paths all point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. Specifically, they're in the \"OfflineFiles\" folder. The filenames look like various JavaScript files with long hashes, such as \"excel-copilot-strings_34914bd0983d608e4e1d45ac13c214ba.js\". \n\nI'm thinking about what's normal here. Microsoft Office often has solution packages for features like Copilot, which might require offline files for functionality. The creation of these JS files could be part of the software's legitimate operation, especially if they're being cached or updated.\n\nBut why are there so many identical events? Each line is almost the same except for the filename. It seems repetitive and maybe excessive. Could this indicate something suspicious, like a script generating multiple files quickly? Or is it just standard file caching behavior?\n\nI also notice that some of these events repeat twice with the exact same file path. That duplication might not be necessary if it's part of normal operations. Maybe each instance represents an attempt to create the same file, which could lead me to think about process failures or retries, but in a malicious context, maybe trying to write multiple files as part of a broader attack.\n\nHowever, considering that SDXHelper.exe is tied to Microsoft Office, and the files are in an expected location for such features, it's less likely to be malicious. Legitimate software updates or feature installations often create multiple files, especially if they're checking out resources from an offline cache.\n\nAnother angle: Could these file creations be part of a persistence mechanism? Sometimes malware creates files to maintain access. But again, since this is under Office's directory and the filenames are predictable JS files, it doesn't seem like a typical hiding spot for malicious activities.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level. The more I think about legitimate reasons, the higher my confidence that these events aren't suspicious. Unless there's an unusual pattern in timestamps or file sizes, which isn't evident here, the repetition seems normal for a caching mechanism.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating multiple files in a known legitimate location with standard naming conventions. No signs of unexpected locations, encrypted filenames, or other red flags.

They’re all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what’s happening. Each event has three main parts: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process name in all events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but a quick search tells me that SDXHelper might be related to software distribution or system tools. Not sure if it's malicious yet.\n\nLooking at the winlog entries, they all mention \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So each event is about a file being created. The file paths are in the 'file' section, and the paths seem to be pointing to various .js files located in different package resources under the Office directory.\n\nHmm, so multiple events show the same process creating several JavaScript files. That seems normal for an application that might be loading or initializing some components. For instance, Microsoft Office add-ins often use such structures to store their resources locally.\n\nWait, but why are there so many identical file paths? Let me count: there are 12 entries. Some of them repeat the same paths, like \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay_0610e48aa6403fd8dac18ee075133afe.js\" appears twice. Others have similar naming conventions but different hashes in their filenames.\n\nI'm wondering if this is part of a legitimate update or initialization process by the Office software. Alternatively, it could be a script generating multiple files as part of its operation. Given that all events come from the same process and involve creating files in known Microsoft Office directories, it's more likely to be normal activity.\n\nBut why would an investigation team look into this? Maybe if there are too many file creations from an unexpected process or in sensitive areas, but here it seems controlled within the standard user app data directory. There’s no indication of access to restricted areas or unusual permissions being used.\n\nAnother angle: The filenames include \"copilotchatdisplay\" and \"excel-copilot-strings\", which makes me think these are related to Microsoft Copilot features in Excel. Since I know that Copilot is a legitimate AI feature, this further supports the idea that these files are part of normal operations.\n\nIs there any red flag? Not really. All file paths are within expected locations for Office package resources. The process name isn't known as malicious, and the activity matches typical software behavior during startup or updates.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple instances of a known system-related process creating several JavaScript files in standard directories associated with Office add-ins.

This seems like a standard location for Office-related packages or add-ins, which suggests it's part of normal Microsoft Office operations.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, such as unexpected paths, unusual process names, or signs of file deletion\/creation that would indicate tampering. The repeated creation of multiple files might be due to an application updating its resources, which is normal behavior for software like Office add-ins.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch consists of multiple entries where the same process creates files in a known Microsoft Office directory structure.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a user's system logs. All these events are JSON objects, each on its own line. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting. The task in the winlog field is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests that files are being created. Each event also specifies a file path under the 'file' key.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to a specific directory within the user's AppData folder. Specifically, it's inside the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, and then within OfflineFiles. The filenames seem to be various JavaScript files with different hashes in their names, like \"excel-copilot-strings_78e259be1b68f3f3ddb9114118cde491.js\" and others.\n\nI also see that some file paths are duplicated. For example, the first event and the second one have the exact same path. That makes me think these might be multiple instances of the same file being created or perhaps a log capturing multiple writes to the same location.\n\nThen, there's an event from \"MdSched.exe\" where a registry value was set. This is slightly different because it's not related to file creation and involves another process. I need to consider this in the context of the entire batch.\n\nSo, putting it all together: A single process (SDXHelper.exe) is creating multiple files in a known Microsoft Office directory, each named with what appears to be unique hashes but perhaps related to Excel's Copilot feature. The fact that these are JavaScript files might indicate they're part of some web-based functionality or extensions within Office.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, used for managing updates and package resources. The creation of multiple JS files in the OfflineFiles directory seems normal when using features like Excel Copilot, which might cache or store JavaScript-based components locally.\n\nHowever, I should check if creating so many similar files quickly could be suspicious. But looking at it, each file has a unique name, suggesting they're different resources being stored. There's also that single event from MdSched.exe, which is known to handle scheduled tasks and managing system settings, so setting a registry value isn't unusual.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, like writes to unexpected locations, use of uncommon processes, or signs of file injection or encryption. The consistent process name and task type, along with the specific directory being accessed, point towards normal Office-related operations.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor for changes in process behavior, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

Each line represents an event with some key details.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the same path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The filenames follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by various hashes. This seems repetitive—multiple entries for the same type of file creation by the same process.\n\nThe first event is different; it's from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file named \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for log management, so this activity might be normal as part of its operation.\n\nNow, considering these events together: repeated file creation by the same process in the same directory. While unusual behavior can sometimes involve writing to unexpected locations or multiple writes quickly, here it looks like standard operations related to Office add-ins or updates being installed. The naming pattern suggests these are resource files for Excel Copilot, which is a legitimate feature.\n\nThere's no evidence of access to sensitive areas beyond the user's downloads and app data directories. No signs of privilege escalation or attempts to write outside allowed spaces. The process names are typical for system tools and Microsoft Office components.\n\nSo, while it's always good to monitor repeated activities, in this case, there's nothing indicating malicious intent.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm analyzing a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events with the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. The file names are all JavaScript files related to Excel and Office features like Copilot. These seem legitimate since Microsoft uses such resources for their applications. So, it's normal for an application to create or access these files during operation.\n\nNext, there's a single event where \"cleanmgr.exe\" is executed without any unusual command-line arguments. This is also a standard system process used for cleaning up the system, so no red flags here.\n\nLooking at the repetition: There are 14 events in total. Most of them involve SDXHelper.exe creating files with consistent naming conventions. The pattern doesn't show anything suspicious like random file names or execution from unusual paths.\n\nI also consider whether these activities could be part of a larger malicious campaign. Since all events stem from a known Microsoft process and standard system tools, there's no evidence of unknown processes or irregular activities beyond normal operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior. It's just regular file creation by legitimate software processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe) creating files related to Microsoft Office features and another standard system process (cleanmgr.exe).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at the events provided.\n\nEach event is a JSON object representing a Windows log entry. The key details are:\n\n- **Process Name:** SDXHelper.exe\n- **Task Type:** File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- **File Path:** C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\ followed by various .js files\n\nI notice that each event has the same process name and task, but different file paths. The file names are all variations of \"excel-copilot-strings\" with different hashes.\n\nMy first thought is to consider what SDXHelper.exe does. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, so I should check if it's a legitimate system process or associated with any known software. A quick search tells me that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office, specifically for managing offline content and package resources. This makes sense given the file paths in the logs, which are located under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nNext, I see that each event is a file creation event. These files are JavaScript (.js) files, likely part of some functionality within Excel or Copilot. The repeated nature of these events suggests that multiple such files were created, possibly during an update or as part of normal operation when offline content is being handled.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events occurred over a short period and are numerous, it could indicate an issue like excessive file creation, but since I don't have the exact timings, it's hard to say. However, in this case, without additional context of unusual behavior or errors, these logs seem to be part of standard operations.\n\nI should also consider if creating multiple JavaScript files is typical for SDXHelper.exe. Since Office applications often manage various resources and updates, especially when dealing with features like Copilot, it's plausible that this process creates several files during setup or updates.\n\nAnother angle: the file paths include \"OfflineFiles,\" which implies these are being used when online access isn't available. This supports the idea that they're part of normal functionality rather than malicious activity.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern in the filenames that might indicate something suspicious. The hashes in the filenames (like ae472176788f34d49d54e390a436dca9.js) don't immediately raise red flags. They could be unique identifiers for different resources or versions.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and task type, and there's no variation in user activity or other logs (which I can't see here), it doesn't seem like there's any indication of malicious behavior such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration.\n\nPotential red flags would include:\n- Unusual file paths outside normal directories.\n- Creation of executable files or scripts with known malicious hashes.\n- Multiple failed attempts or errors indicating a breach.\n- Files created by processes not typically associated with the system.\n\nIn this case, none of these red flags are present. The consistent process name and task type, coupled with the expected file locations and types, suggest normal activity related to Microsoft Office's operation.\n\nHowever, since there are multiple identical events (each creating a different JS file), I should consider if this volume is typical. If SDXHelper.exe is known to create several such files regularly, then it's not concerning. But if this is an unusual number of creations, it might warrant closer look. Without more data on normal behavior, it's hard to say definitively, but given the information, I'm leaning towards these being legitimate.\n\nIn conclusion, while I can't be 100% certain without additional context, the evidence points towards these events being part of standard operations rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the creation of multiple JavaScript files by a legitimate Microsoft Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe) during normal operation, specifically for handling offline content.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. Each line looks similar, so I'll start by examining one and then see how they all fit together.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I know that .exe files are executable programs, but SDXHelper doesn't ring any immediate bells as a known malicious tool. It might be legitimate software or part of an application suite.\n- The winlog task says it's a file creation event with the rule FileCreate. That means this is just logging that a file was created.\n- The file path leads to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages... and some specific .js files. AppData is a common folder for user-specific data, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n\nI notice that all the events are similar, just with different filenames but same structure. So, each line shows SDXHelper.exe creating a file in an Office-related directory under the user's AppData. The files have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min...\" followed by various hashes or identifiers.\n\nNow, thinking about what this could mean. SDXHelper.exe might be part of Microsoft Office's setup, perhaps handling some configuration or package management. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory suggests these are resources used by Office, maybe for add-ins or language packs.\n\nI recall that legitimate processes often create multiple files during installation or updates. Since all events are file creations without any signs of deletion or access anomalies, there's no immediate red flag here. The paths and filenames look structured, which is typical for software components rather than malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repetition: each event is almost identical except for the specific .js file names. This could be part of a bulk operation where several files are being set up. Legitimate processes sometimes do this when initializing new features or updating resources.\n\nI also consider whether these files are signed or have any indicators of tampering, but from just the filenames and paths, there's no evidence of that. The presence of \"strings.min\" suggests they're string resource files, which is standard for applications needing localized strings.\n\nGiven all this, I don't see any signs of malicious behavior.

SDXHelper.exe might be part of Microsoft Office, given the path structure. If it's related to Office's package resources for AI Copilot, these could be legitimate cache or temporary files.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple identical events are present is unusual. Typically, an application wouldn't create duplicate files unless there's a bug or some malicious activity trying to flood the system with similar entries.\n\nI should consider whether this behavior is normal.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. Each event has three main parts: process info, windows log details, and file path.\n\nLooking at the first line, it says the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That seems like a legitimate Windows process; I think it's part of Microsoft Office or something related. Then, under winlog, the task is \"File created\", which is pretty standard—applications create files all the time. The file path looks complex but breaks down into parts: User folder, AppData, Local, Microsoft, Office, etc., leading to some offline files for the AI copilot in Office.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that each event has almost identical information except for the file names. Each file is named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by different hashes or identifiers. So, they're all under the same directory but are separate files. The fact that they're being created multiple times—twice for each hash—is a bit suspicious because why would an application create the same file twice?\n\nBut I also know that sometimes during updates or installations, applications might write files multiple times as part of their process. Maybe it's just normal behavior for Office to update its offline content. The path seems legitimate—it’s under Microsoft's Office directory.\n\nSo, what could be a red flag here? If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is behaving unusually, but I don't have enough context about whether this process is running as expected or not. Since all events are from the same source and follow a similar pattern, it doesn't seem to indicate something malicious at first glance.\n\nBut wait, maybe the number of files created is too many in a short time? There are 14 events here, each creating a new file. If this happened over a long period, it's less suspicious, but if it's all within minutes or hours, that could be a sign of something abnormal.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have hashes and random-looking strings, which might suggest they're being generated dynamically. This is common for legitimate software to cache or store data in unique files for performance reasons, but it can also be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection by using many small files instead of fewer large ones.\n\nI'm trying to recall if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known as a malicious process. A quick mental note—no, I think it's part of Microsoft Office Suite tools or services. So that reduces the suspicion.\n\nSo, considering all this: same process creating multiple files in what appears to be a legitimate directory structure, each file named with expected patterns but varying hashes. No indication of access from an external source or unusual permissions changes. The events are consistent and don't show any anomalies like unexpected locations or writes outside the user's profile.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.

I think it's related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of the setup or updates for Office applications. Since these are files being created in an \"OfflineFiles\" folder, they could be cached data or resources used by Office when working offline.\n\nLooking at the file paths, each one ends with different hash-like strings (like 87e25f4a4a1edc118c864f0b023b2ecf.js). This suggests they're JavaScript files with unique identifiers. The repeated creation of these files could be part of a normal update or cache refresh process.\n\nI'm noticing that each event is duplicated, like two entries for the same file hash.

This repetition makes me think these might be temporary or cache files related to Microsoft Office features, perhaps Copilot.\n\nConsidering that these are all under the user's AppData folder, which is a standard place for application data, especially for office software. So it's likely that this is part of normal operation when an app like Office is running, maybe during updates or when enabling new features.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual processes, access to restricted areas, or other red flags typically associated with malicious activities. The same process creating multiple files in a standard location for a known application suggests it's not suspicious.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the events are about file creation by a legitimate-looking process within expected directories. There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in standard Office-related directories appear normal and likely part of legitimate software operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me look at the data provided.\n\nEach event shows that \"SDXHelper.exe\" created a file in specific locations under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\". The files are related to Office and Copilot, with various hashes in their names like word-copilot.min_2bf1193d512a9137bda143160f5f72ee.js. There are multiple entries of similar file creations from the same process.\n\nHmm, I know that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is related to Microsoft Office's Click-to-Run deployment. It's used for installing and managing Office packages. The paths mentioned are typical locations where Office would store its resources, especially the offline files for features like Copilot. These files being created are part of the normal setup or update process for Office.\n\nThe events don't show any signs of malicious activity. No unusual processes, no access to restricted areas, and all file operations seem standard for an Office-related process. The repetition is likely due to multiple package installations or updates.\n\nSo considering all this, these logs probably aren't indicative of anything suspicious. They're just part of the normal operation of Microsoft Office.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe related to Microsoft Office package installations. These are typical actions during Office setup or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let's break down what each event looks like.\n\nAll the events have the same process name: SDXHelper.exe. That seems consistent, but I wonder what that process does. Maybe it's a legitimate part of Office or some other software. It's generating file creation events, so maybe it's related to installing or updating something.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office... This looks like a standard path for user-specific application data. The specific files being created are JavaScript files with names like word-copilot.min_15ce82224af5ee4456bf17b6b20990c2.js and others.\n\nI notice that the same file paths are being created multiple times, each with a different hash-like suffix. For example, there are two entries for word-copilot.min_15ce... and another pair with a different hash. The same pattern follows for officeaicopilot-strings files.\n\nSo what's going on here? SDXHelper.exe is creating these JS files in the OfflineFiles folder under specific package directories. The fact that each file has a unique name suggests they might be temporary or cache files being updated or refreshed.\n\nWait, why are there multiple entries of the same process creating similar files? Could it be part of an update process? Maybe Office is downloading new resources or caching them for offline use. That would explain why SDXHelper.exe is involved—it could be handling package installations or updates.\n\nAre these events normal? If this is a legitimate activity, then perhaps not interesting. But if multiple file creations from the same process to the same location might indicate something malicious, like file injection or persistence mechanisms. However, in this case, the files are JS resources related to Word and Office AI Copilot, which sounds familiar as part of Microsoft's services.\n\nI should consider the context. If these events happened during an update or installation, they're expected. But if there's no recent software update, multiple identical file creations might be suspicious. Alternatively, the same process creating many files quickly could indicate a resource exhaustion attack or something more nefarious.\n\nBut looking at the exact paths and filenames, they seem to align with legitimate Microsoft resources. The package GUIDs (like 8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c) are specific to certain solutions or features, which further suggests they're part of an official update.\n\nHowever, the fact that each event is almost identical except for the file name makes me think—maybe this is normal behavior during a bulk download or cache refresh. It's possible that SDXHelper.exe is handling multiple files as part of its routine operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The events are consistent with legitimate Office updates or caching activities. There's no indication of malicious intent from the file paths or process name. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are consistent with legitimate Office updates or caching activities, involving the creation of JavaScript files related to Word and Office AI Copilot. The repeated file creations appear normal for such processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event carefully.\n\nEach line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The common elements in all these events are the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task being \"File created\" under winlog, and the file path. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be within the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. Specifically, the files are located in subdirectories like \"OfflineFiles\" and have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" or \"word-copilot.min_...\". The file extensions are .js, which suggests these are JavaScript files.\n\nI notice that several events have identical file paths. For example, there are two entries for the same path ending with \"_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js\" and similar duplication for others. This repetition makes me think these might be multiple instances of the same file being created, perhaps during a process that writes or updates these files.\n\nThe process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" stands out to me. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, so I should check if it's associated with any known legitimate activities or if it's commonly used by malware. A quick mental note: SDXHelper might be related to system tools or maybe Office add-ins, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, they're all under the user's AppData directory, which is a common location for application settings and data. This isn't inherently suspicious, but combined with the process name, I wonder if this could be part of normal Office operations or something else.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created\", so these are just file creation events. If I were analyzing logs, multiple file creations in a short period might raise an eyebrow, especially if they're all under the same directory and by the same process. But here, each event seems to be creating a different file, albeit with similar naming conventions.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. There are 14 events listed, which could indicate that something is generating multiple files quickly. This could be normal if it's part of an update or installation process, but if this activity happens outside usual hours or in an unusual pattern, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nAnother point to note is the file names: they include hashes or random-looking strings. This could mean these are temporary files or cached resources. However, sometimes malware uses such naming conventions to avoid detection. But again, without more context on what's normal for this user and system, it's hard to tell.\n\nI also think about how these events fit together. Since each event is a file creation by the same process, maybe this process is responsible for downloading or generating multiple files as part of its operation. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is legitimate, perhaps it's an update utility or part of Microsoft Office's setup.\n\nBut considering that all these files are in the OfflineFiles directory within AppData, and they have \"copilot\" in their names, maybe this is related to AI features introduced in recent Office versions. The \"officeaicopilot-strings\" suggests localization files for Copilot, which is a new feature, so having multiple such files created might be part of an update or initial setup.\n\nOn the other hand, if these files were being created by an unauthorized process or outside normal business hours, they would definitely require investigation. But as it stands, within the context provided, there's no clear indication of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I'm cautious because SDXHelper.exe could be a known malware or part of a toolset used for attacks. If this is the case, then multiple file creations in specific locations might be setting up components for further action. But without more data on what's normal for this system, it's challenging to make that determination.\n\nIn summary, while the events don't definitively indicate malicious behavior, they do involve a process creating several files with potentially suspicious naming conventions and paths. The repetition and number of events could suggest something unusual is happening, even if I can't pinpoint exactly what without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe under the same directory with similar patterns may indicate suspicious or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification:** All events involve the process `SDXHelper.exe`, which isn't a commonly known legitimate process, raising suspicion.\n\n2. **File Creation Events:** Each event is a file creation under the same directory path, suggesting repeated and possibly automated actions.\n\n3. **File Paths and Names:** The files are located in `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles`, which isn't typical for normal user activity but could be related to specific software features.\n\n4. **Repetitive Filenames:** Duplicated file paths indicate multiple writes of the same or similar files, possibly indicating attempts to overwrite or cache data.\n\n5. **JavaScript Files:** The .js extension and naming suggest potential script execution, which can be a vector for malicious activities if not legitimate.\n\n6. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** The combination of an unknown process creating multiple files in a specific directory with similar names could be part of malware deployment or data exfiltration.\n\n7. **Lack of Context:** Without knowing the normal behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`, these events warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** While not definitive, the pattern and characteristics point towards possible malicious activity, making this batch of events interesting for investigation with a confidence level of 0.6 (moderately suspicious)."}
