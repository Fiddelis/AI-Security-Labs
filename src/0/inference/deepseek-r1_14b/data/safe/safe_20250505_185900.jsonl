{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events are about \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in Windows logs, both involving powershell.exe. These seem like normal PowerShell startup activities, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nNext, there's a \"Pipe Created\" event from the same process. This is common when processes communicate over pipes, which is typical for legitimate operations. No red flags here.\n\nThen, an \"Image loaded\" event shows that MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll are being loaded by powershell.exe. MpClient is part of Windows Defender, so it's expected. Urlmon is a standard DLL used in URL handling, also normal for scripts like PowerShell accessing resources.\n\nMoving on, there's a \"Process Create\" event for ipconfig.exe with the \/all parameter. Using ipconfig to gather detailed network info isn't unusual, especially in scripts. However, since this is triggered by powershell.exe, it's worth noting but not necessarily malicious unless used inappropriately.\n\nAnother \"Process accessed\" event on powershell.exe doesn't raise any alarms; processes often access each other for various legitimate reasons.\n\nFinally, a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe for .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool being set up, possibly monitoring logs. The creation of its config file could be part of normal setup or updates. If this process is authorized, it's fine; if not, it might indicate unauthorized logging.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, most events are standard system activities involving PowerShell and related processes. While some actions like using ipconfig with \/all might be monitored for policy compliance, they don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior. The only potentially concerning point is the creation of a new config file by winlogbeat.exe, but without context on what this process is or why it's running, it's hard to say.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of these events, when considered together, clearly indicate malicious activity. However, I'll give it a confidence level just below high because while each event alone is normal, unusual combinations could hint at something, but here they seem routine.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard system processes and activities, such as PowerShell executions and process creations, which do not indicate malicious behavior when considered collectively.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events from Windows logs, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event doesn't have much information; it's just \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"None\"},\"process\":null,\"file\":null. Not sure about that yet.\n\nNext, there's a Process Create event for winlogbeat.exe. I know that winlogbeat is often used for log management, like shipping logs to the ELK stack. So this might be normal if it's part of their monitoring setup.\n\nThen, there's a Process Access event for powershell.exe. PowerShell can do a lot of things, both good and bad. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just routine admin work.\n\nAfter that, there are several Image Load events from winlogbeat.exe. These are just the program loading necessary modules, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThere are also multiple File Create events from winlogbeat.exe creating log files and lock files. That seems normal for a logging service to keep track of its data and state.\n\nThen I see two Registry value set events, one from mmc.exe and another from Explorer.EXE. MMC is the Microsoft Management Console, often used by admins, and Explorer.EXE is just the Windows shell. These are common activities, so probably not malicious on their own.\n\nNext up is a Process Create event for powershell.exe again. This time, it's using the command line path to PowerShell. So it's starting another instance of PowerShell. That could be normal, but since we're seeing multiple instances, I should note that.\n\nThere are several Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is standard when any program starts and initializes.\n\nThen there's a File Create event by powershell.exe creating a temporary file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1 in the user's Temp directory. That's interesting because it's a PowerShell script being created, possibly for testing script execution policies. This could be legitimate if an admin is checking policies, but it might also indicate something malicious like downloading or executing scripts without proper permissions.\n\nFollowing that, there's a File Delete logged event from powershell.exe deleting the same temporary file. So the script was created and then deleted, which could mean it wasn't executed, or perhaps it was a test to see if the file can be created and deleted. Either way, the creation and deletion of temp scripts is something that could warrant investigation.\n\nThen there are several Provider Lifecycle events from PowerShell again. These seem to be about initializing or finalizing some operations, which doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch starts with winlogbeat.exe setting up logs normally. Then powershell.exe is used multiple times, including creating and deleting a temp script. While the initial events are normal, the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in Temp might indicate some malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary.\n\nI need to consider if this combination is common or not. Legitimate scripts might be created and deleted during operations, but the fact that it's done by an external process (winlogbeat) and then PowerShell could suggest possible lateral movement or persistence techniques. Alternatively, maybe it's just part of some automated script testing.\n\nThe confidence level: I'm about 75% confident because while individual events aren't suspicious on their own, the combination of creating a temp script with a name that includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" and deleting it quickly could be indicative of attempting to bypass policy restrictions or test them. But without more context, like additional malicious indicators in the logs, I'm not 100% sure.\n\nSo, overall, this batch is likely interesting enough for further investigation because there's some behavior that stands out as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows unusual activity including the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
