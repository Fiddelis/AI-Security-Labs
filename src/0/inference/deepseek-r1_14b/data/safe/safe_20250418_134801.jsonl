{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of events is relevant for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. They all have similar structures: process name is \"git.exe\", the task is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\", and the file path varies but follows a pattern.\n\nLooking closer, all these events are related to files being created by git.exe. The file paths point to different JavaScript files under the node_modules\/semver directory. This seems like part of a Node.js module called semver, which is used for semantic versioning.\n\nThe presence of multiple files being created in the node_modules directory suggests that this might be during a npm install or some package setup process. Git.exe could be involved in checking out code or managing dependencies, especially if someone is working on a project that uses Node.js and git.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The actions are typical for installing or updating node modules. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas, or other red flags that might indicate an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nSince all these events are part of normal software development activities, they likely don't pose a security risk. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or package installation and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to analyzing logs for security, but I'll do my best.\n\nLooking at the first two events, they mention \"MpCmdRun.exe\" which I think is related to Windows Defender. The task is about an image being loaded. That seems normal because defender would load its components. But then there's an event with null values; not sure what that means yet. Maybe just a placeholder or something.\n\nThen, from the third event onwards, it's all about \"git.exe\" creating files in a directory related to node_modules\/semver. Git is a version control tool, so it makes sense for it to create files during a repository sync or installation. The paths look like they're part of a project structure, which is typical when developers are working with Node.js modules.\n\nI'm wondering if there's any malicious activity here. The semver package manager handles semantic versioning, which is standard in software development. All these file creations seem to be part of the normal setup process for a project. I don't see any signs of unusual paths or executables being loaded outside of what's expected.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because everything points to legitimate activitiesâ€”defender loading its modules and git updating the project files. No red flags like unknown processes or writes to system directories.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal activity from Windows Defender and Git creating files in a Node.js project directory, indicating legitimate operations rather than malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a file creation event from winlogbeat.exe at the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is an agent used for log management, so it's probably creating some configuration files.\n\nNext, I see svchost.exe making registry changes twice. Svchost.exe is a common system process that runs many services, so it shouldn't be suspicious on its own. Registry modifications are typical for services to run correctly.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a standard Windows app, and urlmon.dll is part of the Windows monoculture, handling URL parsing. No red flags here; seems like normal operation.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe being executed with specific parameters for BthAvctpSvc. That service is related to Bluetooth audio, so again, this looks legitimate.\n\nChrome.exe also makes a registry change. Browsers often interact with the registry for settings and extensions, so that's not unusual.\n\nMsMpEng.exe loads taskschd.dll. MsMpEng is part of Windows Defender, and taskschd.dll is used by task scheduler. This is expected behavior for security software.\n\nThere are multiple file creation events from svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That's a standard Windows feature that helps with app updates, so those files are probably optimization caches or logs. Not suspicious.\n\nI notice MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating and then deleting a file. Edge update often downloads and installs updates, so temporary files being created and deleted is normal.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading some DLLs and creating a lock file in the Temp directory. This is related to Windows Defender operations, which would typically create such files for scans or updates.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe are shell processes, possibly used by remote sessions or scripts. They setting registry values might be part of their operation, especially if they're handling environment variables or configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: All events seem to involve standard system processes performing normal operations. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, multiple failed attempts, or signs of malware activity. No process names are flagged as malicious, and the activities described don't deviate from expected behaviors. So overall, this batch doesn't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing standard operations such as file creation, registry modifications, and loading DLLs for legitimate services like Windows Defender and Edge Update.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of Windows event logs provided in JSONL format. My goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: The first two events show Microsoft Edge-related processes creating files and changing file creation times. This seems normal as part of an update process.\n   \n2. **CompatTelRunner.exe**: Next, there are a couple of entries where CompatTelRunner.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Both of these are legitimate Windows components related to antivirus and antispyware scanning, so no red flags here.\n\n3. **setup.exe Pipe Creation**: The fifth event has setup.exe creating a pipe. Setup processes often create pipes for communication, which is standard during installations or updates.\n\n4. **Services.exe Logon Events**: There are multiple entries where services.exe logs on, and some special logons. Services.exe is part of Windows services management; these events are typical during system operations.\n\n5. **User Account Management**: Several events indicate user account management tasks. This could be related to group policy updates or user activity monitoring, which are normal.\n\n6. **File Creation in Windows Logs**: An event shows a new file being created in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. That's standard for update processes tracking their activities.\n\n7. **taskhostw.exe and svchost.exe Activity**: taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal as it's related to Task Scheduler. Similarly, svchost.exe setting registry values is expected since it hosts various system services.\n\n8. **Powershell Execution with Restricted Policy**: The 19th event stands out. Powershell is being executed with a restricted execution policy. The command seems to be checking for specific .inf files in the Windows directory. This could be suspicious because using Powershell with such restrictions might indicate an attempt to execute code that could potentially harm the system, especially when dealing with sensitive files like .inf.\n\n9. **Chrome DNS Query**: The last event shows Chrome making a DNS query. That's normal browser behavior and doesn't raise any flags.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are routine system operations related to updates, services, and user management. However, the Powershell execution catches my attention. While it's using a restricted policy, which is safer than unrestricted, the command itself could be probing for sensitive information or attempting unauthorized actions. Malicious actors might use such commands to gather information or execute malicious scripts.\n\nI'm moderately confident that this batch is interesting because of the Powershell activity, even though other events are normal. The combination of legitimate activities and this potential red flag makes the entire batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activity with a restricted execution policy potentially probing system files, indicating possible malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

That's a red flag because git is commonly used for version control, but sometimes malicious actors use it too. But in this case, the task is \"File created,\" which seems normalâ€”files being written or updated by git during operations like cloning, pulling, or installing dependencies.\n\nNext, looking at the file paths: all files are under a node_modules directory, specifically within semver packages. Semver is a versioning tool used in Node.js projects. The fact that multiple files are being created here makes me think it's part of a package installation process. This is common when someone installs or updates dependencies using npm or yarn.\n\nConsidering the combination of all events: 14 file creation events, all under node_modules\/semver. This suggests that the system is setting up or updating a Node.js project, which is standard during development or CI\/CD processes. There's nothing unusual about git creating files in a node_modules directoryâ€”itâ€™s part of how packages are managed.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here, like file deletions, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute scripts outside the expected workflow. The paths are all within standard project directories, and the process is associated with a legitimate tool (git).\n\nSo, while it's good practice to monitor such activities, this batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior.

Each event is a JSON object with three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name in all these events is \"git.exe\", which immediately makes me think it's related to Git operations. \n\nThe task from the winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so each event indicates that a file was created.

So, I'm given several JSONL entries where each line represents an event from system logs. The goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and decide if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at the events, they all have similar structures but let me break them down:\n\nEach event has three main components:\n1. **process**: The name is \"git.exe\". So, this seems like Git-related activity.\n2. **winlog**: The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, each event indicates a file creation.\n3. **file**: Each has the same path pattern but different filenames ending with .js or .d.ts.\n\nLooking at the paths:\n- They all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\" followed by various files like isNumber.js, isObject.js, etc. \n\nSo, this looks like Git is creating several files in the node_modules\/tcomb\/lib directory. Tcomb is a JavaScript library for type checking, so these are likely part of that module.\n\nNow, why might someone find this interesting? Well, malicious activities often involve file creations, but in this case, it's happening during a legitimate processâ€”installing or updating a Node.js package. The files being created are standard library files, which Git would handle when cloning or pulling repositories.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like unexpected paths, unusual filenames, or multiple writes to sensitive areas.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I've been given a batch of 14 JSONL events to analyze. Each event reports that the git.exe process created a file in a specific path. The files are all within the node_modules\/tcomb\/lib directory, which seems related to a Node.js module called tcomb.\n\nI need to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that git.exe is commonly used for version control and can be associated with legitimate activities like cloning repositories or updating code. The fact that multiple files are being created in a node_modules folder suggests that this might be part of a build process or an npm install operation. Node modules are standard in web development projects, so it's normal to see these files being created during setup.\n\nLooking at the file paths, each one is unique but follows a predictable naming convention (e.g., fromJSON.js, func.js). This pattern aligns with how JavaScript libraries structure their code. There doesn't seem to be any irregularity or unusual file names that might hint at malicious activity.\n\nAnother point to consider is the volume of events. While 14 events in one go might seem a lot, when you're dealing with processes like npm installing dependencies, especially for larger projects, it's common to see multiple files being written or accessed at once. This isn't indicative of anything suspicious on its own.\n\nI also need to think about the source of these logs. If they're from a system where developers are actively working on software, such as a CI\/CD pipeline or a development environment, this activity is entirely normal. There's no evidence here that points towards unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors.\n\nOne aspect I should check is the timestamps of these events. If they're all occurring within a very short period, it might suggest a batch operation, which is standard for builds or installations. However, without knowing the exact timing, it's hard to say, but the context still leans towards normal behavior.\n\nI should also consider if any of these files are being accessed in an unusual way after creation. Since each event only reports file creation and nothing else, there's no indication of subsequent actions that could be harmful.\n\nLastly, I think about whether tcomb is a known malicious module. From what I recall, tcomb is a legitimate library for TypeScript type checking. So, the presence of these files doesn't suggest any malware or exploit.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch of events seems to be part of a routine software development process, specifically related to setting up or updating a Node.js project with git. There's nothing unusual in the file paths, process name, or event types that would raise red flags. Therefore, I classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple files within a node_modules directory during what appears to be a legitimate software development or build process. The file paths are consistent with standard Node.js module structures, and the volume of creates is typical for such operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
