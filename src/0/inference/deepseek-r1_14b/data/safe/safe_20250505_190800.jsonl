{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to see if it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. That catches my eye because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's being invoked with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\" is particularly interesting. Bypassing execution policies can be a red flag as attackers might use this to run scripts that are otherwise blocked.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a pattern of file creation and deletion related to PowerShell scripts. For example, there's a file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1\" that's created and then deleted shortly after. This kind of behavior can be indicative of script testing or potentially malicious activity trying to avoid detection by cleaning up traces.\n\nAdditionally, the events show several ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs when powershell.exe runs. While this is normal in some contexts, the combination with the execution policy bypass makes me more cautious. It's possible that these DLLs are part of legitimate operations, but without deeper analysis, it's hard to rule out malicious intent.\n\nThere are also FileCreate events for \"teste.ps1\" and \".winlogbeat.yml.new\". The naming doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but coupled with the other activities involving powershell.exe, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe presence of multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in the logs might indicate that PowerShell is being used extensively or perhaps in a way that's not typical for standard operations. This could be part of a larger script or toolset being executed.\n\nWhile there are no overt signs like failed logins, unusual network traffic, or direct indicators of compromise (IoCs), the combination of these events—especially the execution policy bypass and file manipulation—suggests potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell to execute a script on the system, which could be part of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or setting up persistence.\n\nIn summary, while not conclusive evidence, the batch shows behavior that deviates from normal patterns, particularly around the use of powershell.exe with execution policy changes and file operations. This makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation to determine if it's part of a malicious campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell process events, including command-line arguments that bypass execution policies and create\/delete files, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are all related to powershell.exe accessing and loading images. Specifically, it's loading various DLL files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET framework components that PowerShell might need when executing scripts or commands. So, at face value, these don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory with a somewhat unusual name: __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. PowerShell often creates temporary files when running scripts, especially if they're testing something or compiling code on the fly. This could be normal script execution.\n\nBut then, immediately after creating that file, there's an event indicating it was deleted. File creation and deletion in a short time might suggest something malicious, like dropping a payload and then deleting it to avoid detection. However, I should consider if this is part of a legitimate process. Sometimes scripts do create temporary files, execute them, and then delete them as part of their normal operation.\n\nLooking further, there's another file created in the same user's AppData Local directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This path seems related to PowerShell profile data, which is usually non-malicious and used for customizations or configurations. So this might be part of standard operations.\n\nOne event stands out: \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any associated file or process information beyond powershell.exe. This could indicate that PowerShell is being used to run commands over the network, which in itself isn't malicious but can be a vector for attacks if not properly controlled. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this together, while some actions like creating and deleting temporary files could raise flags, they might also be part of legitimate script execution. The use of remote command execution is notable but doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity on its own. The events don't show signs of known attack patterns or anomalies beyond the usual PowerShell activity. Therefore, I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly interesting from a security standpoint, but there's some uncertainty given the potential for abuse with remote commands.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell operations including loading DLLs and creating\/deleting temporary files, which are typical behaviors. There is no evidence of malicious activities or anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
