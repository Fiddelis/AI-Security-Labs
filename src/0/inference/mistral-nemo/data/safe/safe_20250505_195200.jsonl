This is typical behavior for Office applications to improve performance when working with large datasets or offline.\n\n2. **Created JavaScript Files**: The logs show that multiple JavaScript files are being created in this cache folder.

However, the duplication might indicate an issue.\n\n- **Potential Issue**: If these duplicated files are causing performance issues or leading to unexpected behaviors in your Office application, it might be worth looking into why they're being created twice and how to prevent this from happening.\n\n- **Office Version**: The version of Microsoft Office you're using could also play a role here. Updating to the latest version (if feasible) could potentially resolve any issues related to these JavaScript files.\n\n- **Antivirus Software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with certain application functions and cause unexpected behavior like this. If your antivirus software is set to scan Office applications in real-time, that might be causing these duplicates.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, you could:\n\n1. Check the file sizes and modification dates to confirm if they're indeed identical.\n2. Try renaming or deleting the duplicated files (after taking a backup) to see if Excel recreates them with the correct version.\n3. Monitor Excel's behavior after updating your Office suite or disabling your antivirus software temporarily (if appropriate)."}

The `<hash>` part seems to be a unique identifier for each file.\n\nHere's what we can infer from this:\n\n1. **Process Involvement**: The \"SDXHelper.exe\" process is responsible for creating these files. You might want to investigate what this process does and if it's supposed to create so many files repeatedly.\n\n2. **File Content**: Since the files are JavaScript files, they likely contain script code related to Office and AI copilot functionalities.\n\n3. **Offline Files**: The directory \"OfflineFiles\" suggests that these files might be used when certain Office features are used in offline mode.\n\n4. **Frequency of File Creation**: Based on the log provided, it seems like these files are being created frequently (every few seconds or so). This could potentially lead to disk space issues over time.\n\n5. **Potential Issue**: If this file creation is not intended or necessary, and if the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is using a significant amount of CPU or other system resources, it might be indicative of a software bug or malware activity.\n\nTo address this:\n\n- You could try to identify why so many files are being created and if they're needed.\n- Check if there's any ongoing software update or installation that could be causing this.\n- If the behavior is unwanted, you might want to consider reaching out to Microsoft support (if it's a Microsoft Office process) or running a malware scan (if it's an unfamiliar process).\n- You could also try ending the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process task (via Task Manager), but please be aware that this could temporarily disrupt Office functionality."}

Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Duplicate Files**: The same file is being created multiple times, which might indicate that there's an issue with how the software is handling these files. You might want to check if there's any error or exception thrown during this process.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.exe**: This process (belonging to Microsoft Office) seems to be responsible for creating these files. You might want to investigate why it's repeatedly trying to create these files.\n\n3. **Folder Permissions**: It could also be a permissions issue where the software doesn't have write access to the OfflineFiles folder, causing it to fail and retry.\n\n4. **Antivirus Software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with file creation if it mistakenly flags the operation as malicious.\n\nTo troubleshoot this:\n\n- Check Event Viewer logs for any errors or warnings related to these files.\n- Inspect the OfflineFiles folder permissions.\n- Temporarily disable your antivirus software to see if that's causing the issue.\n- Reinstall Microsoft Office (if applicable) and check if the problem persists.\n- If possible, reach out to Microsoft Support for further assistance."}
