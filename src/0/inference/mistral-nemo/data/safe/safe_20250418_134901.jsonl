This is unusual as Calculator typically doesn't interact with the registry.\n\n   - **File Creation by setup.exe:**\n     - `setup.exe` created a temporary file (`b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`) in `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp`, which is normal behavior for installer applications.\n\n   - **Dns Query by chrome.exe:**\n     - Chrome performing a DNS query could indicate normal internet browsing activity, or it could potentially indicate malicious behavior if the query is related to known malicious domains or IP addresses.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check if there are any unknown or malicious files\/domains\/URLs referenced in these logs.\n- Review the registry changes made by `Calculator.exe` and other processes for any signs of unauthorized modification.\n- Monitor Chrome's activities for any unexpected behavior or patterns."}
