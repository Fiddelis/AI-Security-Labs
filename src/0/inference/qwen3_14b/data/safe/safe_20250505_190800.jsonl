{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple file creation events related to winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. The winlogbeat.yml.new file is being created twice, which might be normal if it's part of a configuration process. However, there's also a file named teste.ps1 created in the Downloads folder. PowerShell scripts can be dangerous if they're executing malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events for PowerShell, which is expected since it's a legitimate process. But the presence of multiple registry value set events from PowerShell and other processes like mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE could indicate some changes in the system's configuration. The registry modifications themselves aren't necessarily bad, but combined with the file creations and PowerShell activity, it raises a flag.\n\nAnother point is the execution of a PowerShell script with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which is often used to run scripts without the usual restrictions. This could be a sign of an attempted attack, especially if the script is downloaded from an untrusted source. The fact that the script is named teste.ps1 and placed in the Downloads directory might be benign, but the combination with the other events makes me cautious.\n\nI should also check if there are any unusual processes or unexpected file paths. The files being loaded like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. However, the repeated Provider Lifecycle events might indicate something's wrong, but they could just be part of normal PowerShell operations.\n\nOverall, the key suspicious elements are the creation of the PowerShell script, the use of Bypass execution policy, and the registry changes. While some events are normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to flag for closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including script creation (teste.ps1), execution with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, and registry modifications combined with file operations suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event is a Process accessed, which might be normal, but then there are several ImageLoaded events. The files loaded here include some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them might be normal if PowerShell is running a script that uses .NET. However, I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nWait, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably okay. But then there's a FileCreated event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That sounds like it could be part of a script execution. Then, immediately after, there's a FileDelete event for the same file. Deleting a temporary file might be normal, but maybe it's trying to hide evidence? Or maybe it's just a cleanup.\n\nAnother FileCreated event is for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That might be related to PowerShell's startup profiles, which could be legitimate. Then there's a Registry value set event, but no file info here. The last event is a Remote Command execution, but the process is null. That's a bit suspicious. If the process is null, maybe the event is incomplete or there's an issue with logging. But the task says \"Execute a Remote Command,\" which could be a red flag if it's unauthorized.\n\nPutting this all together: PowerShell is loading several .NET DLLs, which is normal for some operations. However, the presence of a temporary script file being created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to execute a script and then remove it. The remote command execution event adds another layer of concern. But I need to consider if these are all legitimate activities. For example, PowerShell might be used by legitimate software, but the combination of these events could also be indicative of a malicious script trying to run and clean up traces.\n\nThe confidence here might be around 0.65. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the combination of the events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the sequence of file creation and deletion, along with remote command execution, suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes loading .NET framework DLLs (normal for some operations) but also creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest...), which may indicate obfuscation or cleanup after execution.
