Then, there's an ImageLoaded event for the same executable. That seems normal for a setup file.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for Update.exe in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a common framework for updating apps, so this might be part of a legitimate update process. Then, Update.exe is created as a process, and several ImageLoaded events follow, including system DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, which is standard for many applications.\n\nHowever, I notice that the Update.exe is creating files in the AppData\\Local\\Discord directory, which is typical for Discord installations. But there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. ProcessAccess can indicate that another process is interacting with Update.exe, which might be normal during an update, but if there are too many, it could be a red flag. However, in this case, the events don't show any suspicious activity like unauthorized access or unexpected processes interacting with Update.exe.\n\nWait, but looking at the command line for Update.exe, it's running with --install . which is part of Squirrel's update process. That's normal. The loaded DLLs are all legitimate .NET components. The FileCreate events are creating necessary files for the application. The ProcessAccess events might be part of the update process, but without more context, like if another process is accessing it unexpectedly, it's hard to tell.

The majority of the events are about ProcessAccess with Update.exe. But then there are two FileCreate events where Update.exe creates a Discord.lnk file in the Desktop and another in the Start Menu. Also, Discord.exe is loading several DLLs from its installation directory.\n\nWait, but is this suspicious? Well, Update.exe could be a legitimate updater, but if it's creating shortcuts to Discord, maybe that's part of a normal update process. However, the repetition of ProcessAccess events might indicate something. But maybe it's just a lot of normal activity. The Discord-related image loads seem normal too, as those are typical DLLs for a graphics application.\n\nBut then, why are there so many ProcessAccess events for Update.exe? If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's just doing a lot of operations. However, the combination of creating shortcuts and accessing processes might be part of a malicious activity, like installing a backdoor or modifying the system. However, without more context, like network activity or unusual file modifications, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple FileCreate events for shortcuts could be part of a legitimate setup, but it's also a common tactic in malware to create shortcuts for persistence.\n\nBut the justification here is that the logs don't show clear malicious activity. The events are mostly about process access and file creation, which can be normal. The Discord DLLs are legitimate. The only thing that stands out is the multiple FileCreate events for Discord.lnk, but that alone isn't necessarily malicious.

That's a .NET DLL, and it's in the Windows directory. Hmm, maybe normal, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate files. But I need more info.\n\nThen there are several entries about Discord.exe. They mention process creation, image loading, pipe creation. The command lines look like normal Discord processes, with typical parameters. But wait, there's also some image loads for ffmpeg.dll. Is that normal? Discord might use ffmpeg for some features, but I'm not sure. Could be benign.\n\nBut then there's Update.exe creating files in the Start Menu Programs folder, specifically a Discord.lnk shortcut. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but if Update.exe is doing it, maybe that's part of a legitimate update process. However, the fact that Update.exe is involved in multiple file creations and process accesses might be a red flag. Also, the repetition of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe could indicate some ongoing activity that's not typical.\n\nWait, the first event was Update.exe loading a .NET DLL. Then later, Update.exe is creating files. But is there any indication that these are malicious? Maybe if Update.exe is not a known legitimate process. However, Update.exe could be part of an update mechanism. But the presence of multiple events related to Update.exe might be suspicious, especially if there's no clear reason for it.\n\nAnother point: the Discord.exe processes have multiple image loads, including the main executable and ffmpeg.dll. If those files are from the official Discord installation, that's normal. But if the paths are different or if there are unexpected files, that's a problem. However, in the logs provided, the paths seem to be the standard installation directories.\n\nBut then, the fact that Update.exe is creating a shortcut in the Start Menu and also accessing the process multiple times might be part of a legitimate update. However, the combination of these events with the initial loading of clrjit.dll by Update.exe could be something to look into. Maybe the Update.exe is a legitimate updater, but the repetition of events might indicate something else.\n\nAlternatively, if Update.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a problem. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of multiple events involving Update.exe, including file creation and process access, might be worth investigating further.

The first thing I notice is that Update.exe is being accessed multiple times, which might be normal if it's part of a legitimate update process. But then there's a File created event where a Discord.lnk shortcut is created on the desktop. That could be suspicious if it's not expected, but maybe it's just a user placing a shortcut there.\n\nThen there's a Process terminated event for Update.exe, which is okay. But the real red flags start with the reg.exe commands. There are several registry modifications. The first one adds Discord to the Run key, pointing to Update.exe with a parameter to start Discord.exe. That's a common technique for persistence, making the malware run every time the user logs in. \n\nThen there are entries adding a registry key for Discord under Software\\Classes, which is related to URL protocols. This could be setting up a custom protocol handler, which might be used to trick users into clicking on malicious links. \n\nThe repeated Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might indicate inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the registry changes, it could be part of a larger malicious activity. \n\nThe fact that reg.exe is being used to modify the registry in multiple places suggests someone is trying to establish persistence and possibly modify how the system handles certain protocols. The combination of these registry changes and the creation of a shortcut might be part of an installation or a setup that's not entirely legitimate. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these events could be from a legitimate application. Discord does have an installer, and it's possible that these are part of a normal installation process. But the frequency of the events and the specific registry keys being modified make me lean towards this being suspicious. \n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because without more context, like the source of the processes or network activity, it's hard to be certain.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Discord.exe creating a pipe. That's normal for communication between processes, maybe part of the application's regular operations. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's reg.exe adding a registry key for Discord's DefaultIcon. That seems like a legitimate action if Discord is setting up its icon. But wait, the command line shows it's modifying the registry under HKCU. Maybe that's part of installation or configuration. But why is reg.exe being used here? It's a standard tool, so not necessarily bad.\n\nNext, multiple entries of Discord.exe being accessed and terminated. The process being terminated multiple times could be normal, like closing the app, but repeated terminations might be worth looking into. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the Update.exe events. There's an image loaded from urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows, so that's normal. But then Update.exe is creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. That's typical during installation. However, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. Maybe it's accessing files or resources, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nWait, the command line for Discord.exe includes \"--squirrel-firstrun\". Squirrel is a framework used for Windows app updates. So this might be part of an update process. That's legitimate, but sometimes malware uses similar names. However, the presence of Squirrel is common in legitimate apps.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe. If this is part of normal operation, like communication with other components, it's okay. But if there's an unusual number of pipes, that could be a sign of something else. However, the logs don't show any errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nThe registry modifications by reg.exe are part of setting up the application's associations, which is normal during installation. The file created by Update.exe is a shortcut, which is standard.\n\nBut wait, there's also an ImageLoad event for ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is a multimedia framework, and if Discord uses it, that's fine. But if it's being loaded from an unexpected location, that could be a red flag. However, the path here is in the user's AppData, which is common for installed applications.\n\nPutting this all together: most of these events seem related to the installation or update process of Discord. The use of reg.exe and Update.exe is part of that. However, the repetition of certain events (like multiple Pipe Created and Process terminated) might be normal for an update. But I need to check if there's any deviation from typical behavior.\n\nIs there any indication of unauthorized access or unexpected modifications? The registry changes are under HKCU, which is the current user's hive. If this is part of a legitimate installation, that's fine. But if the user didn't initiate an update, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't provide context on user actions.\n\nAnother point: the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. If Update.exe is accessing files or processes that aren't related to its intended function, that could be a problem. But without knowing what those accesses are, it's hard to tell. The logs don't specify which files or processes are being accessed, just that access occurred.\n\nOverall, while some events might look unusual in isolation, when considered as a whole, they seem to align with the behavior of a legitimate application during installation or update. However, the classification as \"INTERESTING\" might be considered if there's a possibility that these actions could be part of a more complex attack, especially if the user didn't authorize the update. But based solely on the logs provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. However, the presence of reg.exe modifying registry keys and Update.exe creating shortcuts could be seen as part of a legitimate process. \n\nWait, but the confidence level is a factor here. If the system is expecting an update, this is normal. But if it's unexpected, maybe not. Since the logs don't provide user context, it's ambiguous. However, the classification is based on the logs alone. Given that the events are consistent with application updates and installations, even though some events are repetitive, they might not be interesting. But the initial thought was that it's not interesting. However, the presence of multiple Pipe Created events and Process terminations might be worth looking into. But I think the answer is that it's not interesting because it's normal application behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events align with legitimate Discord application behavior, including registry modifications during installation, process creation\/termination, and normal pipe communication.

There are multiple entries where the task is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" and \"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\". Also, there's a \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and a \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" event where a Discord.lnk file is created on the desktop. \n\nNow, the key here is that all these events are related to Update.exe. Normally, an update executable might be legitimate, like part of a software update. However, the repetition of ProcessAccess events could indicate that the process is being monitored or maybe even manipulated. But wait, if it's a legitimate update, why so many accesses? That might be normal if the update is performing multiple operations, but it's worth checking.\n\nThen there's the file creation of Discord.lnk. That's a shortcut file. Creating a shortcut isn't inherently malicious, but if it's done by an update process, maybe it's part of a larger action. However, the rest of the logs also show Discord.exe activities, like process creation, image loading, and DNS queries. The presence of Discord.exe seems normal, as it's a legitimate application. But the command line for Discord.exe includes some parameters that might be unusual, like --url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e. That looks like a placeholder or fake URL, which could be a red flag. \n\nAlso, the registry value being set by Update.exe might be something benign, but combined with the other events, it's possible that Update.exe is doing more than just updating. The fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events could indicate that the process is being accessed frequently, perhaps by other processes or maybe even by malware trying to interact with it.\n\nHowever, the presence of legitimate processes like Discord.exe and the normal activities (like creating a shortcut, DNS queries) might mean that this is just regular user activity. But the repetition of events and the fake URL in the command line are suspicious. \n\nAnother point is that the user might be trying to install or update Discord, but the Update.exe is involved. If Update.exe is part of the Discord installation, that's normal. But if it's a different application's update, then maybe not. However, the logs don't specify the source of Update.exe, which is a concern. \n\nPutting it all together: the batch has a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, they all involve Discord.exe. There are multiple process creation events, process access, image loads, and a pipe created event. The command lines for the processes seem normal, with typical parameters like --type=gpu-process, --user-data-dir, etc. These are common for applications like Discord that use various processes for different tasks.\n\nNow, checking the file paths. The image loads are pointing to legitimate files within the Discord installation directory, such as ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, libGLESv2.dll, etc. These are standard libraries that Discord might use for multimedia or GPU-related functions. The presence of these files doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual activity. For example, multiple process creations and image loads might be normal for a running application, but if there's an unexpected number or unusual parameters, that could be a red flag. In this case, the command lines have typical arguments, and the files are all within the expected directories for Discord.\n\nAnother point is the Pipe Created event. While pipes can be used for legitimate inter-process communication, they can also be exploited. But since all other events are related to Discord and no other suspicious processes or files are mentioned, this might just be part of Discord's normal operations.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern of repeated events that might indicate a loop or unexpected behavior. The logs show several ImageLoad events for the same DLLs, which is normal during application startup or when different components are loaded.\n\nNo signs of malware or unauthorized access are present here.

Normally, a legitimate application like Discord might have some process interactions, but so many access events could be suspicious. \n\nThen, another File created event in the AppData directory for another Discord.lnk. That's a common place for shortcuts, but creating multiple shortcuts might be part of normal operations, but maybe not. \n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, multiple instances might be a red flag. \n\nThe most interesting part is the reg.exe event. The command line shows that reg.exe is adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with the value \"URL:Discord Protocol\". This is a classic sign of a malicious payload trying to create a protocol handler, which can be used to execute code when a user clicks on a URL like discord:\/\/something. This is often seen in malware to maintain persistence or execute arbitrary code.\n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are from Discord.exe, which is a legitimate application, but the presence of reg.exe modifying the registry to create a protocol handler is suspicious. Even though there are many ProcessAccess events, they might be part of normal operations. However, the registry modification is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

The command line for one of the Discord processes includes parameters like --type=utility and --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper. Unzipping could be part of normal operations, but sometimes malicious software uses similar techniques to extract payloads.\n\nThere are several network connections and DNS queries. While Discord is a legitimate app that communicates over the network, the high number of connections might indicate something unusual. However, it's also possible that this is just normal background activity for the application.\n\nThe image load events show that Discord.exe is loading ffmpeg.dll and Google.Widevine.CDM.dll. Widevine is a legitimate DRM component, but the presence of these files in the Temp directory might be a red flag. If they were installed in a standard location, that's fine, but Temp is a temporary area, which could suggest that something is being unpacked or executed from there.\n\nThe user name is fiddelis, which doesn't stand out.

Since Discord is a known application, these activities might be normal. However, the high frequency of NetworkConnect events might be unusual. But without more context, like the destination IPs or if there are other anomalies, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are all from a legitimate process, and there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The justification would be that the events are consistent with normal Discord operations, even though the frequency is high. Confidence is around 0.7 because while it's mostly normal, the repeated network connections could be a red flag, but without more info, it's safer to assume it's legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate Discord.exe process activities (network connections, process termination, registry updates), which are consistent with normal application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
