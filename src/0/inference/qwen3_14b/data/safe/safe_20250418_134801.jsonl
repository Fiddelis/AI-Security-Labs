{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Microsoft Edge is creating a file in the Program Files directory under EdgeUpdate. The file is setup.exe. Then, the creation time is changed. That might be normal during an update, but I should check if there are any other unusual activities.\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so loading that is normal. MpOAV.dll is also related to Windows Defender, so that's probably okay. But maybe if these were from unexpected locations, but the paths here are standard.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event for setup.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple User Account Management events. A lot of them, which might indicate some automated process or script running, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nThe PowerShell command line is interesting. It's checking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That might be part of a legitimate process, like checking for driver installations, but sometimes attackers use similar techniques to find install sections for malicious purposes. The execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default, so that's normal. But the script itself is scanning INF files, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThen, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. However, the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be less secure. But if the user is using it, that's acceptable.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries with registry value sets are common for system services. The command line for svchost related to BthAvctpSvc is normal as well, part of Bluetooth services.\n\nOther entries include Chrome doing a DNS query, which is normal, and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer and used for URL handling. That's standard.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The most suspicious part is the PowerShell script scanning INF files. While not inherently malicious, it could be part of an attempt to find install sections for deploying malware. However, without more evidence like unexpected modifications, network activity to bad IPs, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. The rest of the events seem to be normal system activities. The repetition of User Account Management might be a red herring, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch is not highly suspicious but has a few points that need closer inspection. However, without additional context or more indicators of compromise, it's not conclusive enough to flag as interesting for investigation. So the answer would be that it's not interesting, but with some notes on the PowerShell activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system activities and benign processes, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Microsoft Edge\/Setup.exe Activity:**\n   - File creation and modification in the `Program Files` directory (`EdgeUpdate`) are consistent with legitimate software updates. No suspicious paths or unexpected behavior is noted.\n\n2. **CompatTelRunner and Defender DLLs:**\n   - Loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is standard and expected for system integrity checks.\n\n3. **PowerShell Script:**\n   - The script scans INF files for `[defaultinstall.nt...]` sections. While this could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., driver installation checks), it is not inherently malicious. The execution policy (`Restricted`) is default and safe.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - A temporary config file created in the `Downloads` directory by `winlogbeat.exe` is a normal part of log shipper configuration, even if the location is less secure.\n\n5. **Repetitive User Account Management Events:**\n   - Multiple entries for \"User Account Management\" are likely from automated system processes (e.g., service account management) and not indicative of an attack.\n\n6. **Other Benign Activity:**\n   - DNS queries by Chrome, `svchost.exe` registry updates, and `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` are all standard operations.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs do not contain **clear indicators of compromise** (e.g., suspicious network activity, unauthorized access, or anomalous file modifications). While the PowerShell script warrants closer inspection in isolation, it is not sufficient to flag the entire batch as suspicious. \n\n**Final Verdict:** ❌ **Not Interesting for Investigation** – The activity appears to be routine system behavior with no definitive evidence of malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. The first entry is Chrome setting a registry value. That's normal. Then MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender) loading taskschd.dll. Hmm, taskschd.dll is part of Task Scheduler, but why is Defender loading it? Maybe legitimate, but worth noting.\n\nNext, winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. That's part of configuration, maybe a setup. Then CompatTelRunner also loading taskschd.dll. Again, same DLL. Svchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization folders. That's part of Windows Update, so probably normal.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an Edge installer file. That's expected during an update. Then MpCmdRun.exe loading MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll. Those are Defender components, so normal. But there's a file delete logged for an Edge installer in the Temp folder. That's part of the update process, maybe cleaning up.\n\nThen conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is part of console windows, mintty is a terminal emulator. Both setting registry values could be normal, but maybe if they're doing something unusual. However, no suspicious paths here.\n\nThere's an entry with process null and task None. That might be a placeholder or error, but not necessarily malicious. The git.exe entries creating files in node_modules. That's part of cloning repositories, so normal activity.\n\nLooking for anomalies: multiple legitimate processes doing normal tasks. No unexpected network activity, no unusual file paths. The only thing slightly odd is the repeated loading of taskschd.dll by Defender, but that's not necessarily bad. No signs of malware or suspicious behavior. So overall, this looks like normal system and user activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system and user activities, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **`MsMpEng.exe` (Windows Defender)** and **`MpCmdRun.exe`** loading DLLs like `MpClient.dll` and `MpCommu.dll` are standard operations for antivirus scanning and updates.\n   - **`svchost.exe`** creating files in `DeliveryOptimization` directories is part of Windows Update\/Update management.\n   - **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`** downloading and deleting temporary installer files aligns with expected update behavior.\n\n2. **User-Driven Activities:**\n   - **`git.exe`** creating files in `node_modules` (e.g., `semver.js`, `clean.js`) is consistent with cloning repositories or installing npm packages.\n   - **`winlogbeat`** generating a `.yml.new` file suggests configuration changes, likely part of a monitored setup.\n\n3. **Registry Activity:**\n   - **`conhost.exe`** and **`mintty.exe`** setting registry values are typical for terminal emulators and console hosts. No suspicious keys or values are mentioned.\n\n4. **No Clear Anomalies:**\n   - No unexpected network connections, unusual file paths, or high-risk operations (e.g., privilege escalation, unauthorized access).\n   - The single entry with `process: null` and `task: None` may be a log placeholder or incomplete data but does not indicate a threat.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries reflect routine system operations, user activities, and legitimate software behavior. There is **no evidence of malicious activity** in the provided data. However, as with any log analysis, further context (e.g., correlation with other logs, network traffic, or user behavior) would be needed to rule out subtle threats. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Benign** – No actionable threats detected."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from the git.exe process. Each entry is about a file being created in the node_modules\/semver\/functions directory. The files have names like compare-build.js, compare-loose.js, compare.js, and so on. \n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that all these files are part of the semver package, which is a common library for handling version numbers in Node.js projects. The fact that git.exe is creating these files might be part of a normal operation, like cloning a repository or installing dependencies. But wait, why are these files being created individually? Typically, when you install a package via npm, the entire directory structure is created at once, not individual files one by one.\n\nAnother point is the path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This looks like a user's download folder, possibly part of a student project or coursework. The presence of node_modules suggests that this is a Node.js project, and semver is a dependency. However, if this is a legitimate project, why are there so many file creation events? It might be normal if the user is manually creating files, but that's not typical.\n\nWait, but git.exe is the process creating these files. Normally, git would create directories and files as part of checking out a repository. However, creating each file individually might indicate that the user is using git in a way that's not standard, or maybe there's an issue with the git operation. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate process if the user is adding files one by one, but that's unusual.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malicious activity. Could this be a sign of something like a file dropper or a malware that's creating files in the node_modules directory? However, semver is a legitimate package, so that might not be the case. But the repetitive nature of the file creations might be a red flag. However, without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: if the user is running a script that generates these files, but again, semver's functions are usually part of the package, not generated. Maybe the user is developing the semver package itself, but that's less likely. \n\nConsidering all this, it's possible that this is a normal operation if the user is manually adding files or if there's a specific reason for the individual file creations. However, the sheer number of events and the fact that all are from git.exe might indicate an unusual activity. But without additional information, it's hard to be certain. The safest conclusion is that this might be a legitimate process, but it's worth monitoring for any other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `git.exe` process is creating multiple files within the `node_modules\/semver\/functions` directory of a Node.js project. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Files**:\n   - **Process**: `git.exe` (commonly associated with Git operations like cloning or checking out repositories).\n   - **Files Created**: All files are part of the `semver` package, a standard library for parsing and comparing semantic version numbers in Node.js projects. Examples include `compare.js`, `parse.js`, and `satisfies.js`.\n\n2. **Path Context**:\n   - The files are located in a user's download directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...`), suggesting this is likely a local development environment, possibly for a student project or coursework.\n\n3. **Operation Pattern**:\n   - **Individual File Creation**: The logs show each file being created separately. This is unusual for Git, which typically creates directories and files in bulk during operations like `git clone` or `git checkout`.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - **Manual File Creation**: The user might be manually adding files to the `semver` directory (e.g., modifying or extending the package).\n  - **Custom Git Workflow**: If the user is using a non-standard Git workflow (e.g., cherry-picking files or using hooks), this could explain individual file creation.\n  - **Development of `semver` Package**: If the user is actively developing or debugging the `semver` library, this might be part of their process.\n\n- **Unusual or Suspicious Activity**:\n  - **Malicious Behavior**: While unlikely, the repetitive nature of the file creations could hint at a file dropper or malware attempting to inject files into a project. However, the files themselves are legitimate components of the `semver` package, which reduces this likelihood.\n  - **Git Misconfiguration**: A misconfigured Git client or repository could lead to unexpected file creation patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Confirm if the user is actively developing the `semver` package or modifying its files.\n   - Check for other suspicious logs (e.g., network activity, process injections, or unexpected executables).\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If the user is not intentionally modifying the `semver` directory, investigate why Git is creating files individually. This could indicate a deeper issue with the Git client or repository.\n\n3. **Security Checks**:\n   - Run antivirus\/malware scans on the system to rule out malicious activity.\n   - Ensure the `node_modules` directory is not being tampered with by unauthorized processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs are **likely legitimate**, especially in a development context where the user is working with a Node.js project and manually modifying the `semver` package. However, the unusual pattern of individual file creation by `git.exe` warrants further investigation to rule out misconfigurations or potential security risks. No immediate malicious activity is evident, but vigilance is advised. \n\n**Verdict**: **Not Suspicious (Likely Legitimate)**, but monitor for additional anomalies."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, all the events are about files being created in the node_modules\/semver directory by git.exe. The user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or install packages, it's common for git to create files. The semver package is a standard library for semantic versioning, often used in npm projects. The files listed here look like typical files you'd find in a semver package, like index.js, package.json, and various internal modules. \n\nBut wait, the task here is to determine if this is suspicious. The key point is whether the creation of these files by git.exe is normal. If the user is running a git command that's part of a legitimate workflow, like cloning a repo or pulling updates, then this is normal. However, if git.exe is creating files in a directory that's not part of a normal git operation, that could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages. The semver package is a common dependency, so it's plausible that git is part of an npm install process. However, git.exe usually doesn't create files in node_modules; that's more the role of npm or yarn. So maybe this is unusual. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is using git to manage the project, and during the process, git is creating these files. Alternatively, if the files are being created in a location that's not expected, like outside of a repository, that could be a problem. However, the path here is in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for users to store projects. \n\nAnother angle: the number of files being created. There are a lot of files here, but that's because semver has multiple files. It's not necessarily a sign of malicious activity. However, if the same process was creating a large number of files in unusual locations, that might be suspicious. \n\nI should also consider if there are any other indicators. All events are from git.exe, and the task is FileCreate. The user might be concerned if git is being used to inject files, but in this case, the files are standard. \n\nSo, the main question is: is it normal for git.exe to create these files? If the answer is yes, then it's not interesting. If not, then it's suspicious. Given that git is typically not responsible for creating node_modules contents, this might be a case of a different process (like npm) being mistaken for git, or maybe a misconfiguration. However, the logs don't show any signs of malware or unusual activity beyond the normal files. \n\nTherefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activity appears to be part of a standard git\/npm workflow, even if git.exe is creating the files. However, there's a slight uncertainty because git usually doesn't handle node_modules. But without more context, like other anomalous events or unexpected file contents, it's safer to say this is normal.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows multiple file creation operations in the `node_modules\/semver` directory, all attributed to `git.exe`. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Normal File Types**: The files created (e.g., `index.js`, `package.json`, `ranges\/*.js`) are typical for a standard `semver` npm package, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects for semantic versioning.\n\n2. **git.exe as the Source**: While `git.exe` is a legitimate tool, it is not typically responsible for creating files within `node_modules`. This is usually handled by package managers like `npm` or `yarn`. However, if the user is running a `git` command (e.g., `git submodule` or `git clone`) that interacts with a repository containing `semver` as a submodule, this could be a legitimate scenario.\n\n3. **Directory Context**: The files are located in the `Downloads` folder, which is a common location for user-initiated projects. This does not inherently raise suspicion unless there is a lack of user context (e.g., unexpected activity in a restricted directory).\n\n4. **No Anomalies Detected**: There are no signs of unusual file content, unexpected process behavior, or deviations from standard workflows (e.g., no suspicious file names, no network activity, no privilege escalation).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity appears to be **legitimate** and part of a standard development workflow (e.g., cloning a repository or managing submodules). While the involvement of `git.exe` in creating `node_modules` files is atypical, it is not inherently malicious in this context. \n\n**Classification:** **NOT INTERESTING**  \n**Confidence:** High  \n**Reason:** The file types, directory structure, and lack of anomalies align with normal development workflows. No indicators of compromise are present."}

The files are standard ones like package.json, index.js, license, readme.md, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is suspicious. Normally, git.exe is part of Git for Windows, used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, git.exe might create or modify files. The fact that these files are in node_modules suggests that this is part of a project's dependencies, which are typically managed by npm or yarn. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be part of standard npm package structures. Each package has its own directory with common files like package.json, license, and README. The presence of multiple packages (strip-json-comments, supports-color, tcomb-validation, tcomb) is normal when installing dependencies.\n\nNow, are there any red flags? The process is git.exe, which is legitimate. The files created are typical for a Git repository and npm packages. There's no mention of any unusual activity, like downloading from suspicious sources, executing scripts, or modifying system files. All the events are about file creation, which is expected during a Git clone or pull.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of malicious activity. For example, if git.exe was being used to download and execute malicious code. But in these logs, there's no indication of that. The files are standard, and the process is legitimate. \n\nAnother angle: the user might be in a student environment (given the folder name \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), so installing dependencies as part of a project is normal. The repetition of FileCreate events is expected during such operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't show any signs of malicious behavior. They are part of normal software development activities. Therefore, the classification should be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent standard file creation operations by git.exe during dependency installation in a software project.

When you clone a repository or pull changes, Git creates files as part of the normal process. The path here is in the Downloads folder under a course directory, which suggests this might be part of a student's project.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they all seem to be standard files for a Node.js package, specifically the tcomb library, which is a TypeScript type checking library. The presence of multiple files in the lib directory is consistent with how such packages are structured. \n\nSince all events are from git.exe and the files are part of a legitimate package, this seems like normal activity. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as files being created in unexpected locations, or processes other than git.exe involved. No errors or failed attempts are mentioned here either. \n\nTherefore, this batch of events doesn't show any signs of malicious activity.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, all from the git.exe process creating various files in the tcomb library under node_modules. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what typical malicious activities look like. Malicious behavior often involves unexpected file creation, especially in directories that aren't part of normal operations. However, git.exe is a legitimate process used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, git creates files as part of normal operation. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the node_modules directory, which is common in JavaScript projects for storing dependencies. The files being created are part of the tcomb library, which is a legitimate package. The filenames like dict.js, enums.js, etc., seem to be standard source files for a library.\n\nNow, considering the number of events. There are multiple entries, but they're all from git.exe and part of the same directory structure. This could indicate a normal git operation, like initializing a repo or pulling updates. However, if these files were created in a different context, like outside of a project directory or by an unexpected process, that would be a red flag. \n\nBut in this case, since all the events are from git.exe and the files are in the expected location (node_modules), it's likely part of a normal development workflow. There's no indication of unusual activity here. The classification should be NOT INTERESTING because the events align with typical git operations.
