So, first, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some package resources. There are several entries for the same files, maybe duplicates or multiple creations.\n\nThen there's one event that's different: a Security Group Management task with no process or file info. And another one from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. \n\nHmm. SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft tool related to Office, so creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal, like part of an update or installation. But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. However, maybe it's just the same file being created in different steps. Also, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might be part of versioning.\n\nThe Security Group Management event is a bit out of place. If there's no process or file involved, it might be a system event, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The winlogbeat event is probably a legitimate activity since winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating a config file makes sense. \n\nBut the main thing here is that all these file creations are from SDXHelper.exe. If that process is legitimate, then it's probably normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously here, maybe the files are part of a payload. But the filenames suggest they're part of Office's resources. \n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malware, like unusual process names or paths outside typical directories. The repetition might be normal, like multiple components being installed. The confidence here is a bit low because there's no clear malicious activity, but the repeated file creations could be worth investigating. So maybe \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if all these are part of a legitimate Office update, then it's not interesting. But without more context, it's hard. The presence of multiple same files might indicate something, but I'm not certain.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the entries to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths are all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're JavaScript files with hashes in them, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a long string. Hmm, those hashes might be unique identifiers for different versions or packages.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe â€“ I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's a legitimate process related to some software installation or update. However, the fact that it's creating multiple files in a short period might be suspicious. But wait, looking at the timestamps, are these all happening at once or spread out? The user didn't provide timestamps, so I can't tell the timing. But the repetition of the same file being created multiple times might indicate something. Wait, no, looking at the paths, each entry has a different hash in the filename. So each is a different file. But why so many?\n\nAlso, there are two entries where svchost.exe and chrome.exe loaded BitsProxy.dll. BitsProxy.dll is part of the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), which is a legitimate Windows component. However, if an unexpected process is loading it, that could be a red flag. But in this case, svchost.exe and chrome.exe are both legitimate processes. Chrome using BitsProxy might be for updates, and svchost is a common host process for Windows services. So maybe that's normal.\n\nBack to the SDXHelper.exe files. The fact that multiple files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory might be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the presence of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" suggests it's related to Office AI Copilot, which is a newer feature. If this is a recent update, maybe it's normal. But if the user hasn't installed that feature, or if the files are being created in an unusual way, that could be a problem.\n\nBut the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity beyond the file creations. The process is SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's a third-party tool or part of some software. However, without more context, like the process's parent or its behavior beyond creating files, it's hard to say. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files in the same directory might be part of a legitimate package deployment, but it's also possible that it's maliciously dropping files.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have min_ followed by a hash. That's common in minified JavaScript files, which are typical in web apps. If this is part of an Office add-in or feature, maybe it's okay. But if the files are being created in a user's AppData directory, that's a common place for legitimate software too.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be a sign of something. But again, without more context, like if the process is known to be malicious or if there are other anomalous events (like network connections, registry changes), it's hard to tell. The logs here only show file creation and image loading events.\n\nConsidering all that, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might be normal if it's part of an installation. But since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should consider if there's any suspicious pattern. The fact that all the files are in the same directory and created by the same process could be benign, but it's also possible that it's part of a larger attack. However, without more data (like process arguments, user context, or other logs), I can't be certain.\n\nSo, maybe the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there's a high volume of file creations by an unfamiliar process in a specific location. However, the confidence might be moderate, around 0.6, because there's not enough information to confirm malicious intent, but the pattern is unusual enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with similar names (officeaicopilot-strings.min_*) are being created in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe, which may indicate unusual or potentially malicious activity related to Office add-ins or package deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each entry is about a file being created in the same directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are all named similarly, with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a long hash.\n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office, right? It's used for some kind of package management or installation. But why are there so many files being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory? The names of the files have different hash values, which might be unique identifiers for different versions or resources.\n\nWait, but all these events are the same process creating files in the same location. That seems a bit odd. Normally, if a legitimate process is creating files, there might be some variation in the files or the times they're created. However, here, the same file paths are repeated multiple times. Wait, no, looking again, each entry has a slightly different hash in the filename. So each file is unique but follows the same naming pattern.\n\nBut why so many? Could this be part of a normal update or installation? Maybe the Office application is deploying resources, and these files are part of that. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory might be a red flag. Also, the fact that all these files are JavaScript files (.js) might be relevant. If these are legitimate resources, they might be part of the Office app's localization or some embedded scripts. However, if they're being created in a directory that's typically for offline resources, maybe they're being used for something else.\n\nAnother angle: the use of hash values in the filenames. That's common in software distribution for versioning. But if this is a malicious process, the hashes could be part of obfuscation. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. But maybe it's been compromised. However, the events here don't show any other suspicious activity, like network connections or registry changes. They just show file creation.\n\nBut the key point is that multiple files are being created by the same process in a short period. If this is part of a normal installation, it might be expected. However, if the system is not undergoing an installation or update, this could be unusual. Since the user hasn't provided other context, like whether an update was recently performed, I have to rely on the logs alone.\n\nAnother thing: the files are in the OfflineFiles directory. That might be part of Office's setup for offline use, but again, the number of files created here seems high. Maybe this is a false positive, or maybe it's a legitimate process. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory with multiple files might be worth investigating further. Especially since the hashes are different each time, which could indicate that each file is a different resource, but the same process is responsible for creating them all.\n\nBut considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, and the files are in a known directory for Microsoft Office, this might not be malicious. However, the sheer number of files created might be unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The classification here would depend on whether this is a known normal behavior or not.

Microsoft Office might use that directory for storing solution packages. But why are there so many files being created? The same file path is repeated multiple times, but maybe each entry is a separate creation event. Wait, but the same file being created multiple times could be a red flag. However, in the logs, each event seems to be for a different file with a different hash. So maybe those are different files, but all under the same package.\n\nAnother thing to note is the process involved. SDXHelper.exe is the one creating these files. I should check if that's a legitimate process. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office, specifically related to the Office Add-in Debugger. So, if this process is creating files in the expected directory, it might be normal. However, the number of files being created might be higher than usual. \n\nBut wait, the logs have multiple entries for the same file. Wait, no, looking again, each entry has a different hash. So each is a different file. But why so many? Maybe it's part of an update or installation process. However, the fact that they're all JavaScript files named with \"officeaicopilot\" might indicate something. Office AI Copilot is a feature in Office 365, so maybe these are part of that. But the minified JavaScript could be part of a legitimate package.\n\nThere are also two events related to chrome.exe setting registry values, but those don't seem directly related to the file creations. Maybe those are separate issues, but the main focus here is on the SDXHelper.exe activities.\n\nNow, considering if this is suspicious. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in that directory, it could be normal if it's part of an Office update. However, the repetition and the large number of files might be unusual. But without more context, like other events or indicators of compromise, it's hard to tell. The hashes in the filenames could be legitimate, but they might also be used by malware to obfuscate names. However, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is legitimate, so unless there's a known issue with that process, it might be okay.\n\nBut the user's task is to determine if the batch is interesting. Since all the events are from a legitimate process creating files in a legitimate directory, and there's no obvious malicious activity like execution of scripts, network connections, or unexpected process behaviors, this might not be interesting. However, the high volume of file creations could be a sign of something. But given that the process is known and the files are in the expected location, maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nWait, but why are there so many files? Maybe it's a normal part of the Office solution package setup. If the user is using Office 365, these could be part of the AI Copilot feature being installed or updated. In that case, the events are normal. However, if this is happening in a short period and the files are numerous, it might be worth checking. But without more context, the classification here would depend on whether the behavior is typical for SDXHelper.exe.\n\nSince the justification requires a concise explanation, and the confidence is a float, I need to weigh the possibilities. The fact that all events are from a legitimate process in a legitimate location, even though there are many files, might not be interesting.

Microsoft Office does have some helper executables, but I should verify if this is one of them. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a short period might be suspicious. Also, the filenames have hashes in them, which could be part of a legitimate update process, but sometimes malware uses similar naming conventions to blend in.\n\nLooking at the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. Wait, some entries have the same file paths repeated. For example, the first two entries have different files, but then the third entry is the same as the second. Wait, no, looking again, each entry has a different hash in the filename. Wait, no, actually, each entry has a unique hash. Wait, let me check again.

But the same file being created multiple times might be normal if it's part of a setup process, but maybe not. However, the main point is that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nNow, considering that these files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory.

But without knowing if SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files in a SolutionPackages directory might be part of a legitimate Office solution, but it's also possible that this is malicious. \n\nConsidering that the justification needs to be concise, the key points are: multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office directory, with filenames that include hashes.

Since all events are the same type (file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific path), and there's no clear indication of malicious activity beyond the volume of files, it might be considered \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there's a known bad actor.

But if the system is generating these logs correctly, then maybe the process is creating the same file multiple times, which could be a sign of something wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the logs are just being duplicated by mistake. But assuming the logs are accurate, the repetition of the same file creation events could indicate that the process is being run multiple times, which might be normal during an installation. However, if this is part of a malicious activity, like dropping files, the repetition might be a sign of persistence or evasion techniques. \n\nBut SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. So unless there's evidence that this instance is malicious (like unexpected behavior or unusual command-line arguments), it's hard to say. The logs don't show any other processes or anomalous activities. The only thing here is the creation of these JS files. \n\nHowever, the presence of multiple files with similar names in the OfflineFiles folder might be part of a legitimate update. But I should also consider that Office's SolutionPackages are used for add-ins, and if this is a third-party add-in, it's possible. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe key here is that the classification should be based on whether the events are indicative of malicious behavior. Since all the events are from a legitimate process in a legitimate location, and there's no other suspicious activity mentioned, it might not be interesting. But the repetition of the same events could be a sign of something wrong. However, without more data, like process arguments, parent processes, or other related events, it's hard to confirm. \n\nSo, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and the files are in a known location, even though there are many files created, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. But I'm a bit uncertain because of the repetition. However, the confidence level would be moderate, maybe around 0.6, since there's no clear malicious intent but the repetition is unusual.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a standard Office SolutionPackages directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. There are multiple entries for the same files being created, but they might just be duplicates or multiple events from the same action.\n\nThen, there's an event where chrome.exe sets a registry value, and another where it loads urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. The registry event might be normal, but the image loads are standard system DLLs, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for some Office solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory could be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate something. Wait, looking at the file paths, the hashes in the filenames are different each time. That might be normal if they're different versions or different files. But why are they all being created by SDXHelper.exe?\n\nWait, the user is asking if this is interesting. The key here is whether these events are indicative of malicious behavior. If SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in a non-standard way, that could be a red flag. But if it's part of a legitimate Office package deployment, then it's normal. However, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same files might not be significant if they're just multiple events from the same process. But the same file being created multiple times could be a sign of something else.\n\nAnother point: the files are all .js files. If they're part of a legitimate Office add-in or package, that's okay. But if they're being created in a user's AppData folder and not part of a known package, that might be suspicious. However, the path includes SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office solutions. So maybe this is legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the name \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" might be related to Microsoft's AI Copilot feature. If that's a new feature, then the files could be part of an update. But if the files are being created in a way that's not standard, or if there are other suspicious events, that's a different story.\n\nLooking at the other events, chrome.exe loading standard DLLs isn't suspicious. The registry event might be normal. So the main focus is on the SDXHelper.exe activity. However, the repetition of the same file creation events might not be enough to flag as interesting unless there's a pattern that's not typical. Alternatively, if the files are being created in a directory that's not supposed to have user-generated files, that could be a problem.\n\nBut given that the files are in the SolutionPackages directory, which is part of Office's structure, and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, this might be a normal activity. However, the fact that there are so many entries (multiple same files) might indicate something. Wait, no, looking again, each entry has different hashes in the filenames. So each is a different file. So maybe it's just a lot of files being created as part of a package deployment.\n\nIn that case, this might not be interesting. However, if the user is concerned about SDXHelper.exe creating files in unexpected locations, but here it's in a known Office directory. So perhaps this is not suspicious. But I should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. If it's part of a legitimate process, then it's not interesting. But if there's a possibility that the files are malicious, but the names suggest they're just string resources, maybe minified JavaScript, which could be part of a legitimate package.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the batch is not interesting. But I need to be cautious. However, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate directory might not be a concern. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence, as there's no clear sign of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate SDXHelper.exe file creation in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Defender might load its own files, but I should check if the DLL path is legitimate. The path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. That looks like a standard Defender path, so maybe it's benign.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. SDXHelper.exe is part of Office, right? But creating multiple JavaScript files with different hashes might be unusual. Maybe it's part of an update or installation, but the repetition of the same file creation could indicate something else. However, the paths are within the Office directory, which might be legitimate.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. That's common for browsers, but if it's doing it excessively, it might be a red flag. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious registry changes, just the task being RegistryEvent. Without more context on what's being changed, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a file stream created for a downloaded Excel file, Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. Chrome creating streams for the file and its Zone.Identifier is normal when handling downloaded files. Zone.Identifier is used to mark files as coming from the internet, so that's expected.\n\nA DNS query from chrome.exe is also normal, as browsers frequently query DNS.\n\nThe repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe might be part of Office's normal operations, like loading resources. However, the same file being created multiple times with different hashes could be suspicious. But since the files are in the Office directory and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, it might be legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of events seem to be normal operations. The only slightly odd thing is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, but without more context or signs of malicious activity, it's hard to classify this as interesting. The Chrome activities are typical. So, I think this batch is not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events reflect normal system behavior: Chrome loading Defender DLLs, SDXHelper.exe creating legitimate Office resource files, and Chrome handling downloaded files with Zone.Identifier.

So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with long, seemingly random hashes in their names. That's a bit odd. Usually, legitimate Office updates or packages might have some unique identifiers, but creating so many JavaScript files with those hashes could be a red flag. Also, the same file names are repeated, which might indicate that the process is creating duplicates, which isn't typical behavior.\n\nThen there's an entry where chrome.exe loads urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL, so maybe not suspicious on its own. But combined with other events, maybe not. Then winlogbeat.exe creates a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That could be part of a legitimate installation or configuration, but I need to check if there's any other context.\n\nNext, EXCEL.EXE is launched with a specific Excel file, and then it loads combase.dll, which is another standard system DLL. Not suspicious here. But then there's another SDXHelper.exe creating another JavaScript file in a different SolutionPackages directory. The pattern seems similar to the first ones.\n\nNow, considering all these events: the repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe in Office-related directories with unique hashes. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Office usually has its own set of helper executables, but I'm not sure if SDXHelper is one of them. Maybe it's part of some add-in or third-party software. However, creating multiple JS files in the OfflineFiles directory under SolutionPackages might be related to some kind of malicious activity, like injecting scripts or preparing for a payload.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The presence of multiple file creations with similar naming patterns in a non-standard location could be indicative of something malicious. However, without more context, like network activity, process injections, or other anomalies, it's hard to be 100% sure. But given that all these files are created by the same process in a specific directory, and the filenames have those hashes, it's worth flagging as interesting for further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks like part of Microsoft Office, but the file name is a .js file. Sometimes, legitimate Office add-ins might create files there, but sometimes malware does too. Not sure yet, need to check more.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are all legitimate system files, so that's normal. Excel uses .NET and other system components, so loading these DLLs is expected. Not suspicious here.\n\nThere's a Registry value set event from svchost.exe multiple times. svchost is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes could be a red flag. However, without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell. Maybe part of normal operations.\n\nThen, the user account management event, which seems benign. Also, a Pipe Created event from EXCEL.EXE. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which is normal. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe interesting part is the repeated FileCreate events for SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages. The first one was word_88b0...js, then another af-za-ui-strings-json_d4db...js. The names are a bit odd. The first one might be a legitimate resource, but the second one has a language code (af-za) which might be a red herring. However, creating multiple JavaScript files in that directory could be unusual. Also, the same file path is mentioned twice for the same file, which might be a duplication or an error in logging.\n\nAlso, there's a File Delete logged event for a temporary Excel file (~$Cronograma...xlsx). That's a common temporary file created by Excel when editing a document, so that's normal. The deletion is also expected.\n\nBut the main concern is the SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages. SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, but if it's creating unexpected files, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, it's possible that these are legitimate resources being cached. Without more context, like the content of the files or other suspicious behavior, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all events together, the most suspicious part is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a directory that's typically used for Office resources. However, since the files are JavaScript and the process is SDXHelper, which is a known Office component, it's possible that this is legitimate. But the fact that there are multiple such events might indicate something more. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like network connections, unusual registry changes, or other process behaviors. The rest of the events are normal system and application activities.\n\nSo, the classification is interesting, but with moderate confidence.

They all seem to be part of some package resources. Then there's EXCEL.EXE creating a temp file and loading some DLLs.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is a Microsoft Office-related process, right? It's part of the Office solution deployment. Creating those JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder might be normal for language packs or updates. But why so many repeated entries? Maybe it's just a lot of files being copied as part of an installation or update. The EXCEL.EXE events are about creating a temporary Excel file and loading standard DLLs like coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL. Those are legitimate system files.\n\nWait, the HxTsr.exe process is a bit suspicious. I don't recall that being a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's a typo or a renamed malicious file? But without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell. However, the rest of the logs don't show obvious signs of malware. The files being created by SDXHelper.exe are in expected locations for Office packages. The Excel events are normal.\n\nSo, the HxTsr.exe registry change might be the only unusual part.

SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office, so maybe it's downloading language packs or resources. But why so many repeated entries for the same files?

Excel creating shortcuts in the Recent folder is normal, but the repeated registry changes by Excel could indicate something like a macro or add-in modifying settings.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are a lot of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are 28 of those. Then, there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Finally, there are two entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nNow, the key question is whether this is interesting. Let's break it down. The repeated registry changes by Excel might be normal, but if there are a lot of them, it could indicate something. However, the more concerning part is the file creation by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office solution deployment, so creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the filename here is a JavaScript file, which could be a red flag if it's not expected. \n\nBut wait, the user hasn't provided any context about whether this is a known legitimate activity or not. The presence of multiple registry changes by Excel might be normal during certain operations, but combined with the file creation, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate process. However, the large number of registry events might also be a sign of something unusual. \n\nOn the other hand, if all these events are part of a normal Office update, then they might not be interesting.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, there's a bunch of events here. The main thing I notice is that the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names are all .js files, which are JavaScript files. Now, normally, Office might use such files for add-ins or language packs, but the repetition here is a red flag.\n\nWait, the same files are being created multiple times. Like, office_strings_247...js is created twice, then taskpane_e0b...js twice, and so on. That's unusual. Typically, a legitimate application wouldn't create the same file multiple times unless it's updating or replacing it, but even then, it's not common to see multiple entries for the same file in logs. Also, the paths are all under the SolutionPackages folder, which might be related to Office add-ins. However, the presence of multiple different .js files with different names suggests that maybe there's an attempt to inject or deploy multiple components, which could be malicious.\n\nThen there are DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. But Excel doing DNS lookups isn't necessarily bad. However, combined with the file creation events, it might indicate some kind of communication or data exfiltration. But the DNS queries don't have any specific domains mentioned, so it's hard to tell. However, the main issue here is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. \n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, specifically related to the Office Add-in Debugger. But even so, creating so many files in the SolutionPackages directory might be out of the ordinary. However, the fact that the same files are being created multiple times could indicate a problem. Maybe the process is being used to deploy malicious scripts under the guise of legitimate Office components.\n\nAnother point is the naming of the files. They have random-looking hashes in the names, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual content. For example, \"f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2\" and \"36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\" look like GUIDs or hashes. This could be a sign that the files are generated dynamically, possibly by malware to avoid detection. Legitimate files might have more predictable names, but in the context of add-ins, they might use such identifiers. Still, the repetition and number of files created seem suspicious.\n\nAlso, considering the user's environment: the files are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is a common location for user-specific data. However, if the user is not an administrator, it's possible that malware could be using this location to store files without needing elevated privileges. \n\nPutting this all together: repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process but in an unusual context, along with the naming conventions of the files, might indicate a potential security issue. However, without more context, like the content of the files or network activity beyond DNS queries, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the combination of these factors does raise a red flag.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is that all the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. \n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are from SDXHelper.exe, which is part of Microsoft Office, right? The files being created are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, and the filenames are things like fr-fr-ui-strings-json_...js. These look like localization files, maybe for different languages. The fact that they're being created by SDXHelper.exe might be normal if the system is installing or updating Office components. \n\nBut then there's the last event, which is from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. However, the presence of this event might be a red flag if it's unexpected. But since there's only one such event and the rest are from SDXHelper.exe, maybe it's not a big deal.\n\nNow, considering the classification. If all these events are part of legitimate software installation or updates, then they're not interesting. But if the files being created are not part of any known legitimate process, that could be suspicious. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process, so creating these files might be normal. The repetition of the same files being created multiple times (like the same JSON files) could indicate a problem, but maybe it's just a log duplication error. \n\nOn the other hand, the confidence level. Since all the events are from a legitimate process and the files are in expected directories, the confidence might be low that this is malicious. However, the presence of multiple identical events might be a sign of something wrong, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the process is legitimate and the files are in expected locations. The justification would be that the events are part of normal Office operations, and the winlogbeat event is a standard configuration file creation.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in various locations under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the hr-hr-ui-strings-json file appears twice, and the same goes for others. That repetition might be a red flag.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but I should check if it's behaving normally. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The names of the files include language codes (like hr-hr, hu-hu) and UI strings, which might be part of a legitimate Office package. However, the repetition of the same files being created could indicate something odd. Maybe it's a failed attempt to install or update, or perhaps it's a malicious process trying to inject files.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they all point to SolutionPackages, which is part of Office's installation structure. The presence of multiple files with different language codes might be part of a legitimate localization process. However, the fact that the same file is created multiple times could be a sign of an issue. Maybe the process is looping, or there's a misconfiguration. \n\nOn the other hand, if these are all part of a normal installation or update, then it's not suspicious. But the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Since the same files are being created multiple times, that might not be normal. Also, the process is creating a lot of files, which could be a sign of something like a malware dropper, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is that all the events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, maybe it's just doing a lot of file creation as part of its normal operations. However, the repetition might still be concerning. \n\nI should also consider the confidence level. If there's no other suspicious activity, like network connections or other processes involved, then the confidence might be lower. But since all events are about file creation by the same process, and the files are in a legitimate directory, maybe it's not a high priority. However, the repetition of the same files could still be a sign of something wrong. \n\nHmm, I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated file creation events. Even though the process is legitimate, the repetition might indicate an anomaly. The justification would be the repeated creation of the same files by SDXHelper.exe.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. They're all in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. The same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might be normal if it's part of a package installation or update. But why so many similar entries? Maybe it's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses such paths to hide.\n\nThen there are some registry events and DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe. Registry changes could be normal, but combined with the file creations, it might indicate something. However, the majority of the logs are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe. \n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, related to solution packages. So creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal during updates or installations. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe the process is being used to inject malicious code, but the file names don't look suspicious. They seem to be UI strings for different languages, which could be part of a legitimate localization package.\n\nBut wait, the same file is logged multiple times. Could that be a sign of something wrong? Maybe the process is being used to overwrite files repeatedly, but without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the presence of registry changes and DNS queries might be unrelated. The EXCEL.EXE DNS query could be normal if it's accessing external resources, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs might be part of a normal Office update process. However, the high number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory could be worth investigating further. But since the files are in a known location and the process is legitimate, maybe it's not malicious. The confidence here is moderate. I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there are other indicators of compromise, but the logs provided don't show clear signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which aligns with legitimate Office update\/localization processes.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first entry has a null process and winlog task, and no file info. Maybe that's just a placeholder or an error. Then there are two entries where SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit suspicious because it's in a user's AppData folder, which is common for temporary files, but creating a JS file there might be unusual, especially if it's part of a package. However, SDXHelper.exe could be a legitimate process related to Office solutions.\n\nThen there's a long list of events where EXCEL.EXE is setting registry values. Excel setting registry values isn't normal behavior. Typically, Excel doesn't modify the registry unless there's a macro or some add-in involved. But having 23 entries of the same process doing the same action repeatedly is a red flag. That could indicate something like a macro trying to persist changes or a malicious script automating registry modifications. \n\nCombining the two parts: SDXHelper creating a JS file and Excel modifying the registry multiple times. The JS file might be part of a malicious payload, and the registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, like the content of the JS file or the specific registry keys being modified, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the sheer number of registry events from Excel is concerning. \n\nI need to check if the registry changes are benign. If they're related to Excel's normal operations, maybe not. But since the user hasn't provided more details, the combination of unusual file creation and repeated registry modifications by Excel might be enough to flag this as interesting.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first seven entries, they all have the process name EXCEL.EXE and the winlog task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with file being null. Excel normally doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's part of normal operations? However, repeated registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're related to persistence or configuration changes. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, these entries alone might not be suspicious unless there's a pattern or specific registry keys involved.\n\nThen, starting from the eighth entry, there's a shift. The process changes to SDXHelper.exe, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files being created are in paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The filenames include things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json\" and \"transcription-strings.min.js\". These look like language-specific UI string files, possibly part of an Office add-in or localization package. The fact that multiple files are being created in this directory might be normal during an Office update or installation, but I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the setup and installation processes. So, if this process is creating files in the expected directories, it might be part of a legitimate update. However, the repetition of multiple file creations could indicate a larger package being deployed. But the presence of \"PackageResources\" and \"OfflineFiles\" might be part of an Office add-on or a custom solution.\n\nNow, combining both parts: Excel modifying the registry multiple times and SDXHelper creating numerous files. If these events are happening in a short time frame, it might indicate an installation or update. However, the sheer number of registry changes by Excel could be unusual. But considering that Office applications sometimes make registry changes during their operation, especially if there's an add-in or macro involved, it's possible that this is part of normal activity.\n\nHowever, the justification for \"INTERESTING\" would be if there's a combination of events that suggest a potential security threat. For example, if the registry changes were to keys related to security settings or if the files created were malicious. But in this case, the files are named as UI string files, which are typically benign. The process names are legitimate, and the paths are within expected Office directories.\n\nWait, but the confidence level here is important. If there's no clear indication of malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. However, the fact that Excel is making multiple registry changes might be unusual. But without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell. The SDXHelper creating files is normal during an Office update. So, perhaps this is a legitimate activity, and the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n\nBut I should check if there's any pattern that's suspicious. For example, if the same registry value is being set multiple times, or if the files created are in unexpected locations. In this case, the files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is expected. The process names are legitimate. So, unless there's an anomaly in the registry keys or the files' content, this might be normal.\n\nTherefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are consistent with legitimate Office operations, even though there are multiple events. However, if the system is not expecting an Office update, or if this is part of a larger set of events that include other suspicious activities, it could be different.

The files have names like \"mi-nz-ui-strings-json...\" and others with different language codes. These seem to be UI string files, maybe part of a localization package. But why are they being created repeatedly?\n\nWait, there's also one event where EXCEL.EXE is setting a registry value. That's a bit different. But the rest are all file creations by SDXHelper.exe. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, used for managing solutions and add-ins. However, the fact that it's creating so many files, especially in the SolutionPackages folder, might be normal during an Office add-in installation or update.\n\nBut the key point here is the repetition. The same files are being created multiple times. That could indicate a problem. For example, if a process is repeatedly creating the same files, it might be a sign of a loop or a malicious activity trying to inject files. However, considering that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, maybe this is part of a normal operation, like deploying multiple language packs or resources.\n\nAnother thing to note is the file paths. They are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. That's a common location for Office add-ins and solutions. So, maybe the user is installing or updating an Office add-in that requires these files. However, the same files being created multiple times might not be normal. Perhaps there's an error in the installation process, or maybe a malicious process is using SDXHelper.exe to deploy its own files.\n\nBut wait, the logs don't show any other suspicious activities like network connections, process injections, or unexpected command-line arguments.

Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and some random strings. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in solution packages, maybe for add-ins or something. The files being created are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which might be part of a setup or installation process. But why are there three entries for the same file? Wait, no, looking again, the first entry is nb-no-ui-strings-json with a different hash, and the second and third are ne-np-ui-strings-json with the same hash. Wait, the second and third entries are identical. Maybe a duplicate log entry?\n\nBut the main thing is the process creating these files. If SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, then this might be part of a normal Office update or installation. However, the presence of multiple files with language-specific names might be unusual. But considering that Office supports multiple languages, maybe they're just installing language packs. However, the file paths are under SolutionPackages, which might be more related to add-ins rather than language packs. \n\nAlternatively, could this be malicious? The filenames include \"ui-strings-json\" which might be related to user interface strings, but that's normal for localization. However, the hashes are unique, but without knowing the expected hashes, it's hard to say. The fact that the same file is logged twice might be an error in the logging system, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother angle: the user is fiddelis. If this user is a regular user, and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft process, then this might be normal. However, if the user is not supposed to be running Office setup or if the files are being created in an unexpected location, that could be a red flag. But the path seems to be the standard AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory, which is where Office stores solution packages.\n\nSo, considering all that, these events might be part of a legitimate Office operation. However, the repeated creation of the same file might indicate an issue, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. The classification here would depend on whether creating multiple language-specific files under SolutionPackages is normal. Since I don't have information on that, but given that the process is legitimate and the path is standard, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.
