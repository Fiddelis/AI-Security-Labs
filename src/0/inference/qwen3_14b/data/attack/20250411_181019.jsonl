{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. There's an entry for 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes 'sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\"'. Wait, the script path is 'NonExistingScript.ps1', which might be a typo or a fake path. Also, the 'sc create' command is used to create a service, which is unusual unless it's part of legitimate software installation. But creating a service with a script that doesn't exist could be a sign of something malicious trying to hide its activities by creating a service that runs a non-existent script. \n\nAnother entry has 'sc.exe' with a similar command line, creating another service with 'componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Again, the same pattern of non-existent scripts. Also, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to the registry, possibly for persistence. \n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' might be normal, but if there's an unusual image being loaded, that could be a problem. However, 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate Windows DLL, so that might not be an issue here. \n\nThere are also multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, which could be normal, but combined with the service creation attempts, it might be part of a larger attack. The presence of 'whoami.exe' is usually benign, but in context with other suspicious activities, it could be used to gather information.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory might be part of log collection, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting it all together, the creation of services with non-existent scripts, multiple registry changes, and frequent PowerShell and cmd usage could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The confidence is moderate because while some activities are suspicious, they might not be definitively malicious without more evidence. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated attempts to create services with non-existent PowerShell scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), frequent registry modifications, and unusual process access events for PowerShell and cmd.exe. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious payload execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events. First, I'll look for any suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n\nI notice multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed, which is common but can be a red flag if there's a lot of activity. Then there's 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is usually benign but might be part of a larger malicious process. \n\nLooking deeper, there's an event where 'cmd.exe' is involved in creating a file named 'something.exe' in the 'AppData\\Local\\Temp' directory. That's a common tactic for malware to hide files in temporary directories. Also, the 'cmd.exe' process is loading 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe', which seems normal, but the creation of the executable in Temp is suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the 'calc.exe' process loading 'urlmon.dll', which is part of Internet Explorer and generally safe, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, since 'calc.exe' is a legitimate process, this might not be a direct threat.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a new YAML file in the Downloads directory is likely part of a log file or configuration, so that's probably legitimate. However, the repeated 'chrome.exe' events loading 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll' might be related to antivirus components, but if there's an unusual number of such events, it could indicate evasion techniques.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activity is the creation of an executable in the Temp directory by 'cmd.exe' and the potential misuse of 'calc.exe' and 'chrome.exe' loading certain DLLs. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain, but these are indicators that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that could indicate potential security threats. Here's a structured analysis of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious File Creation in Temp Directory**\n- **Event**:  \n  - **Process**: `cmd.exe`  \n  - **Action**: Created a file named `something.exe` in the temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`).  \n  - **Indicators**:  \n    - **Malicious Behavior**: Malware often creates executable files in temporary directories to avoid detection.  \n    - **Lack of Context**: No clear justification for this file creation (e.g., no user-initiated action or legitimate software installation).  \n\n  **Risk Level**: **High**  \n  **Recommendation**: Investigate the origin of `something.exe` (e.g., file hash analysis, process tree, and user context).\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell and Command-Line Activity**\n- **Events**:  \n  - Repeated access to `powershell.exe` (e.g., `Process accessed` events).  \n  - `cmd.exe` loading `powershell.exe` (potentially for executing malicious scripts).  \n\n  **Risk Level**: **Medium**  \n  **Recommendation**: Monitor PowerShell usage for signs of obfuscation or execution of suspicious scripts (e.g., `Invoke-Expression`, `IEX`, or downloading payloads).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual DLL Loading**\n- **Events**:  \n  - **`calc.exe`** loading `urlmon.dll` (part of Windows' Internet Explorer).  \n  - **`chrome.exe`** loading `amsi.dll` (Antimalware Scan Interface) and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component).  \n\n  **Analysis**:  \n  - **`urlmon.dll`**: Typically safe, but its loading by `calc.exe` (a legitimate process) could indicate tampering or injection.  \n  - **`amsi.dll`\/`MpOAV.dll`**: These are security-related DLLs. If loaded by `chrome.exe` (a browser), it might suggest evasion techniques to bypass antivirus\/EDR tools.  \n\n  **Risk Level**: **Medium**  \n  **Recommendation**: Correlate these events with process memory dumps or behavioral analysis to check for code injection or tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Legitimate Activity with Potential Misuse**\n- **Event**:  \n  - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory.  \n  - **Context**: Winlogbeat is a log shipper, and this file could be part of a configuration update.  \n\n  **Risk Level**: **Low**  \n  **Recommendation**: Confirm the file's legitimacy (e.g., check timestamps, user context, and whether it aligns with known Winlogbeat behavior).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Chrome.exe and Registry Events**\n- **Events**:  \n  - **`chrome.exe`** repeatedly triggering `Registry value set` events.  \n  - **Potential**: Could indicate Chrome being used as a vector for malicious activity (e.g., registry modifications for persistence or proxy configurations).  \n\n  **Risk Level**: **Low-Medium**  \n  **Recommendation**: Check for unusual registry changes (e.g., persistence keys, proxy settings, or unauthorized modifications).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n| **Indicator**                          | **Risk** | **Action Required** |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|\n| `cmd.exe` creating `something.exe` in Temp | High     | Investigate file origin and process context |\n| PowerShell access and `cmd.exe` usage   | Medium   | Monitor for script obfuscation or payload execution |\n| `calc.exe`\/`chrome.exe` loading suspicious DLLs | Medium | Analyze process memory for injection or tampering |\n| Winlogbeat file creation in Downloads | Low      | Confirm legitimacy via file analysis |\n| Chrome.exe registry modifications     | Low-Medium | Correlate with other logs for persistence indicators |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **File Analysis**:  \n   - Hash `something.exe` and cross-reference with threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).  \n2. **Process Monitoring**:  \n   - Use EDR tools (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) to inspect `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `chrome.exe` for malicious behavior.  \n3. **Registry Analysis**:  \n   - Audit registry changes linked to `chrome.exe` for persistence or configuration tampering.  \n4. **User Context**:  \n   - Determine if the activities occurred under a privileged account or during off-hours (indicating potential compromise).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The most critical threat is the creation of `something.exe` in the Temp directory by `cmd.exe`. This warrants immediate investigation, as it is a common tactic for malware to execute payloads in memory or on disk."}
