{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, whoami.exe being executed, powershell.exe accessed. These could be normal, but then I see a file created by winlogbeat.exe. That's a log shipping tool, so maybe part of normal operations. But then there's a cmd.exe process that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, but when combined with commands like this, it might be part of data exfiltration or something malicious. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The command lines involve encoding calc.exe (which is a legitimate Windows utility) but the temp files might be used to hide malicious payloads. Also, the use of certutil to decode files into the Temp directory could indicate that someone is trying to execute a decoded file, which might be a malicious executable.\n\nAnother point is the registry value sets. Multiple processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and others are modifying registry values. While some registry changes are normal, excessive or unusual changes can be a red flag. The presence of SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll might be suspicious if those DLLs are not expected, but I need to check if those are legitimate. However, the fact that it's loading those DLLs via SDXHelper.exe could be part of a malicious process.\n\nAlso, the chrome.exe has multiple network connections. If it's connecting to unusual IPs or domains, that's a problem. But the events here just mention \"Network connection detected\" without specifics. However, combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, creation of temporary files, multiple registry changes, and network activity could indicate a potential malicious activity. The presence of processes like whoami.exe and powershell.exe is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it's more concerning. \n\nI should check if the decoded files are actually malicious. The filenames like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" might be obfuscated. Also, the fact that certutil is being used in a way that's not typical for normal operations (like encoding a system file like calc.exe) might be a sign. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch does show several suspicious activities that would warrant further investigation. The confidence is high enough but not certain, so maybe around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event log contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, indicating potential malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Certutil Misuse for Encoding\/Decoding**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process uses `certutil` to encode `calc.exe` (a legitimate Windows utility) into temporary files (e.g., `componente_auxiliar.txt`, files in the Temp directory). This is often a technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads or exfiltrate data.\n   - Multiple `certutil.exe` instances create files in the Temp directory, which could be staging areas for malicious executables.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process creates a file named `componente_auxiliar.txt` in the Downloads directory. While not inherently malicious, this could be part of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events involving `chrome.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` suggest potential tampering with system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Network Activity**:\n   - Multiple `Network connection detected` events by `chrome.exe` (without specific IPs\/domains) could indicate data exfiltration or communication with C2 servers.\n\n5. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` loads `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll` (system DLLs). While not inherently malicious, this could be part of a process injection or exploitation attempt if the context is unexpected.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Analysis**\n- **Legitimate vs. Malicious Behavior**:\n  - `certutil` is a legitimate tool for encoding\/decoding files, but its misuse here (e.g., encoding system utilities into temporary files) is suspicious.\n  - `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` are common in both benign and malicious scenarios. However, combined with other indicators (e.g., network activity, file creation), they raise concerns.\n\n- **Potential Attack Chain**:\n  - **Initial Access**: Possibly via phishing or exploit (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` loading unexpected DLLs).\n  - **Persistence\/Exfiltration**: Use of `certutil` and temporary files to hide malicious payloads or exfiltrate data.\n  - **Command-and-Control**: Unusual network connections from `chrome.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe event log contains **multiple red flags** that suggest **potential malicious activity**, such as data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or exploitation. While further analysis (e.g., checking file contents, network destinations, user context) is required to confirm malicious intent, the combination of indicators **warrants immediate investigation**.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High (0.85\/1.0)**  \n**Recommendation**: Isolate affected systems, analyze the decoded files, inspect network traffic, and check for unauthorized user activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about 'chrome.exe' with the task 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. That's a lot of entries, but maybe that's normal? Chrome might modify the registry as part of its operation, like updating settings or extensions. However, repeating the same event multiple times could be a sign of something automated or maybe even malicious, but I need to check other entries too.\n\nThen there's an entry for 'SDXHelper.exe' with 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)' pointing to 'urlmon.dll'. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by SDXHelper.exe, which isn't a standard process, that might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the filename has a .new extension, which could indicate a temporary file during setup. Not necessarily malicious, but worth checking.\n\nThen there are entries for 'powershell.exe' with 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Multiple process accesses might be benign, like scripts running, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nNow, considering all together: the majority of events are from Chrome and PowerShell, which are common processes. The SDXHelper.exe and winlogbeat.exe entries don't immediately look malicious. However, the repetition of the same event (Chrome registry changes) might be normal if it's part of a legitimate process. But if these events are part of a larger pattern, like repeated registry modifications without a clear reason, that could be suspicious. However, without more data, like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to confirm. The presence of multiple registry changes by PowerShell could be part of a script, which is normal, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nOverall, the batch doesn't show clear signs of a security incident. The events are mostly from legitimate processes, and there's no obvious malicious activity. However, the repetition of the same event might warrant further investigation, but not enough to classify it as definitely interesting. So, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.6, as there are some unusual entries but nothing conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains routine system events, primarily from legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) and standard operations like registry modifications and file creation. No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present across the entire batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
