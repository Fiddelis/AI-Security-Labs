{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple network connections from chrome.exe. Chrome making a few network connections isn't too unusual, especially if it's just browsing. But then there's the powershell.exe activity. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the events shows powershell.exe executing a command line that starts a process with a batch file path. The paths here look a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\pacote_secundario\" might be a way to navigate directories, but maybe that's just part of the file path. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used to start these processes could be a red flag, especially if these scripts are doing something unexpected.\n\nThen, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of them are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. But one of them is \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe that's okay. But the presence of multiple image loads might be normal during process execution.\n\nLooking at the file operations: a temporary file is created and then deleted. That's common in scripts, but the fact that PowerShell is creating and deleting files could be part of a larger operation. Also, there are several entries where PowerShell is starting processes with different batch files. The command lines all start with \"Start-Process\" and point to various .bat files. The paths are structured with \"C:\\\\...\" followed by some directory navigation. \n\nWhat's concerning is the repetition of these events. There are multiple instances of PowerShell executing these Start-Process commands, each with different paths. While some might be legitimate, the pattern could indicate automated or script-based activities. Also, the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" in some events might relate to PowerShell's own processes, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nAnother point is the registry events. PowerShell modifying registry values could be part of configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The ApplicationFrameHost.exe also has a registry event, but that's a common Windows process, so maybe not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: the main red flags are the multiple PowerShell executions of batch files, the network connections from Chrome (though that's less concerning), and the file creation\/deletion. However, without more context on what the batch files are doing, it's a bit hard to determine if this is malicious. But the pattern of repeated PowerShell activities and the use of temporary files might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate script, but the repetition and the number of events could indicate something more. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Execution of Batch Files:** Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `Start-Process` commands to run `.bat` files with paths like `C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat`. The use of `..` in paths may indicate directory traversal, which is not inherently malicious but could mask obfuscation or access to unexpected locations.\n   - **Repetition of Patterns:** The same command structure (`Start-Process \"C:\\...\\modulo_..._script.bat\"`) appears repeatedly, suggesting automated or scripted behavior. This could be legitimate (e.g., batch job scheduling) but may also hint at lateral movement or payload execution.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. While common in PowerShell operations, this could be part of a larger process (e.g., downloading or executing payloads).\n\n3. **Network Activity:**\n   - **Chrome Network Connections:** Multiple network connections from `chrome.exe` are logged. This is typical for browsing but could indicate data exfiltration if correlated with other events (not visible here).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **PowerShell and ApplicationFrameHost.exe:** Both processes modify registry values. While PowerShell's registry changes are common in scripting, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` (a Windows process) modifying the registry is less typical and may warrant scrutiny.\n\n5. **Loaded DLLs:**\n   - **MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender):** Loading this DLL is normal, but the presence of multiple image-load events for PowerShell-related DLLs could indicate process injection or malicious code execution if unexpected.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Scripted Automation:** The repetitive use of `Start-Process` with `.bat` files suggests automation, which could be legitimate (e.g., system maintenance) or malicious (e.g., command-and-control communication).\n- **Obfuscation via Paths:** The use of `..` in file paths may be an attempt to evade detection or access hidden directories.\n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional information (e.g., the contents of the `.bat` files, user context, or correlation with other logs), it's challenging to definitively label this as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `.bat` Files:** Analyze the scripts referenced in `Start-Process` commands to determine their purpose and whether they contain suspicious commands (e.g., downloading payloads, modifying system settings).\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:** Check for unusual PowerShell activity, such as use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or other network-related cmdlets.\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs:** Link these events with network traffic, file system changes, or user activity logs to identify potential malicious behavior.\n4. **Check for Privilege Escalation:** Determine if these processes are running with elevated privileges, which could indicate exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the repetitive PowerShell activity, potential obfuscation in file paths, and the absence of clear context for the scripts executed. While not definitively malicious, these patterns align with behaviors seen in both legitimate automation and adversarial techniques. Further analysis is required to determine intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Calculator.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. That's normal sometimes, but when combined with other events, maybe not. Then there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. Not too bad yet.\n\nWait, here's an Image Load event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably okay. Then chrome.exe has several registry events. A lot of registry changes could be a red flag, but maybe just normal operations. However, looking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, there's a Start-Process command that points to a batch file in a directory that seems a bit odd: \"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" suggests possible path traversal, which might indicate an attempt to access files outside the intended directory. That's suspicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process running a script from \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". Again, the directory names are a bit generic and might be part of a malicious setup. Also, there's a File Created event for a text file in the Downloads folder, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events could be part of data exfiltration.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple registry value set events by chrome.exe. While Chrome might modify the registry for updates or settings, a high number of such events could indicate something malicious. Also, the Image Load events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem.\n\nLooking at the process tree, there's a mix of legitimate processes (chrome, powershell, cmd) but the command lines and paths mentioned don't seem standard. The presence of multiple registry modifications, process accesses, and file creations could indicate an attempt to persist or execute malicious code. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these events could be benign, but the combination of unusual paths and multiple suspicious activities raises the flag. So, I'd say this is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### **1. Suspicious File Paths and Command-Line Arguments**\n- **Path Traversal in `Start-Process`**:  \n  A `powershell.exe` process executes a batch file with a path containing `..` (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario\\..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat`). This suggests **potential path traversal** or an attempt to access files outside the intended directory, which could indicate malicious intent (e.g., evading detection or accessing sensitive files).\n\n- **Unusual Script Locations**:  \n  Scripts like `componente_principal.txt` (created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`) and `entrada_geral_script.bat` (executed from `C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal`) use non-standard, generic directory names. These could be part of a **malicious payload** or **dropped files** from an attack.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Excessive Registry Modifications**\n- **High Volume of `Registry value set` Events**:  \n  Multiple processes (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`) trigger `Registry value set` events. While registry changes are normal, **excessive or unexplained modifications** could indicate **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Creation in Unusual Contexts**\n- **File Created in User Downloads Folder**:  \n  A `powershell.exe` process creates a file (`componente_principal.txt`) in the user's `Downloads` directory. While not inherently malicious, this could be **data exfiltration** or **staging for further attacks** if the file contains sensitive data or is part of a larger payload.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Legitimate Processes in Suspicious Contexts**\n- **`chrome.exe` Loading Defender DLLs**:  \n  Events like `Image loaded` for `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) are legitimate. However, if these are loaded **outside normal execution paths** or in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they could indicate **tampering with security tools**.\n\n- **`svchost.exe` Creating Files in System Directories**:  \n  A `svchost.exe` process creates a file in `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat`. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate host process, file creation in system directories could signal **malware persistence** or **log tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Potential Lateral Movement or Persistence**\n- **Multiple `FileCreate` and `Registry` Events**:  \n  The combination of file creation, registry modification, and process execution (e.g., `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`) suggests **attempts to establish persistence** or **execute commands** on the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs shows **multiple red flags** that could indicate **malicious activity**, such as:\n- **Path traversal** in command-line arguments.\n- **Unusual file creation** in non-standard directories.\n- **Excessive registry modifications**.\n- **Legitimate processes used in suspicious contexts**.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nFurther investigation is required, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of suspicious files (e.g., `componente_principal.txt`).\n- Checking for **process tree anomalies** (e.g., parent-child relationships between `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and the batch files).\n- Monitoring **network traffic** from the involved processes for data exfiltration.\n- Scanning the system for **malware signatures** or **unauthorized software**.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High suspicion** (but not definitive proof of compromise)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first seven entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set operation. The task is 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' and the file is None. Now, chrome.exe is a common browser, but modifying the registry could be suspicious. However, if it's just a few times, maybe it's normal. But seven times? That seems a bit excessive. Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but repeated registry changes might indicate something else, like a persistence mechanism or a malicious payload.\n\nThen there's the eighth entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in its data directory might be normal. The path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during configuration setup. That might be a legitimate activity, especially if the user is setting up or updating Winlogbeat.\n\nThe ninth entry is powershell.exe creating a file called elemento_base.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily malicious. However, depending on the context, if this is part of a larger set of activities, it might be worth looking into. But alone, it's not a red flag.\n\nNow, considering all together: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be a sign of something. However, if all these events are from the same process and no other suspicious activities are present, maybe it's a false positive. But the combination of repeated registry modifications and the creation of a new file by Winlogbeat might indicate that the system is being monitored, but the chrome.exe activity could be benign. However, if the registry changes are in specific keys related to persistence or execution, that's a concern. But the logs don't specify the registry keys or the values changed, so it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the justification should be concise. So, the main points are: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe (which is not typical for a browser) and the creation of files by Winlogbeat and PowerShell. However, without more context on the registry keys or the files' content, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence level might be around 0.6 because there's some suspicious activity but not enough to confirm malicious intent. However, since the same process (chrome.exe) is doing the registry changes multiple times, that's a pattern that could be interesting. The other events are more benign. So, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with the justification that multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe might indicate potential malicious behavior, even though other events are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated registry value modifications (RegistryEvent) may indicate suspicious behavior, though no clear malicious activity is confirmed. Additional context (e.g., specific registry keys) would improve analysis.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
