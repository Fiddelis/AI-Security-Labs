{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in certain ways, like executing scripts or starting processes, that can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. \n\nThe first few entries have command lines like 'powershell.exe & {Start-Process ...}' with paths that have '..\\' in them. The '..\\' is a directory traversal, which might indicate that the script is trying to access a parent directory, possibly to bypass security measures or access files that shouldn't be reachable. For example, 'C:\\\\objeto_padrao\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat' – the '..' here could be a way to navigate up a directory. That's a common tactic in attacks to access files outside the intended path.\n\nThen there are other entries with 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. These might be related to system processes, but combined with the suspicious paths, it's concerning. Also, there's a 'File created' event in the path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Creating files in user-specific directories might not be inherently bad, but if it's done by a process that's not normally there, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nOther processes like Chrome.exe and Calculator.exe are mentioned, but they're mostly related to registry changes. However, multiple registry value sets for Chrome might be normal if the browser is updating itself, but the repetition here could be a sign of something else. But the main red flags are the PowerShell commands with the directory traversal and the creation of a file in the PowerShell startup directory.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the 'Image loaded' event points to 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably not an issue. But the other PowerShell activities still stand out.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts with suspicious paths, using '..' to traverse directories, and creating files in user directories could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or bypass security measures. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome's registry changes), the combination of these PowerShell activities makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious command lines with directory traversal (e.g., '..\\\\') in file paths, which may indicate attempts to access unintended locations or execute hidden scripts. Combined with file creation in user-specific directories, this suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's a lot, but here it's just a few entries. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe involved. The first notable event is a registry value set, which isn't too bad on its own. But then there's a process creation event with a command line that starts a batch file. The path here is \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". Wait, the path has \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That might be a red flag. It could be trying to access a file in a parent directory, maybe to bypass some security measures or to hide the actual path. Not sure yet, but that's something to note.\n\nThen there are several image loaded events for powershell.exe. The files loaded are all standard system DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET Framework, so that's normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET. The one that stands out is \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being loaded in an unusual context? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temporary script might be part of normal operations, but sometimes malware does this to avoid leaving traces. However, since it's in the Temp folder and gets deleted, it's possible it's just a temporary script. Still, the fact that it's created and then deleted could be suspicious, especially if there's no clear reason for it.\n\nLooking at the command lines for the Provider Lifecycle events. Each time, PowerShell is starting a process with a batch file. The paths here again have \"..\\\" in them, similar to the earlier one. For example, \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\unidade_comum\\..\\estrutura_ativo\\estrutura_geral_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. This could be a way to bypass path-based security checks or make it harder to track the source of the script.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell activities involve creating temporary files, loading various DLLs, and using paths with directory traversals. While some of these are normal, the combination of multiple suspicious elements—like the directory traversal in paths, temporary file creation\/deletion, and multiple process creations—might indicate something malicious. However, it's not definitive. The presence of legitimate system files being loaded complicates things. But the repeated use of \"..\\\" in the paths and the temporary script could be signs of an attack. \n\nI need to decide if this is enough to classify as \"INTERESTING\". The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of events does raise flags. So, I think it's worth investigating further, hence \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior, including directory traversal in file paths, temporary script creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET-related DLLs. While some activities are normal, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe triggering Registry value set events. Registry changes can be normal, but when combined with other activities, they might indicate something suspicious. However, on their own, they might not be a red flag.\n\nThen, looking at the chrome.exe entries, there's an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading this DLL, that's normal. But MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. However, sometimes malware might impersonate legitimate DLLs. But without more context, like unexpected paths or unusual behavior, it's hard to say. But these paths look standard.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That's part of Windows Update, so that's probably normal. Then, powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads folder. Creating files in Downloads isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious payloads, it could be suspicious. However, the filenames here are just \"componente_principal.txt\" and \"elemento_base.txt,\" which don't immediately look malicious. But maybe they're just benign files.\n\nThere are a lot of Registry value set events from chrome.exe. If chrome is modifying registry keys, that could be part of normal operations, like updating settings. But if it's doing it excessively or in unusual locations, that's a problem. However, the events don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't tell for sure.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But if it's unexpected, maybe someone is tampering with it.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several registry changes and file creations, but none of the files are in suspicious locations, and the processes involved are typically legitimate. The only potential red flags are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and the file creations via powershell. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities (like network connections to bad IPs, unexpected process executions, or unusual command-line arguments), these events might just be part of normal user activity or legitimate software operations. \n\nBut wait, the fact that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry changes could be a sign. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for various purposes. The ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs might be normal if they're part of real-time protection. The PowerShell-created files might be benign. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the events don't present a clear malicious pattern. They might be normal operations. However, the high number of registry events from chrome.exe could be worth looking into further. But since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, and there's no clear malicious activity, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING,\" but with moderate confidence because some activities could be benign. However, the presence of multiple registry events and file creations might still be a point of interest. Maybe I should check if there's any correlation between the events. For example, if the same user or process is doing multiple things, but the events don't show a clear attack chain. So, perhaps \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.5. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The justification would be that while there are some suspicious activities, they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include standard system activities (e.g., registry modifications by Chrome, file creation by PowerShell in user Downloads directory) and legitimate process interactions (e.g., AMSI DLL loading). No clear malicious patterns or anomalous behavior are observed across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
