{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry multiple times might be normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe chrome is just updating settings or extensions.\n\nWait, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, it could be part of a larger attack. However, here it's just a single ProcessCreate event. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. Oh, that's a red flag. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is commonly used in malware to steal sensitive information. The fact that it's being executed multiple times with different paths suggests it's part of a persistent attack or trying to evade detection by changing locations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. While loading .NET assemblies is normal for PowerShell, the combination with the keystroke logging script might indicate that the attacker is using .NET to execute malicious code, which is a common tactic.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines with different paths (C:\\elemento_secundario..., C:\\registro_ativo..., etc.) suggests that the attacker is trying to execute the same malicious script from various locations, possibly to avoid detection or because the original path was blocked. This is a classic sign of evasion techniques.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and the registry modifications could indicate that the attacker is trying to maintain persistence or alter system settings to keep the malware active.\n\nPutting this all together: the key indicators are the execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 multiple times from different paths, which is a clear sign of keystroke logging, and the loading of .NET DLLs which might be part of the payload delivery. These activities are highly suspicious and indicative of a potential security threat. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here points to malicious activity. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keystroke logging.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user provided a bunch of system log events, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll scan through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. That's common, but the command lines are repeating a similar pattern: using Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to the TEMP directory. The script's name is the same across multiple entries, which is a red flag. Typically, attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities, and keystroke logging is a classic technique for stealing sensitive information.\n\nThen, there are events related to file creation and deletion in temporary directories. The fact that files are created and then immediately deleted might be an attempt to hide malicious activities. Also, the presence of multiple instances of the same script being executed from different paths (like C:\\modulo_padrao, C:\\elemento_base, etc.) suggests that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the source or test different paths to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat entries. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if there are multiple file creations related to it, maybe the logs are being tampered with or there's an attempt to inject data. However, the other entries might not be directly related to that.\n\nI should also check for any unusual registry changes or image loads. There's an entry for conhost.exe and svchost.exe creating files in system directories, which might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell scripts, it could indicate a broader attack.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit high because the repeated use of the same malicious script, the keystroke logging, and the temporary file creation\/deletion are all signs of potential malicious behavior. However, since there's no direct evidence of a successful attack or data exfiltration, I might not be 100% certain. But the combination of these factors makes it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories suggest potential keystroke logging attempts.
