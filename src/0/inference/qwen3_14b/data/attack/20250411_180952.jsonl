{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries for svchost.exe and chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. Those are common processes, so maybe normal behavior. But then there's the cmd.exe and net.exe commands. Wait, looking at the command_line for one of the cmd.exe entries: it's adding a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a serious security issue. Also, the passwords look like they might be temporary, but the fact that they're being added to Domain Admins is concerning.\n\nThen there's the use of net1.exe, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe a typo or a malicious executable? The command lines for net1.exe are similar to net.exe, which is a standard Windows tool, but the presence of net1.exe could be suspicious. Also, the user is using commands to add users and groups in the domain, which could indicate privilege escalation or account creation for unauthorized access.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation events. There's a .winlogbeat.yml.new file and a pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup, but the presence of new configuration files might be worth checking. However, the main issue here seems to be the user account creation and the use of cmd and net commands with administrative privileges.\n\nThe powershell.exe entries are accessing processes and modifying the registry. While PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, the combination with other suspicious activities (like adding domain admins) might indicate malicious activity. Also, the command_line in one of the cmd.exe entries includes adding a user with a password that has \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" which seems like a temporary password, possibly used to gain access and then change it later.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of domain admin accounts, the use of command-line tools to modify system settings, and the potential presence of unauthorized executables (like net1.exe) are all signs of possible malicious activity. Even though some processes are normal (like svchost.exe and chrome.exe), the specific commands and actions taken here are highly suspicious. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net' commands, potential privilege escalation, use of uncommon executables (net1.exe), and modification of system settings through cmd\/powershell. These actions align with lateral movement and unauthorized access patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these four events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Wait, SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage (SRU) system. I remember that this file is used by Windows for tracking system resource usage, like memory and CPU. So svchost.exe creating this file might be normal. But I should check if this is a legitimate process. Svchost is a standard Windows process, so this could be a regular system activity. However, sometimes malware might mimic system processes. But without more context, like if there are multiple such events or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, part of the Elastic Stack. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new. That sounds like a temporary configuration file being created. If the user is setting up or updating Winlogbeat, this is normal. However, if this is unexpected, maybe someone is trying to tamper with the configuration. But again, without knowing the user's actions, it's hard to tell. Could be legitimate.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe set a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but it's also a tool that attackers might use. Setting a registry value could be part of a legitimate script or an attempt to modify system settings. But without knowing the specific registry key or value, it's hard to judge. This alone might not be suspicious, but combined with other events?\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe accessed a process. Process access can be normal, like when a script interacts with another process. But if it's accessing processes that are not typically accessed, that could be suspicious. Again, not enough info here.\n\nLooking at all together: The first event is a system process creating a system file, which is normal. The second is a user-related process creating a config file, which might be normal. The third and fourth events involve PowerShell doing registry and process access. But since these are common activities, unless there's a pattern or additional context, they might not be suspicious. However, the combination of PowerShell activities with other events might raise a flag. But I don't see a clear malicious pattern here. Maybe the user is just running some scripts or configuring tools. However, the presence of multiple events involving PowerShell could be worth investigating further. But the confidence is low because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. So maybe classification is INTERESTING but with low confidence. Or maybe NOT INTERESTING. Hmm. The first event might be normal, the second is user activity, the others are common. So perhaps NOT INTERESTING. But the justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity detected. However, the presence of PowerShell events might be a red flag. But without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the confidence is around 0.4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first event is a false positive. I think the answer is NOT INTERESTING because none of the events clearly indicate malicious behavior. The SRUtmp.log is normal, Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, and PowerShell activities are common. Unless there's more context, these are likely benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard system processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) and common administrative tools (powershell.exe) performing legitimate activities (file creation, registry modification). No clear indicators of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
