{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first one shows chrome.exe loading an image from a Windows Defender DLL. That's a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't interact with Defender's components. Then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be normal, but if they're all from the same process and seem repetitive, that might be suspicious.\n\nAnother event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's probably normal user activity, but the .yml.new file might be part of a configuration setup. Then there's a file creation by powershell.exe for a text file, which could be benign, like logging or temporary data.\n\nHowever, the repeated registry events from chrome.exe might indicate something malicious. Malware often modifies the registry to persist or alter system behavior. The fact that there are so many of these events (multiple entries) could be a red flag. Also, the first event involving a Defender DLL might be a sign of evasion techniques, trying to blend in with legitimate processes.\n\nBut I need to check if these are all part of normal operations. Chrome might occasionally interact with system files, but loading a Defender DLL seems odd. The registry changes could be part of a larger attack, like changing settings to disable security features. The confidence here isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the combination of the unusual image load and repeated registry modifications makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repetitive registry modifications (RegistryEvent) and one instance of chrome.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll), which is unusual behavior for a browser process and may indicate evasion or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each line and note what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, tasklist.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost and cmd, but others like powershell are often used in attacks.\n\nThe winlog events mention things like Registry value set, Process Create, Process accessed, Image loaded, and File created. The registry events might be normal, but if there's a lot of them, that could be suspicious. The ImageLoad events show DLLs being loaded. The paths here include amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll, and wmiutils.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But if an attacker is trying to bypass it, maybe they'd disable or tamper with it. However, in these events, it's just being loaded by tasklist.exe, which is a standard tool. But wait, tasklist.exe is being used here, and it's loading those DLLs. But tasklist is a normal utility, so that might be okay.\n\nThen there's the File created event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which is a common place for users to put things, but if it's part of a legitimate installation, that's fine. However, if the user didn't install it, that might be a red flag. But there's only one event here about that.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. There are multiple instances of Registry value set events, which could be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying critical registry keys, that's bad. However, the events don't specify which registry keys are being modified. The Process accessed events might indicate someone trying to manipulate or access processes, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are loaded by tasklist.exe. If those DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But the paths here are standard system paths, so that's probably normal. However, if an attacker is loading a malicious DLL into a process, that's a concern. But in this case, the paths are legitimate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are a lot of Registry value set events, but they're spread across different processes. Some of them are from chrome.exe, which is a browser. Browsers sometimes modify the registry for updates or settings, but again, without knowing the specific changes, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of powershell.exe and cmd.exe could be normal, but they're also commonly used in attack chains. However, without seeing commands or unusual arguments, it's hard to tell. The command_line in one event is tasklist, which is normal.\n\nI also notice that the same process, like tasklist.exe, is loading multiple DLLs. But again, those are standard DLLs. The only thing that stands out is the File created event for winlogbeat, but that's a single event. \n\nPutting it all together, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system processes and legitimate operations. The registry modifications and image loads don't point to anything obviously malicious. However, there's a lot of activity that could be normal, but maybe not. The confidence here is a bit low because there's not enough specific information to confirm malicious intent. But since there's no clear red flags, maybe it's not interesting. Alternatively, the high number of registry events might be suspicious. But without more data, I think it's safer to classify as not interesting. But I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe the confidence is around 0.4 or 0.5.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show common system processes (e.g., svchost.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe) performing typical operations like registry modifications, process creation, and legitimate DLL loading (e.g., amsi.dll). No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
