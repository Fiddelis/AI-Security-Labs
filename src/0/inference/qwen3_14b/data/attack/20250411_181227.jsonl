{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have the same command line in the process field. The command line uses PowerShell to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe when a user logs on. The task is registered under different names like \"unidade_ativo$object\", \"registro_geral$object\", etc. The user group is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running tasks as administrators can be a sign of privilege escalation or unauthorized access.\n\nNow, the other entries are about PowerShell processes triggering various events like registry value sets, process accesses, and image loads. However, the ones that stand out are the first six entries. They all seem to be creating scheduled tasks with the same structure but different names. The repetition of this action might indicate an attempt to persist on the system, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe fact that the same command is used multiple times with different task names suggests automation or a script that's trying to create multiple scheduled tasks. This could be part of a larger attack to ensure the malicious code runs every time the user logs in. Also, using calc.exe as the executable is unusual because it's a legitimate tool but here it's being used in a way that might be part of a larger payload.\n\nThe confidence here is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative privileges is a clear indicator of potential malicious behavior. Even though some entries are about normal process activities, the repeated creation of tasks with elevated permissions is a strong signal that this batch is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe at user logon, indicating potential persistence mechanism attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first few events show that PowerShell is loading various DLLs from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe, which is a common test for persistence. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are legitimate, but the fact that it's being done with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) and targeting Administrators group might be a red flag. The script is named \"estrutura_auxiliar$object\" which seems odd.\n\nThen there are several entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. That could be normal, but the repetition might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. Since the process is None, that might indicate that the event is related to a service or a remote execution, but without more details, it's unclear. However, the high number of these entries (12 times) could be a sign of something malicious, especially if they're all the same.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation and the file creation\/deletion, are concerning. The repeated remote command executions might also be part of an attack. However, some events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs). The presence of both benign and suspicious activities makes me think that this batch is interesting because there are indicators of potential malicious activity, like file tampering and scheduled task creation, even if some parts are normal. The confidence is moderate because while there are suspicious signs, they might not be conclusive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious behavior: file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events. While some .NET DLL loads are legitimate, the combination of these activities raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the batch of events. There are multiple entries here. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nMost of the events are from chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are eight of those. Then there's one from winlogbeat.exe creating a file, and another from powershell.exe creating a file. \n\nHmm, the chrome.exe events are all the same. Setting registry values. But is that suspicious? Well, Chrome might modify the registry for its own purposes, like settings or updates. But if it's happening multiple times, maybe there's something else. However, without more context like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. But repeated events from the same process might not be a red flag on their own.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it might be normal for it to create configuration files. The path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user-installed software. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary or configuration file. Not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\" in the Downloads folder. The name translates to \"auxiliary object\" in Spanish. The file path is straightforward. But PowerShell is often used for scripting, so creating a text file isn't unusual. Unless there's more activity around it, like executing scripts or downloading files, but in this case, it's just a file creation.\n\nLooking at the combination of events: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, which might be normal, and two file creations by legitimate processes. There's no indication of malware here. The events don't show any signs of unusual activity like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or suspicious file modifications. The file paths are in user directories, which is typical for user activities.\n\nSo, considering all events together, they seem to be part of normal operations. Chrome modifying its own settings, winlogbeat setting up configuration files, and PowerShell creating a text file. No signs of malicious behavior. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with medium confidence because while the repeated registry changes might be a bit unusual, they're not clearly malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal process activity (chrome.exe registry modifications, winlogbeat and powershell file creation in user directories) without indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with process and file as None. That's a bit odd because usually, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process or file involved. But maybe those are just incomplete logs or maybe they're placeholders. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's an entry with a process that's a PowerShell command. The command line shows creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. That seems suspicious. Creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be a way to escalate privileges or run malicious code later. The task name is 'unidade_comum', which might be a red herring, but the action is to run calc.exe, which is a legitimate app, but the context here is concerning.\n\nNext, there's an entry about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. Loading that DLL might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but repeated registry changes could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or inject code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory named 'unidade_comum'. That's the same name as the scheduled task mentioned earlier. This could be a connection between the scheduled task creation and the file being created. Maybe the task is being registered here.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. Also, another PowerShell event creating a text file in the Downloads folder. Maybe that's just a normal user activity, but combined with others, it's suspicious.\n\nChrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. Loading these DLLs might be part of legitimate antivirus operations, but if Chrome is doing this, it could be a sign of tampering or an exploit.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the .new extension suggests it's a temporary file that might not be finalized. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin rights, the creation of a task file, and the registry changes by svchost.exe could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or set up persistence. The involvement of WmiPrvSE and the loading of system DLLs might be part of a larger attack. However, some events are normal, like Chrome loading Defender DLLs. The repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' without process details might be noise, but combined with other events, it's a bit concerning.\n\nConfidence is maybe around 0.7. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a security incident. The presence of scheduled task creation with admin rights and possible registry modifications are red flags. But without more context, like network activity or other malicious files, it's not certain. Still, enough to flag as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including PowerShell creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges, svchost.exe modifying registry values, and creation of a task file in the System32\\\\Tasks directory. These could indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
