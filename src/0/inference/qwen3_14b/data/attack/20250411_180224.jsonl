{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving 'schtasks.exe' creating scheduled tasks. For example, there's a command line that uses 'schtasks \/create' with the '\/ru system' and '\/sc daily' parameters. That means the task is set to run as the system user every day. The command line also includes running PowerShell with '-ep bypass' and a script path. The script names mentioned are 'c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Both filenames have 'NonExistingScript' in them, which might be a red flag because they could be trying to execute a non-existent script, possibly to evade detection or as part of an attack.\n\nAnother thing is that 'powershell.exe' is being used with '-ep bypass', which is often used to bypass execution policies, a common tactic in malware. Also, there are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to the registry, maybe to persist the malicious activity. \n\nLooking at the files created, there's a 'File created' event for 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times', which is the scheduled task created by schtasks. That's normal, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it's suspicious. Also, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a YAML file, which might be related to log collection, but not necessarily malicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nHowever, the majority of the events are about registry changes and process creation, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The key points here are the use of scheduled tasks with system privileges, the PowerShell bypass, and the non-existent script names. These could indicate an attempt to execute a malicious script that's not present, which might be a sign of an attack. \n\nBut wait, the script files don't exist. That could be a false positive if the attacker is trying to trick the system. However, the combination of creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges and using PowerShell bypass is a classic attack vector. Also, the repeated registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all this, the events do show suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. The confidence is high because the combination of scheduled tasks, PowerShell bypass, and non-existent scripts are strong indicators of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: scheduled task creation with system privileges using schtasks.exe, PowerShell execution with -ep bypass (common in attacks), and references to non-existent scripts (possible evasion tactic). Registry modifications and file creation in system directories also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided several JSON entries representing system events. My job is to analyze them as a whole and determine if they warrant further investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each event. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's common for it to create configuration files. The file path seems legitimate, and the process is expected. Not suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating 'entrada_ativo.txt' in the same Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't inherently bad. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might be a red flag, but I need to check more.\n\nThen, another ProcessAccess event for PowerShell. The third event is a ProcessAccess for powershell.exe, but no file is mentioned. Maybe it's accessing another process? Not sure yet. The fourth event is whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so that's normal. But why is it here? Maybe part of a script.\n\nThe fifth event is another ProcessAccess for PowerShell. Now, looking at all the PowerShell events: there's a FileCreate, two ProcessAccess events, and the whoami.exe. Could this be part of a malicious activity? Well, PowerShell is often used by attackers, but creating a file and accessing processes isn't necessarily bad. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, especially if they're accessing processes or files in unusual ways, might be suspicious.\n\nWait, but in this case, the files created are in the Downloads directory, which is a common place for user activities. The presence of winlogbeat.exe is normal. The whoami.exe is a legitimate command. However, the multiple PowerShell events might be part of something. But I don't see any clear signs of malware or unauthorized access. The events don't show any failed attempts, unusual network activity, or access to sensitive files. \n\nHmm, maybe the fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could indicate that the process is being accessed by another process, which might be a sign of something. But without more context, like if the accessed process is something unexpected, it's hard to tell. Also, the justification for classification needs to be concise. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the events are not particularly suspicious. They involve normal processes creating files and accessing processes. Unless there's a pattern I'm missing, like repeated access or files in sensitive locations, but here everything seems in the Downloads folder. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve standard processes (winlogbeat, powershell, whoami) performing typical operations (file creation, process access) in user directories. No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or malicious payloads detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
