{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't unusual. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But I should note that.\n\nNext, there are several entries with Registry value set events. Processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and others are modifying the registry. That's common for legitimate processes, but if there's a pattern, maybe something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a normal tool. The Image loaded events for calc.exe and Calculator.exe pointing to urlmon.dll seem normal since that's a standard Windows DLL. Same with amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are related to Windows Defender. Those are legitimate.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entries, there's a lot of Registry value sets and Image loads. Chrome is a common target for attacks, but the files loaded here are standard. The repetition of chrome.exe events might be normal if the user is actively using Chrome, but maybe too many events could indicate something else. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like unexpected file creations in sensitive directories, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation.\n\nThe only potentially suspicious thing is the winlogbeat file creation. But since it's in the Downloads folder and the process is winlogbeat itself, which is a legitimate tool, it might just be part of its normal operation. There's no indication of malware here. The rest of the events are typical system and application activities.\n\nSo overall, I don't see any clear signs of malicious behavior. The events seem to be part of normal system operations. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal system operations (e.g., file creation by winlogbeat for configuration, standard registry modifications by legitimate processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe, and loading of legitimate system DLLs). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: MpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection detected. That's part of Microsoft's Defender, so maybe normal, but I'll keep an eye on it. Then there are multiple chrome.exe entries with network connections and DNS queries. Chrome doing normal browsing might be okay, but if there's a lot of connections, maybe something's up. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious domains or unusual activity here.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also common for legitimate tasks. The command lines here include things like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and 'findstr \/e .key', which might be searching for files with .key extensions. That could be part of a script looking for sensitive files, which is suspicious. The user is searching for .key files, which might be encryption keys or other important data. \n\nThen there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Process access can indicate someone trying to manipulate or monitor processes. Also, Registry value set events might mean changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms. \n\nLooking at the file creations: winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file, which is part of its configuration. That's normal. But there's also a tarefa_geral.txt created by powershell.exe. Not sure what that's for, but maybe it's just a log file. However, combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThe repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with commands that search the file system and modify the registry could indicate an attempt to gather information or establish persistence. The presence of multiple registry events and process accesses might suggest an attacker trying to maintain control or hide their activities.\n\nBut I need to check if all these are normal. For example, the user might be running a script that's legitimate. However, the combination of searching for .key files, multiple registry changes, and process accesses without clear benign context raises flags. The lack of any obvious malicious indicators like connecting to bad IPs or downloading files makes it a bit ambiguous, but the suspicious commands and frequent process access events make me lean towards interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe process access\/registry modifications, file system scans for '.key' files, and unusual process creation chains. While some events (e.g., Chrome network activity) appear benign, the combination of lateral movement indicators (ProcessAccess) and potential data discovery attempts (.key file searches) warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are three events here. The first one is about powershell.exe being accessed, according to the ProcessAccess rule. The second event is the creation of whoami.exe with a command line that shows it's running from the system32 directory. The third event again mentions powershell.exe being accessed.\n\nHmm, whoami.exe is a legitimate Windows tool that displays the current user's identity. But when combined with other processes, it might be part of a malicious activity. However, in this case, there's no indication of any suspicious parameters or unexpected behavior from whoami.exe. The command line is standard.\n\nNow, the repeated access of powershell.exe could be normal, but it's also a common tool used by attackers. However, the logs don't show any arguments or commands executed by PowerShell, which would be needed to determine if it's being used maliciously. The ProcessAccess rule might be triggered by various legitimate activities as well.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The events are all related to process creation and access, but without additional context like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or file modifications, it's hard to classify this as suspicious. The presence of whoami.exe alone isn't a red flag. The confidence here would be low because the logs don't provide enough information to confirm any malicious intent. So, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" since there's no concrete evidence of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process creation\/access activities with no suspicious indicators. 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows utility, and PowerShell access alone is not inherently malicious without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
