{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each line.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, the next event is another registry value set by PowerShell. Then conhost.exe also setting a registry value. Hmm, conhost is usually a console host process, but maybe it's being used here for something else?\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file (.yml.new) might be normal during setup. But the next event is another file created by PowerShell, this time a text file called estrutura_logico.txt. Not sure what that is, but maybe it's just a log file. Then more registry changes by PowerShell and a process access event.\n\nWait, the key points here: multiple registry modifications by PowerShell and conhost. Also, the creation of a .yml.new file, which could be part of a configuration change. However, the presence of multiple registry events and file creations might indicate some kind of configuration change or setup. But is that malicious? Maybe not necessarily. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple events, along with conhost.exe modifying the registry, might be worth looking into. \n\nBut I need to check if there's any suspicious activity. The file paths don't look like typical malicious paths. The .yml.new file is part of Winlogbeat's data directory, which is normal. The estrutura_logico.txt could be a benign text file. However, the combination of registry changes and file creations by PowerShell might be part of a script that's trying to persist or modify system settings. \n\nBut without more context, like the content of the files or the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to say. However, the fact that there are multiple events involving PowerShell and registry changes might be a red flag. But maybe the user is just setting up their environment. \n\nThe classification needs to be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. The justification should be concise. Since there are multiple registry modifications and file creations by PowerShell, which can be part of legitimate activities but also malicious ones, maybe it's worth investigation. However, the presence of Winlogbeat might be a legitimate tool. \n\nBut the confidence is a float. If I'm not 100% sure but there are enough events that might be suspicious, maybe a confidence around 0.6. So the classification is INTERESTING, justification is \"Multiple PowerShell and conhost.exe activities involving registry modifications and file creation, which may indicate configuration changes or potential persistence mechanisms. Further analysis required to confirm benignity.\"\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and conhost.exe activities involving registry modifications and file creation, which may indicate configuration changes or potential persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, right? Browsers often perform DNS lookups. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with a registry value set. PowerShell is commonly used for scripts, but setting registry values could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, it's something to note.\n\nNext, the command line for powershell.exe is & {Get-Date}, which is a simple command to get the current date. That's a basic PowerShell command, not inherently malicious. But there are multiple instances of this command, which might be normal, but maybe not.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events for various DLLs. Some of these are standard system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Loading that might be normal if Defender is running, but maybe in some contexts, it could be a red flag if unexpected.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily and then clean up. The file name has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting such a file quickly could be suspicious, especially if it's part of an attempt to evade detection.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events are part of PowerShell's internal operations, so they might not be harmful. However, repeated entries might indicate something if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this all together: The majority of events are normal system activities. However, the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file, along with multiple registry and image load events, might indicate that someone is using PowerShell for some automated tasks. But since the commands are simple (like Get-Date), it's possible that this is just a legitimate script testing or a benign automation process. However, the fact that the file is created and deleted quickly might be a sign of an attempt to hide activity. \n\nBut I need to check if there's any clear malicious activity. The events don't show any obvious signs of exploitation, like unusual network connections, unexpected processes, or attempts to download malicious files. The PowerShell commands are straightforward. The loaded DLLs are legitimate system files. The only slightly suspicious part is the temporary file creation and deletion, but that could be part of a normal script execution as well.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch is not interesting for investigation. The events don't show any clear malicious behavior. The justification would be that the activities observed are consistent with normal system operations and legitimate PowerShell usage, even though some events are noteworthy, they don't indicate a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system operations (e.g., PowerShell executing benign commands like Get-Date, loading legitimate system DLLs, and temporary file creation\/deletion). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
