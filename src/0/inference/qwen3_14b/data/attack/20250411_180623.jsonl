{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, probably just browsing. Then there's a bunch of powershell.exe events. Some are registry value sets, process creates, image loads, file creates, and deletes. The command line for some is \"Get-Date\", which is a simple command to get the current date and time. That's harmless on its own.\n\nBut then I notice multiple image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard for PowerShell, so maybe not suspicious. However, there's also a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then that file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script file might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do this to execute malicious scripts temporarily.\n\nAnother file created is \"estrutura_logico.txt\" in the Downloads folder. Not sure what that is, but it's a text file. Also, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal configuration changes. However, the presence of multiple file creates and deletes, along with registry changes, might indicate some activity.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. The repeated use of PowerShell, creating a script file in Temp, then deleting it. Also, the registry value sets and image loads. But all the command lines are benign like Get-Date. Maybe the user is just running some tests or scripts. However, the fact that a script is created and then deleted could be a red flag. But without more context, like the content of the script or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, I think it's on the lower side. The events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The PowerShell commands are simple, and the files created are either temporary or part of normal operations. The classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evident malicious behavior. However, the presence of script file creation and deletion could be a minor concern, but not enough to be interesting without more evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity with PowerShell executing benign commands (e.g., 'Get-Date'), temporary file creation\/deletion, and standard .NET Framework DLL loading. No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a batch of events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. Multiple events show PowerShell executing commands like Get-Date, which is a common cmdlet. However, there are also several Image Load events pointing to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal for PowerShell, but I should check if there's anything unusual.\n\nThen, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file path is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1. Creating and deleting a temporary script might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts. However, the justification here is that it's a test script, so maybe it's benign.\n\nAnother file created is estrutura_logico.txt. Not sure what that is, but it's in the Downloads folder. Could be a legitimate file, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also activity with winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But if the file is being modified or created unexpectedly, that could be a red flag. However, the user might be setting up or updating the configuration.\n\nLooking at the registry events, PowerShell modifying registry values could be part of changing execution policies or other settings. Again, this is common but should be monitored.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of PowerShell's communication, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nConsidering all these, the logs show normal PowerShell operations, some temporary file creation, and configuration changes. However, the repetition of certain events and the presence of multiple file operations might indicate something worth investigating. But without more context, like unusual commands or unexpected network activity, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The presence of legitimate tools like Winlogbeat and the use of Get-Date (a harmless cmdlet) suggests that this might be normal user activity. Still, the combination of multiple registry changes and file operations could be a sign of something more, so it's on the edge. Maybe the answer is that it's not highly suspicious but warrants further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily reflect **normal system and user activities** with **no clear indicators of malicious behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Common Cmdlets**: Repeated use of `Get-Date` (a benign PowerShell cmdlet for retrieving the current date\/time) suggests routine scripting or testing.\n   - **Registry Modifications**: PowerShell modifying registry values (e.g., `RegistryEvent`) could relate to changing execution policies or other legitimate configurations. No specific malicious registry keys are indicated.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This is consistent with PowerShell testing or policy validation (e.g., script execution policy checks).\n   - **Legitimate File Creation**: Files like `estrutura_logico.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` are created in expected locations (e.g., Downloads, Winlogbeat data directory). These appear to be part of user workflows or configuration updates.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is likely part of a **configuration update** for Winlogbeat, a legitimate log-shipping tool. No suspicious behavior is evident here.\n\n4. **Other Events**:\n   - **Pipe Creation**: A `PipeEvent` related to PowerShell is normal for inter-process communication.\n   - **.NET DLL Loads**: Image load events for .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `clr.dll`) are expected during PowerShell execution.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **No Malicious Indicators**: No evidence of command-line arguments associated with malicious payloads, unexpected network activity, or anomalous process behavior.\n- **Legitimate Tools**: Winlogbeat and PowerShell are used appropriately, with no signs of tampering or exploitation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs reflect **routine system operations** and **benign user activity**. While the volume of events might warrant monitoring, there are **no immediate security concerns** requiring investigation. Further context (e.g., network traffic, user intent) would be needed to confirm benignity definitively. \n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not interesting for investigation** (no malicious activity detected)."}
