{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can be used for malicious purposes. \n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events, which might be normal, but when combined with other activities, could indicate something. The Image loaded events mention urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or in an unusual context, that might be a red flag. Also, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so loading that might be normal, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThere's a command line in one of the events: \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1\". That's trying to delete a process, which could be part of a malicious attempt to terminate a process that's monitoring or interfering with the attack. Also, the WMIC.exe process is involved in deleting notepad.exe, which is a common technique in some attacks to remove evidence or prevent analysis.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell multiple times with Process accessed events. PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate events, especially with cmd.exe and WMIC.exe, might indicate someone is trying to manipulate processes on the system.\n\nThe file creation event for .winlogbeat.yml.new might be related to configuration changes, but unless there's something unusual about the file, it might not be significant on its own. However, combined with other events, it could be part of an attack.\n\nAlso, the repeated Registry value set events by svchost.exe and other processes might be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But when combined with process deletions and PowerShell usage, it raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these points: the deletion of processes, use of WMIC and PowerShell, loading of certain DLLs, and multiple registry changes. These activities, while not individually conclusive, when combined, suggest potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of processes via WMIC\/cmd.exe, frequent registry modifications by system processes, and PowerShell process access events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events to see what's going on. A lot of the entries are about 'chrome.exe' and 'powershell.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed'. Then there's some 'cmd.exe' activity, including a command to copy a file named 'sethc_backup.exe' to 'sethc.exe', which is a known trick used in attacks to replace system files. Also, there's a 'schtasks.exe' command deleting a task named 'win32times', which might be part of cleaning up after setting up a scheduled task. The 'whoami.exe' commands are common for checking user context, but combined with other actions, they could be part of a larger attack.\n\nI notice that 'Registry value set' events are frequent, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence. The 'Process accessed' events might be monitoring or exploitation attempts. The 'cmd.exe' command involving 'copy' and 'schtasks' suggests someone is trying to modify system utilities or set up scheduled tasks, which is a red flag. Also, the 'taskschd.dll' being loaded could be part of a legitimate process, but in combination with other suspicious commands, it might be malicious.\n\nHowever, there are also many entries that seem normal, like 'chrome.exe' doing registry changes, which might be part of normal operations. But the presence of multiple suspicious commands, especially the 'copy' and 'schtasks' deletions, along with repeated 'whoami' and 'powershell' activities, could indicate an attack. The confidence here is a bit tricky. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof. So I'd lean towards 'INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.75 because the combination of events suggests potential malicious activity, even though some might be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including attempts to modify system files (e.g., copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe), deleting scheduled tasks, and frequent registry changes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on here.\n\nStarting with the first entry: cmd.exe is involved in a registry value set event. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these might be normal if the process is legitimate. But why would chrome.exe be loading these? Maybe it's a false positive, or maybe something's wrong. But I need to check more.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe performing registry value sets. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common tool for administrators. The command line for one of the cmd.exe entries is \"cmd.exe \/c \" which is a common way to execute commands. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool to get user information, so not suspicious by itself. The powershell.exe entries have various image loads, including .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are normal for PowerShell when running scripts, but again, depends on the context.\n\nWait, there's a File created event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing. However, the path is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. But if this script was created by an unauthorized process, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't show the script being executed, just created. So maybe it's a benign test, but maybe not.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The repeated registry value sets by multiple processes could indicate some kind of configuration changes. However, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say. Also, the multiple Image Load events for PowerShell with .NET DLLs might be normal if the user is running scripts that require those libraries.\n\nBut then, the fact that MpOAV.dll is being loaded by both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Since MpOAV is part of Windows Defender, maybe the system is scanning these processes, which is normal. However, if an attacker is trying to bypass Defender, they might try to disable or tamper with these components. But the logs don't show any signs of that.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of both PowerShell and cmd.exe executing commands. If there's a pattern of these processes being used to execute suspicious commands, that could be a sign. But the logs don't include the actual commands executed, only the process names and events.\n\nThe temporary script file creation might be part of a legitimate process, like a user testing scripts or a system update. However, the name \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" suggests that it's related to PowerShell execution policies. If the system is testing or changing execution policies, that could be a concern, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The events are mostly related to normal system operations and legitimate processes. However, the repeated registry changes and the presence of multiple processes loading security-related DLLs could be worth investigating further, especially if there's a lack of context or if other indicators are present. But based solely on these logs, it might not be a clear case for an investigation. However, the user might want to check for any other related events or look into the specific registry keys and commands executed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of interest, but **no definitive evidence of malicious activity** is present. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Processes and DLLs**:\n   - **`chrome.exe`** loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is **normal**, as these DLLs are used for real-time scanning and threat detection.\n   - **PowerShell** loading .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is **expected** when executing scripts or managed code.\n\n2. **Registry Activity**:\n   - Multiple processes (`cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`) performing **registry value sets**. While this is common for system configuration changes, **no specific registry keys or malicious modifications** are indicated in the logs.\n\n3. **File Creation**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. The name suggests it may be related to **PowerShell execution policy testing** (e.g., during script execution or policy enforcement). This is **not inherently suspicious** but could warrant further investigation if the script content is unknown or if it is executed without user intent.\n\n4. **Process Activity**:\n   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** are used in ways consistent with **legitimate administrative tasks** (e.g., user information checks, script execution). However, **`cmd.exe`** with the `\/c` flag is a common vector for command execution and could be used for malicious purposes if paired with suspicious arguments (not visible here).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Low Confidence)**\n- **Repetition of Events**: The high frequency of registry writes and PowerShell image loads could indicate **automated or scripted activity**, which may be benign (e.g., system updates) or malicious (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n- **Temporary Script File**: While the file name suggests a test, the absence of context (e.g., user interaction, script execution) makes it **ambiguous** whether this is legitimate or part of a broader attack chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **unusual command-line arguments** in `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` executions.\n   - Investigate **registry key modifications** (specific keys and values) for signs of tampering or persistence (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n\n2. **Analyze Script Content**:\n   - If the temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is still present, **inspect its contents** for malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Monitor Execution Policies**:\n   - Verify if **PowerShell execution policies** (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`) have been changed, which could indicate an attempt to bypass security controls.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **unauthorized network activity** or **credential access** (e.g., Kerberos tickets, password spraying) that could accompany the observed processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not confirm a security incident**, but the combination of repeated registry activity, temporary script creation, and PowerShell usage **merits further investigation** to rule out potential threats. Focus on **contextual analysis** (e.g., user behavior, network traffic, script content) to determine legitimacy."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a file deletion in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. That's a red flag because deleting files, especially in temporary directories, might be part of cleaning up after malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be normal operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're benign or malicious.\n\nAnother event mentions the creation of a file by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That seems legitimate, maybe part of normal system operations or monitoring.\n\nThere's also a file creation in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That could be part of setting up profiles, which isn't necessarily bad, but sometimes attackers use such locations to hide scripts.\n\nRegistry value set events and process accesses are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The presence of multiple such events might not be conclusive on their own.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some PowerShell commands check for the existence of specific .bat files. These paths have a pattern with \"..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories. However, the scripts aren't actually being executed here; they're just checking if they exist. That could be part of a larger attack, but on its own, it's not definitive.\n\nThe majority of the events don't show clear malicious intent. The first deletion and the file checks are suspicious, but without more context or additional indicators like unusual network activity or unexpected process behavior, it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious. The confidence is moderate, but not high enough to be certain. So, it's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not a clear-cut case.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell file deletion in the Temp directory followed by multiple PowerShell process events with suspicious command-line patterns checking for specific .bat files across unusual paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's a PowerShell process checking if a certain batch file exists. The command line is using Test-Path, which is a common PowerShell cmdlet. The exit codes are 0 or 1 based on the presence of the file. That seems normal, maybe part of a script that checks for prerequisites.\n\nThen there are several ProcessAccess events for PowerShell. That's not unusual, but maybe if there are multiple accesses, it could be a sign of something. But alone, not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so loading them is normal when running .NET-based scripts or applications. However, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be a red flag. Why would PowerShell be loading Defender's DLLs? That could be a sign of evasion techniques, trying to interact with or bypass Defender.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary PowerShell script file. Creating and deleting a temporary file is common, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious code, it could be suspicious. However, in this case, the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be related to script execution policy testing, which is a legitimate activity.\n\nAnother FileCreate event for a file in the Downloads folder named elemento_padrao.txt. That's a generic file name, maybe just a normal file, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from Chrome. Chrome modifying registry values isn't uncommon, but if it's doing it repeatedly, maybe there's something like a registry-based persistence mechanism. However, the task is just \"Registry value set\" without specific details on which keys are modified. Without more info, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe PipeCreated event for PowerShell is normal, as PowerShell can use named pipes for communication between processes.\n\nThen there are more PowerShell processes with similar Test-Path commands checking different paths. These paths have components like modulo_ativo, componente_padrao, etc., which might be part of a legitimate application's structure, but the repeated checks could be part of a script that's trying to locate files in specific directories, which might be part of a setup or installation process.\n\nThe ImageLoad of MpClient.dll again, which is part of Windows Defender. Maybe the script is interacting with Defender's APIs, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, it could be a false positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the main red flags are the loading of Defender DLLs by PowerShell, which is unusual, and the repeated Test-Path commands checking for specific batch files. However, without seeing the actual content of those batch files or more context on the registry changes, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. It could be a legitimate script that's just interacting with the system in a way that's not immediately obvious. But given the presence of Defender-related DLLs and the multiple Test-Path checks, it's on the edge of suspicious. Therefore, it might be worth investigating further to see if these activities are part of a larger pattern or if they're benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a mix of normal system behavior and potential indicators of suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Checks (`Test-Path`):**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}`. These checks are common in scripts that verify prerequisites or dependencies. However, the repeated use of similar patterns across different paths (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`) may suggest a scripted workflow or potentially a staged process (e.g., checking for the presence of files before executing further actions).\n\n2. **Loading of Windows Defender DLLs:**\n   - PowerShell processes load Defender-related DLLs such as `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll`. While these are legitimate components, their loading by PowerShell could indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass Defender's real-time protection. This is a **potential red flag** and warrants further investigation (e.g., checking for unexpected interactions with Defender APIs).\n\n3. **File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - Temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) are created and deleted, which is normal for PowerShell. However, the creation of a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` might relate to script execution policy testing, a legitimate activity. Still, the presence of such files in non-standard locations (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`) could be part of a larger pattern.\n\n4. **Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events from Chrome are logged. While Chrome can modify registry keys (e.g., for updates or configuration), repeated modifications without clear context might indicate **persistence mechanisms** or tampering. However, without details on the specific registry keys or values, this remains ambiguous.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event for PowerShell is benign but may indicate inter-process communication, which is normal in some scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activity appears to involve **legitimate system behavior** (e.g., script checks, .NET DLL loading). However, the **unusual loading of Defender DLLs by PowerShell** and **repeated registry modifications by Chrome** could indicate **suspicious behavior** or **potential evasion tactics**. These patterns are not definitively malicious but merit closer scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate Defender DLL Usage:**\n   - Check the context of the Defender DLLs being loaded (e.g., via process tree analysis, memory dumps, or network activity) to determine if they are being used for legitimate purposes or to bypass security controls.\n\n2. **Analyze Chrome Registry Changes:**\n   - Examine the specific registry keys and values modified by Chrome to rule out persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering.\n\n3. **Monitor Script Behavior:**\n   - Correlate the `Test-Path` commands with subsequent actions (e.g., file creation, network requests) to determine if they are part of a larger workflow or malicious payload delivery.\n\n4. **Check for Anomalies in PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Use tools like **SIEM** or **EDR** platforms to detect unusual PowerShell activity (e.g., obfuscation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs do not conclusively indicate a security incident, but the **combination of Defender DLL loading and repeated script checks** raises questions that warrant further investigation. This is a **low to medium priority alert** that should be reviewed in the context of broader system telemetry."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the events to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There are several 'Registry value set' events, which might be normal, but I need to check for any suspicious patterns. Then there's a 'Process Create' event with a command line that creates a new item and sets content in a batch file. The command line seems to be using PowerShell to create files and write \"dir\" into them. That might be benign, but sometimes attackers use similar techniques to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the 'Image loaded' events, they're loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. However, since it's a legitimate process, maybe that's okay. But I should check if there's any unusual loading here.\n\nThen, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command lines that create and modify batch files across different directories. The pattern here is consistent: creating a new item with -Force and then setting the content of another file to \"dir\". The paths are all over the place, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual target. However, writing \"dir\" into a batch file isn't inherently malicious, but if this is part of a larger attack, like executing arbitrary commands, it could be a red flag.\n\nThe 'File created' event in the Temp directory is another point. Creating a script file in Temp is common, but if it's part of a download or execution chain, that's suspicious. However, the file name here is __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which sounds like a test script, maybe from PowerShell's own policy checks. That might be legitimate, but I'm not sure.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are the repeated creation of batch files with \"dir\" and the use of PowerShell in various lifecycle events. While some of these could be normal operations, the frequency and the paths used might indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts. However, without more context or evidence of harmful commands, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple FileCreate and ProcessCreate events with PowerShell could be indicative of a script-based attack, but I need to check if \"dir\" is just a placeholder or if there's more to it. If the scripts are just running \"dir\", that's harmless, but if they're executing other commands, that's a problem. Since the logs don't show the actual execution commands beyond writing \"dir\", it's a bit unclear. However, the sheer number of these events and the use of Temp files might still warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events show PowerShell commands creating files (e.g., `New-Item`) and writing content (e.g., `Set-Content`) to batch files across non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`). \n   - The use of `-Force` in `New-Item` suggests an attempt to bypass file existence checks, which is often seen in malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is created in the **Temp directory** with a name resembling a PowerShell policy test. While this could be benign (e.g., a script testing execution policies), the lack of context raises concerns. Temp directories are common targets for malware to stage payloads.\n\n3. **Lateral Movement Patterns**:\n   - The logs show PowerShell creating and modifying files in diverse, non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\modulo_secundario\\..`). This obfuscation may indicate an attempt to evade detection or mask the true target of the script.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**:\n   - While some events (e.g., `.NET` DLLs) are legitimate, the **repetition of file creation** and the use of `Provider Lifecycle` events without clear operational context (e.g., no visible benign command execution like `dir`) suggest potential misuse of PowerShell for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Script-Based Attacks**: The logs could represent the initial stages of a script-based attack (e.g., downloading and executing payloads via PowerShell).\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The use of Temp directories and obfuscated paths might hint at establishing persistence or evading detection.\n- **Lateral Movement**: The spread of file creation across multiple paths could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process execution) to confirm if these scripts are part of a larger attack chain.\n   - Investigate the contents of the created files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) to determine if they contain malicious code.\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Enforce strict PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `Restricted` or `AllSigned`) and monitor script execution in Temp directories.\n\n3. **Investigate User Activity**:\n   - Verify if the user (`fiddelis`) has legitimate reason to perform these actions or if there is a compromised account involved.\n\n4. **Yara Rules\/Signature Checks**:\n   - Use Yara rules or signature-based detection to analyze the created files for known malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile not definitively malicious, the logs exhibit **behavior consistent with adversarial activity** (e.g., obfuscation, Temp directory usage, repetitive scripting). Further investigation is **highly recommended** to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the tasks and files involved.\n\nThe first event mentions a file delete with a temporary script path. Then there's a pipe created, but no file. The third event has a command line that creates a new item and sets content to a batch file. That seems like creating a script. Then there are several image loads, like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's probably legitimate, but maybe not.\n\nWait, the fourth event is an image load of mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but there's a lot of image loads here. Then there are multiple process creates and accesses. The command lines in some events involve checking if certain paths exist. These paths have a pattern with \"modulo_comum\", \"registro_secundario\", etc., which might be obfuscated or part of a larger script.\n\nI notice that several events are creating files in various directories, like C:\\componente_geral\\... and others. The fact that PowerShell is creating multiple files and modifying the registry could be a red flag. Also, the use of \"Set-Content\" to write \"dir\" into a batch file seems odd. Why create a batch file with just \"dir\"? Maybe it's a setup for something else.\n\nThe registry value sets and process accesses might indicate attempts to modify system settings or escalate privileges. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the combination of multiple file creations, registry modifications, and numerous image loads could be indicative of a malicious script running. However, some of these are normal operations, like Defender's MpClient.dll.\n\nBut considering that all these events are from PowerShell and involve creating files, modifying the registry, and loading various DLLs, it's possible that this is part of a larger attack. The repeated use of Test-Path in the command lines might be checking for the presence of other scripts or files as part of a multi-stage attack.\n\nHowever, since there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple file operations and registry changes by PowerShell could be either benign or malicious. But given that the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, the answer would lean towards yes, because the activity is unusual and could be part of a more complex threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits activity that warrants further investigation, though it is not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Heavy Usage:**\n   - **Over 20 PowerShell-related events** are logged, many involving file creation, registry modification, and .NET framework components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in this context (especially with obfuscated paths) raises suspicion.\n\n2. **File Creation and Script Manipulation:**\n   - **File creation operations** (e.g., `New-Item`, `Set-Content`) are observed in directories like `C:\\componente_geral\\...` and `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`. These paths use non-standard, possibly obfuscated naming conventions (e.g., `modulo_comum`, `unidade_padrao`), which could indicate evasion tactics or multi-stage payloads.\n   - A script (`estrutura_principal_script.bat`) is written with the command `dir`, which is trivial but could be a precursor to more complex operations (e.g., executing malicious commands later).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple **registry value set events** are logged. While not inherently malicious, registry changes can be used to persist access, modify system behavior, or escalate privileges. The absence of context (e.g., which keys are modified) limits immediate judgment.\n\n4. **.NET and System Component Loads:**\n   - **Image load events** (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are mostly legitimate (e.g., Windows Defender components). However, the sheer volume of .NET-related activity could indicate a script leveraging advanced PowerShell features (e.g., COM objects, WMI) for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **Path-Checking Patterns:**\n   - Repeated use of `Test-Path` in command lines (e.g., checking for `C:\\modulo_secundario\\...`) suggests **conditional execution logic**. This could be part of a script that adapts behavior based on system state (e.g., checking for existing tools, avoiding detection).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Concern:**\n- **Lack of clear benign purpose**: The scripts created (e.g., `dir` in a `.bat` file) lack obvious utility, which could hint at a staged attack.\n- **Obfuscated paths**: Non-standard directory names may be used to evade detection or obscure the script's true intent.\n- **High volume of PowerShell activity**: While PowerShell is common, such a dense set of operations without clear justification is unusual.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity **merits further investigation** due to:\n- **Unusual PowerShell behavior** (file creation, registry changes, and path-checking logic).\n- **Obscured file paths** that may indicate evasion.\n- **Potential for multi-stage attacks** (e.g., initial foothold, persistence, or lateral movement).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Correlate these logs with other system events (e.g., network traffic, user activity).\n- Analyze the contents of created files (e.g., `estrutura_principal_script.bat`).\n- Check for unauthorized registry changes or unexpected system modifications.\n- Monitor for follow-on activities (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration).\n\nWhile not conclusive proof of compromise, the combination of these factors suggests a **low-to-moderate risk** requiring closer scrutiny."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if a specific file exists, like Test-Path. For example, the first event checks if \"C:\\modulo_geral\\...\" exists and exits with 0 or 1. These commands are common in scripts that might be probing the system for certain files, which could be part of a legitimate process or something malicious.\n\nThen there are events about files being created and deleted, like the temporary script file __PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1. That's a temporary file created and then deleted, which is normal during script execution, especially if the script is being tested or run with some policy checks. However, the fact that there are multiple such files might be a red flag if they're being created in unusual locations or with unusual names.\n\nThere's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal operations if someone is setting it up. But I should note that as a possible legitimate activity.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process accesses, those could be part of normal operations or could indicate something trying to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for the existence of various files. The paths mentioned are all over the system, and some might be legitimate, but the pattern of checking multiple paths could be part of a script that's trying to find specific files, possibly for exploitation. For example, if the script is looking for executable files in different directories, that might be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n\nHowever, I don't see any obvious malicious activities like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or connecting to external IPs. The events are mostly about file existence checks, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading images. These could be part of a legitimate script or a benign process.\n\nBut the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate that the user is trying to check for the presence of certain files, which could be part of a larger attack. However, without more evidence, it's hard to confirm. The confidence level here is moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of **PowerShell-based file existence checks** across multiple system paths, which could indicate **legitimate scripting** or **potential reconnaissance activity**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell `Test-Path` Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of files in paths like `C:\\modulo_geral\\...`, `C:\\pacote_principal\\...`, etc. These checks are often used in **legitimate scripts** (e.g., dependency validation) but can also be part of **malicious reconnaissance** (e.g., probing for sensitive executables or misconfigurations).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1`) is created and deleted. This is **common in benign scenarios** (e.g., script execution with policy checks) but could also be **exploited by malware** to execute payloads in memory.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access Events**:\n   - Events involving registry modifications and process access are **neutral** in isolation but may warrant scrutiny if correlated with other suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized changes).\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - The `winlogbeat.exe` process creating a file in the `Downloads` directory is likely **legitimate** if part of log shipping\/configurations. However, **unusual file paths or permissions** could hint at misuse.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity**: **Low to Moderate**. While the logs do not show direct malicious actions (e.g., payload execution, network exfiltration), the repetitive file checks and temporary file usage could be **early-stage reconnaissance**.\n- **Need for Further Investigation**: \n  - Correlate these events with **network traffic logs** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections).\n  - Check for **unusual PowerShell usage patterns** (e.g., obfuscation, elevation of privileges).\n  - Validate the **legitimacy of the file paths** and the purpose of the scripts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs are **not overtly malicious** but exhibit **behavior consistent with both benign and adversarial activity**. A **moderate risk** is warranted, and further analysis (e.g., process tree reconstruction, endpoint telemetry) is recommended to rule out **potential threat actor activity**. \n\n**Confidence Level**: **Moderate** (requires additional context for definitive classification)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There are several 'Process Create' and 'Process accessed' events. The command lines in the PowerShell processes are checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. For example, the first event checks if \"C:\\registro_ativo\\...\" exists. These might be benign checks, but maybe they're part of something more.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal for PowerShell since it uses the .NET framework. But there's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That could be normal too, but sometimes malware might inject into these processes.\n\nLooking at the files created and deleted, there's a temporary file created and then deleted. That's common in scripts, but maybe a red flag if it's part of a larger pattern. Also, the 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing similar checks might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly for payload execution. The use of 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe' is also common, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nHowever, all the events seem to be legitimate system activities. The checks for file existence could be part of a normal script, and loading .NET DLLs is standard for PowerShell. The temporary file creation and deletion is typical in scripts. There's no direct evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity.\n\nBut wait, the fact that there are multiple PowerShell processes running with these checks might be a sign of something. However, without more context or additional suspicious events (like network connections to unknown IPs, unusual registry changes, or unexpected process executions), it's hard to classify this as malicious. The events could be part of a legitimate script that's checking for dependencies or files.\n\nSo, considering all this, the batch might not be interesting enough for investigation. The events are mostly normal system behaviors. Unless there's a specific pattern or known malicious activity associated with these commands, which isn't evident here, it's probably not a security threat. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of system events primarily involves **PowerShell and cmd.exe processes** performing routine checks for file existence, loading standard .NET DLLs, and temporary file operations. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior**:\n   - Multiple `PowerShell` processes execute commands like `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). These are **common in legitimate scripts** for conditional logic or dependency checks.\n   - Temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) are created and deleted, which is **normal for transient script operations**.\n\n2. **Standard System Components**:\n   - **.NET DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded as part of PowerShell's normal operation.\n   - **Windows Defender modules** (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are loaded, which is **expected during antivirus scans or real-time protection**.\n\n3. **No Clear Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No evidence of **suspicious network activity**, **unauthorized registry modifications**, or **unusual process injection**.\n   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are **benign utilities** used for basic system information or scripting.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events described are **consistent with legitimate system behavior** and do not contain overt signs of malicious activity. While the repetitive use of PowerShell for file checks might raise curiosity, it is not sufficient to warrant investigation without additional context (e.g., unusual timing, correlation with other alerts, or known bad indicators).\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided data."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but when combined with other events, it might indicate something. There are also some cmd.exe and whoami.exe processes. The whoami.exe is usually benign, just checking user identity, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks. There are entries for Process accessed, Registry value set, and Image loaded. The Image loaded events mention loading .dll files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components, which are normal, but loading them in PowerShell might be part of a malicious script trying to execute code through .NET.\n\nThen, looking at the command lines for PowerShell. They all seem to be checking if certain files exist. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\pacote_padrao\\\\estrutura_base\\\\src\\\\unidade_secundario.cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". These paths have a pattern: they're checking for .cs files in specific directories. The presence of multiple such checks might indicate that the attacker is trying to determine if certain files exist on the system, possibly to check for the presence of a payload or to map the file system.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple entries with the same command lines but different paths. This repetition could be part of a script that's checking various locations. Also, the use of PowerShell for these checks is notable because PowerShell is often used in attacks for its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any actual malicious activity. The events don't show any direct file access or network activity. They're all process creation and access events. But the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, checking for specific files, and loading .NET assemblies might be a red flag. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application, but the repetitive nature and the specific paths could be suspicious.\n\nI should also consider the confidence. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the pattern is unusual and could be indicative of reconnaissance or setup for an attack, the confidence might be moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes are launched with command lines that check for the existence of `.cs` files (e.g., `Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\...\"`). These paths follow a structured naming convention (e.g., `modulo_secundario`, `estrutura_base`, `objeto_padrao`), suggesting a potential attempt to map or probe the file system for specific resources.\n\n2. **.NET Assembly Load Events:**\n   - Several `Image loaded` events involve .NET framework components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). While these are legitimate system components, their loading in conjunction with PowerShell scripts could indicate an attempt to leverage .NET for execution or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Repetitive Command Patterns:**\n   - The repeated use of `Test-Path` in PowerShell scripts across multiple paths may indicate **reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for the presence of specific files or directories). This could be part of an attack chain to identify targets or validate system configuration.\n\n4. **Lack of Direct Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., file downloads, network exfiltration, or unusual process interactions) is present. The events are largely passive (file existence checks) and could theoretically be part of a legitimate application.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Suspicious Behavior:** The combination of PowerShell scripting, .NET assembly loading, and repetitive file existence checks raises **moderate concern**. Such patterns are often seen in **reconnaissance phases** of attacks or in **custom malware** that relies on file-based triggers.\n- **False Positives Possible:** The activity could also be part of a **legitimate application** (e.g., a tool that dynamically checks file paths for configuration files). However, the lack of context (e.g., no associated application logs or user intent) makes this uncertain.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, registry changes, or user activity) that might contextualize these events.\n- **Monitor for Follow-On Actions:** Watch for subsequent malicious activity (e.g., execution of payloads, lateral movement, or data exfiltration) that could confirm this as part of an attack.\n- **Investigate File Paths:** Verify if the `.cs` files referenced in the `Test-Path` commands are legitimate or if they correspond to unexpected or hidden directories.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **potentially suspicious** but not definitively malicious. **Further investigation** is required to determine if this represents benign activity, a false positive, or part of a larger attack. **Confidence Level: Moderate (60-70%)**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. Then there are a bunch of PowerShell processes checking if certain paths exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various locations. Also, there are mentions of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded, which might be normal, but I should check if that's suspicious.\n\nWait, the first event is about loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe if there's an unusual version or if it's not supposed to be there. However, the paths look like standard Defender paths. So maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp folder, then immediately deleted. That could be part of normal script execution, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to store malicious scripts. However, the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which sounds like a test script. But then there are multiple instances of PowerShell checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The name \"Get-Keystrokes\" is a red flag. That script might be used to capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. \n\nAlso, there are multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that check if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\tarefa_geral, C:\\registro_secundario, etc. These paths don't look standard. They might be obfuscated or part of a malicious script's structure. The repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different locations suggests that the attacker is trying to locate a keystroke loggerscript, which is a bad sign.\n\nThe events also include registry value set and process access events. While those alone aren't necessarily malicious, combined with the other activities, they could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or access other processes, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, some of these might be false positives. For example, the Test-Path commands could be part of legitimate scripts that are checking for the existence of files before executing. But the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in non-standard directories are suspicious. Also, the fact that the same script name is being checked in multiple different paths might indicate an attempt to find and execute a malicious script.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the user might be running some automated tests or scripts that generate these logs. But the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even if it's a test, it's worth investigating further to make sure it's not part of an actual attack.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events are normal, the combination of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 checks, multiple Temp file operations, and the non-standard paths suggest that this could be worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the indicators are present that warrant attention.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **mixed indicators** that warrant **further investigation** due to **suspicious patterns** and **potential security risks**, though not definitive proof of an attack. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in non-standard, obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`).\n   - **Why this is concerning:** The name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **common red flag** for **malware** (e.g., keyloggers). The repeated checks across non-standard paths suggest an **attempt to locate and execute a malicious script**.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and deleted in the Temp directory. While common in legitimate scripts, the filename (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) could be **obfuscated** or part of a **malicious payload**.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` with obfuscated paths. This could indicate **script obfuscation** or **attempting to evade detection**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access Events:**\n   - Events like `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` are logged. While not inherently malicious, they may indicate **system modification** or **inter-process communication**, which could be part of a **malicious chain**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Elements:**\n- **Legitimate:**\n  - Loading Windows Defender DLLs (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) is normal.\n  - Temporary file creation\/deletion is common in scripts.\n  - `Test-Path` is a standard PowerShell command.\n\n- **Suspicious:**\n  - The **repetition** of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` checks in **non-standard paths**.\n  - The **lack of clear purpose** for the `PSScriptPolicyTest` file.\n  - **Obfuscation** in file paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario`, `C:\\estrutura_comum`).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Manually verify if any of the referenced paths (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_geral\\...`) contain the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` file.\n   - Analyze the file’s contents (if found) for malicious behavior (e.g., keystroke logging, exfiltration).\n\n2. **Investigate the Temp File:**\n   - Examine the `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1` file for obfuscation or malicious code.\n   - Check for associated processes or network activity during its execution.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **SIEM** to track the source of these commands (e.g., user accounts, remote sessions).\n   - Look for **unusual script execution patterns** (e.g., frequent `Test-Path` calls).\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement:**\n   - Investigate if the `Registry value set` or `Process accessed` events are part of **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **not conclusive**, the combination of **suspicious filenames**, **non-standard paths**, and **repetitive PowerShell activity** raises **red flags**. This batch of events **merits further investigation** to rule out **malicious activity** such as **keylogging** or **script-based attacks**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several ImageLoad events pointing to .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there's an ImageLoad event for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit suspicious because Windows Defender's files are usually in specific directories, and maybe loading that DLL could be part of a malicious activity, but I need to check more.\n\nLooking further, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately after, a FileDelete event for the same file. That's odd. Creating and deleting a script file quickly might be an attempt to execute it without leaving traces. But the script isn't present anymore, so maybe it was a test or a failed attempt.\n\nThe command lines for PowerShell include Test-Path checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is concerning because that script is known to capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. However, in the logs, the Test-Path commands are just checking if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. So maybe the attacker is trying to see if the script is present, but not actually executing it yet. Or perhaps this is part of a larger plan where the script is intended to be run later.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which could indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The Registry value set events for PowerShell and other processes might be normal, but if they're modifying critical registry keys, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't be sure.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably just part of the log collection process, so that's likely benign. The other events like calc.exe and notepad.exe loading urlmon.dll are normal, as those are standard system components.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the Test-Path commands for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the temporary script file being created and deleted. These could be early signs of a malicious actor probing the system. However, without more evidence like actual execution of the script or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. It might be a false positive, but the combination of these events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **ImageLoad Events:** Multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) are loaded by `PowerShell.exe` and `Calculator.exe`. These are legitimate system components, so this is normal.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. This pattern (create\/delete) is often seen in attempts to execute scripts without leaving persistent traces.\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** PowerShell processes execute `Test-Path` checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in multiple directories. While not inherently malicious, `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a known script used for keystroke logging (a common malicious activity). The presence of this script name in logs raises suspicion, even if it's not explicitly executed here.\n\n2. **Windows Defender DLL Load:**\n   - `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) is loaded by `PowerShell.exe`. While this could be benign (e.g., Defender scanning), the context of PowerShell loading security-related DLLs is unusual and warrants further scrutiny.\n\n3. **Registry Activity:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `PowerShell.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are logged. Without details on the specific registry keys modified, this is inconclusive but could indicate tampering.\n\n4. **Benign Activity:**\n   - `whoami.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `notepad.exe` are standard utilities with no obvious malicious intent.\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml` file is likely part of log collection (benign).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not show direct evidence of malware execution (e.g., no `Invoke-Command` or `Start-Process` calls). However, the combination of:\n  - Temporary script creation\/deletion.\n  - `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` being probed.\n  - PowerShell interacting with Windows Defender DLLs.\n  Suggests **potential reconnaissance** or **preparation for a malicious action**.\n\n- **False Positive Possibility:** The behavior could be part of a legitimate script or a red team exercise, but the use of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a red flag.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Reference:**\n   - Check if the script exists on the system or in network shares.\n   - Monitor for subsequent execution attempts.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripting:**\n   - Review PowerShell logs for complex commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`).\n   - Check for `Start-Process` calls to external binaries.\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes:**\n   - Determine which registry keys were modified and their purpose.\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Look for network traffic to\/from suspicious IPs or domains.\n   - Check for unauthorized software installations or service creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **no direct evidence of compromise**, but the combination of script probing, temporary file activity, and PowerShell interacting with security-related DLLs is **suspicious enough to warrant further investigation**. This could indicate early-stage reconnaissance or a failed attack attempt."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating a configuration file is part of its setup. But maybe the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there are several entries about powershell.exe being accessed and process access events. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The fact that it's accessed multiple times might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events could indicate something.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard tool to check the current user. That's usually benign. But if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries show network connections and DNS queries. Browsers typically have a lot of network activity, so this might be normal. However, multiple DNS queries could be a sign of probing or exfiltration, but again, without more info, hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the later entries, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell. The DLLs loaded are all standard Windows components like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. These are legitimate files, so loading them isn't suspicious. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's loading many modules, which could be part of a script or a legitimate process.\n\nNow, considering all events together: The main suspicious thing is the first event where winlogbeat creates a file in the Downloads directory. But since winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, that might not be a problem. The rest of the events are either normal system processes or common tools. There's no indication of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or unexpected command-line arguments. The PowerShell commands listed are basic (like ls -recurse), which are common in scripts but not inherently malicious.\n\nHowever, the repeated access to PowerShell and the loading of multiple DLLs might be part of a larger attack, but without more context or anomalous behavior (like unexpected network destinations, unusual command-line parameters, or access to sensitive files), it's hard to classify this as interesting. The justification might be that there's no clear malicious activity, but the presence of certain events could be worth further investigation. However, given the information, it's leaning towards not interesting unless there's a specific threat model to consider.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal system activities (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, standard PowerShell operations, and legitimate DLL loading).

That might be suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up. But maybe it's just a normal process? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the same command line: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse...}\". This command is recursively listing files and directories. That's a common legitimate activity, but if done repeatedly or in a specific context, it might be part of information gathering by an attacker. However, the same command appearing multiple times could indicate automated scripts or tools, which might not be malicious on their own.\n\nAnother entry mentions the loading of \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe just part of normal operations. The presence of Winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory is probably related to logging or monitoring tools, which are normal if they're part of the system's setup.\n\nThere's also a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. If that's being modified without user knowledge, it could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any combination of events that suggests malicious intent. The initial file creation and deletion might be a red herring if it's just a test. The repeated use of the 'ls -recurse' command could be part of a legitimate script, but if paired with other suspicious activities, it might be more concerning. But looking at the entire batch, there's no clear indication of a successful attack or unauthorized access. The events seem to be a mix of normal operations and potential benign activities. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. While some events are suspicious individually, together they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The confidence is probably around 0.6, leaning towards interesting but not certain. However, considering that there's no strong evidence of compromise, maybe it's better to classify as not interesting. Wait, but the initial file creation and deletion, plus the repeated commands, might be worth investigating. I think the justification would be the combination of file creation\/deletion and repeated commands, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the answer is INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows PowerShell creating and deleting a temporary script file, followed by repeated recursive directory listing commands, which may indicate reconnaissance or script execution attempts. While some events are benign (e.g., Winlogbeat file creation), the combination raises suspicion of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
