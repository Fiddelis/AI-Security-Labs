However, the command line in one of the cmd.exe entries is copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's a red flag because sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys utility, and replacing it with a backup file could be part of a malicious payload. Also, there's a schtasks command deleting a task named win32times, which might be an attempt to remove evidence.

Alright, first I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe have registry value set events. That's common for normal operations, maybe some application settings. But then there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but loading it from System32 seems normal. However, I notice Calculator.exe also loaded urlmon.dll. That's odd because Calculator.exe is a standard app, but maybe that's just part of its normal functioning. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the filename has .yml.new, which could be part of an update or setup. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process running a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's a red flag. Deleting processes, especially using WMIC, can be part of malicious activity like process injection or covering tracks. Then there's WMIC.exe itself being created and loading amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, but if an attacker is trying to bypass it, they might disable or tamper with it. However, loading amsi.dll from System32 is normal. But the command line for WMIC shows deleting notepad.exe processes, which might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAlso, powershell.exe is involved in multiple ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The combination of WMIC and PowerShell trying to delete processes could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. The presence of multiple registry changes might be part of configuring the system for persistence or hiding activities.\n\nSo putting this together: The suspicious actions are the use of WMIC and cmd.exe to delete processes, which is unusual. Also, the loading of certain DLLs and frequent PowerShell activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these actions might indicate an attempt to compromise the system.

Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, but MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. However, the path for MpOAV.dll is in ProgramData, which might be normal. But why is chrome.exe loading these? Maybe it's just normal operation. However, the frequent use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess could be suspicious. But looking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe with \"\/c\" which might be running a command. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here.

Then there are several powershell.exe processes. The tasks include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Loaded. The Image Loaded events mention loading .dll files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal for PowerShell to load them, especially if it's running scripts or .NET applications.\n\nThen there's a File Created event for a temporary script file, and then it's deleted. That's a bit common, maybe part of a script execution. But the command line for PowerShell is \"& {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a red flag. Why would someone run PowerShell with an empty command? Maybe it's a way to bypass detection or part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events, which might relate to PowerShell's internal operations. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file, that's normal if the user is setting it up. But if it's unexpected, maybe not.\n\nHowever, the main thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell with empty commands and the loading of .NET DLLs. Combined with the file creation and deletion, it might indicate someone trying to execute scripts in a way that's not immediately obvious. But I need to check if there are any signs of malicious activity. The fact that the script is created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to hide evidence. The empty command might be a way to avoid triggering alerts that look for specific commands.\n\nBut wait, are there any other suspicious activities? The registry value set events might be normal if the process is configuring something. The pipe created event could be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is involved with an image loaded event, specifically the MpClient.dll file from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a File created event in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for malicious activities, like storing configuration files or scripts. \n\nThen there are several Registry value set events, which could be benign or malicious. The Process accessed events might indicate someone trying to manipulate processes. However, the most suspicious part is the multiple PowerShell commands that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd. They have these double dots and long directory names that don't seem standard. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the \"..\" suggests moving up directories, which might be a way to obfuscate the actual path. \n\nAlso, the command lines are all similar, using Test-Path to check if a .bat file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1. This could be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, maybe to check for the presence of other malware or to see if a payload is already installed. The repetition of these commands across different paths might indicate a systematic check, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the number of these events. There are multiple instances of PowerShell executing these checks. Even though some might be legitimate, the combination of these checks, the non-standard paths, and the use of registry and process access events could point to a malicious activity. The fact that the PowerShell process is accessing the registry and other processes might be part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nHowever, not all events are clearly malicious. For example, the image loaded event for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are part of .NET Framework, which is normal. The initial image loaded for MpClient.dll is also a legitimate Defender file. But the combination of these with the other events raises a red flag.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for specific .bat files in obfuscated paths, along with registry and process access events, suggests that this might be part of a malicious activity.

So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell process creating a new item and setting content to a batch file. The command line shows New-Item and Set-Content commands. That seems suspicious because creating files and writing to them could be part of an attack, like establishing persistence or executing malicious code.\n\nThen there are several other events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. The command lines here are similar: creating new items and setting content in various paths. The pattern is consistent—using PowerShell to create batch files and write \"dir\" into them. That's a red flag because \"dir\" is a basic command, but doing this multiple times across different directories might be an attempt to leave backdoors or scripts that can be executed later.\n\nAlso, the events include Image Load entries for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate system files, loading them in the context of PowerShell might indicate that the process is using .NET to perform more complex operations, which could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe repetition of the same command structure across multiple events suggests automation or a script that's being used to modify the system. The fact that these are happening in different directories might be an attempt to evade detection by spreading out the malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any benign explanation. Maybe these are part of a legitimate software installation or configuration. But the use of PowerShell for file creation and the specific use of \"dir\" in batch files doesn't ring a bell for normal operations. Usually, such operations are done through more standard methods, not repeatedly via PowerShell scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes creating and modifying files in various locations, along with loading .NET components, points towards potential malicious activity.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.

There are several instances where PowerShell is loading DLLs from Windows directories like clr.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then it's deleted. That might be part of a normal script execution, but maybe not. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a lot of events. Maybe that's normal, but if there are too many, it could be suspicious. However, Chrome does interact with the registry, so maybe that's just part of its operation. \n\nLooking at the command lines for some PowerShell processes, there's a test-path command checking for certain bat files. The paths have some odd structures like ..\\pacote_temporario, which might be a red flag. But if those files don't exist, the script exits with 1, which could be part of a legitimate check. However, the presence of multiple such checks might indicate some kind of script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, which could be part of a malicious activity like checking for a payload or a configuration file.\n\nAnother thing is that there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used for persistence. But if it's just a normal profile setup, it's not necessarily malicious. \n\nThe repetition of the same events, like multiple registry changes from Chrome, might be normal, but if they're all the same key or value, it's not suspicious.

The paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, some with names like \"modulo_secundario\" or \"registro_secundario\". These paths don't look standard, which might be a red flag. But just checking for files isn't necessarily malicious. Maybe the user is just verifying the presence of scripts.\n\nThen there are entries about file operations. One is a file created in the Temp directory, then deleted. Another is a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData. Also, there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, so that might be normal. The image loaded events mention Windows Defender DLLs, which are legitimate. \n\nThe PowerShell processes are involved in various tasks: image loaded, file created, file deleted, pipe created, registry value set, and process accessed. Some of these are normal operations, but the repeated Test-Path commands might be part of a larger script that's trying to check for the presence of certain files, possibly as part of an installation or a malicious payload.\n\nLooking at the paths again, they all have a structure where the batch files are in directories that are a couple of levels deep. The use of \"..\" in the paths might be a way to navigate up directories, but that's common in scripts. However, the fact that multiple such checks are happening could indicate that someone is trying to ensure that certain scripts are present, which might be part of a setup or a malicious activity like persistence.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a sign of temporary files used during an operation, which is common, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be more concerning. \n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events are mostly related to normal PowerShell operations and file management. The Test-Path commands are just checking for files, which isn't inherently bad. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded is normal. The winlogbeat file creation is part of a legitimate tool. \n\nThe only potential red flags are the multiple Test-Path commands with non-standard paths and the temporary file creation. But without more context, like actual malicious payload execution, suspicious network activity, or unauthorized access, it's hard to say these are malicious.

The first event mentions the loading of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's just normal operation. Then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might be part of something malicious. Then there are several instances of PowerShell checking if certain executables exist, like componente_secundario.exe and entrada_auxiliar.exe. These paths look a bit odd with a lot of nested directories, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the real location. \n\nThe command lines for PowerShell are testing if specific files exist. If they don't, the script exits with an error code. This could be part of a larger script that's checking for prerequisites before executing malicious code. Also, there are multiple registry value set events and process access events, which might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to interact with other processes.\n\nThere are also instances of whoami.exe and cmd.exe being executed. Whoami is usually benign, just showing user information, but if it's part of a sequence of commands, it might be used to gather information for further attacks. The cmd.exe command checks if a certain file exists in the temp directory, similar to the PowerShell checks. \n\nNow, putting this all together: the repeated PowerShell activity, the creation and deletion of temporary files, checking for specific executables that don't seem to exist, and the use of pipes and registry changes could be signs of a malicious script trying to run and then clean up. However, some of these might be legitimate, like Windows Defender's own processes.

There's also some image loading events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal for PowerShell to load them. But then there are several entries with command lines that check if specific files exist, like various .cs files in different directories. The commands are using Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists.\n\nHmm, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The repeated access and creation of PowerShell processes might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. The image loads are normal, but the command lines are checking for specific files. The paths mentioned don't seem to be standard system paths. They have directories like \"registro_principal\", \"modulo_secundario\", \"estrutura_comum\", etc., which might be custom or part of an application, but the presence of multiple such checks could indicate something like checking for the existence of certain files as part of a setup or deployment process.\n\nWait, but why so many Test-Path commands? If this is part of a legitimate script, maybe they're checking for dependencies. However, if these files don't exist, the script exits with 1, which might be part of an error handling. But the fact that there are so many of these commands could be a sign of something automated, possibly trying to check for certain conditions. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the events include both ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess. ProcessCreate is when a new process is started, and ProcessAccess might be related to accessing the process, maybe through some monitoring tool. However, if these are part of a legitimate application's normal operations, they might not be a problem. But if they're part of a script that's trying to evade detection or perform actions without user knowledge, that's a concern.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the specific command lines might be part of a malicious activity, such as checking for the presence of certain files before executing further steps. However, without seeing the actual content of those .cs files or more context on what's happening after these checks, it's a bit hard to confirm. But the fact that there are so many Test-Path commands in different locations might be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlso, the image loading events are all related to .NET components, which is expected for PowerShell.

These could be part of a legitimate process, but they might also be indicative of a more complex or possibly malicious script. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough data, but the pattern is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are being created and accessed with command lines checking for the existence of specific .cs files in non-standard paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a PowerShell process loading images from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That seems normal because those are legitimate Defender files. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... followed by a deletion of the same file. That could be part of a script testing or temporary file usage, which isn't necessarily malicious, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there are several events where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The commands are using Test-Path and exiting based on whether the file exists. The filenames like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are a red flag because \"keystrokes\" might imply keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. However, the scripts aren't actually being executed here; they're just checking for existence. But the presence of such filenames in multiple paths could indicate an attempt to locate or access these scripts, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a normal command to check user identity, so that's probably benign. The other events involve process access and registry changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 files. Even though the scripts aren't being run here, the naming and the multiple paths suggest that the attacker might be looking for these files, possibly to deploy a keylogger. However, since the actual execution isn't shown, it's not definitive. The confidence is moderate, so maybe around 0.6. It's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not a clear-cut malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of files named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' across various paths, which could indicate an attempt to locate or access potentially malicious scripts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a favorite tool for attackers. Let me check the command lines. There are several instances where the command line checks if a specific file exists, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The paths mentioned are in different directories, but the filename is consistent. Wait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a red flag. That's typically used for keylogging, which is malicious.\n\nThen, there are events related to image loaded, which include various DLLs from .NET and Windows Defender. Those are normal system files, so maybe not suspicious. But the repeated checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate or execute this script. The fact that the script is named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests it's intended to capture keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious intent.\n\nAlso, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack chain. The Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe presence of multiple checks for the same script in different directories could indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the script exists in multiple locations, perhaps to evade detection or to have a backup. The use of Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 is a way to check for the script's presence, which might be part of a larger script that executes it if found.\n\nThe other events, like the ones related to Windows Defender's DLLs, are probably normal. But the repeated PowerShell activity and the specific script name are concerning. The classification here should be Interesting because the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the associated checks suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the script's name is indicative of keystroke logging, which is a clear malicious action.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes check for existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, indicating potential keystroke logging attempts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from 'powershell.exe', which is common but can sometimes be a red flag if used for malicious purposes. There are also instances of 'whoami.exe', 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe', 'svchost.exe', and 'chrome.exe'. The 'whoami.exe' is a standard tool for checking user context, so that might be benign. The 'calc.exe' and 'notepad.exe' are also typical, but the 'Image loaded' events pointing to 'urlmon.dll' might be normal since that's part of Windows. However, I should check if there's anything unusual there.\n\nThe first event mentions a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That path seems legitimate, but sometimes attackers use similar paths to hide malicious scripts. However, just creating a file there isn't necessarily bad. \n\nThere are multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could indicate changes to the registry. If done by legitimate processes like 'svchost.exe', it might be normal. But if there's a pattern of registry changes that's unusual, that could be a sign. However, in this case, the events are spread across different processes, and without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably part of a log management tool, which is normal. The 'Network connection detected' events for 'chrome.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are expected for browser activity and system services. The 'Dns query' event for 'chrome.exe' is also normal for browsing.\n\nNow, looking for any suspicious patterns. The repeated 'Process accessed' events for 'powershell.exe' might be more concerning. However, PowerShell is a common administrative tool, so unless there's evidence of malicious commands, it's hard to tell. The 'command_line' for 'whoami.exe' shows it's being run directly, which is normal. \n\nThe 'file' events don't show any obviously malicious files. The 'urlmon.dll' is a legitimate system file. The only potential red flag is the number of 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, but without more context like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's not conclusive. \n\nConsidering all this, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system processes and legitimate user activities. Therefore, the classification is likely 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence because while there are some typical indicators, they don't point to a clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity with no clear indicators of compromise. PowerShell usage, registry access, and process creation are consistent with typical user behavior.

First, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's chrome.exe, which is normal. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool but sometimes used in attacks. The main focus here seems to be on powershell.exe. There are multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted, and Pipe Created.\n\nThe command line for one of the powershell.exe instances is \"ls -recurse\", which is a common PowerShell command to list files recursively. However, the repeated use of ProcessAccess and Registry events might indicate something. Also, the ImageLoad events show loading of .NET DLLs, which could be normal, but when combined with other activities, might be suspicious.\n\nThe FileCreate and FileDelete events involve a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script and then cleaning up. The Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of normal operations, like a script running and cleaning up.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that include ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These commands are essentially listing files recursively. While that's a normal operation, the repetition might be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's any malicious intent here. Just listing files isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it could be part of something else.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file named MpClient.dll from Windows Defender is loaded. That seems legitimate, but maybe if it's being accessed in an unusual way, but here it's just an image loaded. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's a File created event for .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. But if it's being modified in an unexpected way, that could be an issue. However, the event just says it's created, not modified.\n\nAnother File created event points to a text file named estrutura_secundario.txt. That's a regular file, maybe just a download or user-generated file. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThere are several Registry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate operations, like configuration changes, but it can also be used by malware to persist or modify system settings. However, without more context on what the registry keys are, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Process accessed event for PowerShell might indicate that another process is interacting with it, which could be normal or could be a sign of something malicious. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands that list files, some file creations, and registry changes. While some of these could be part of normal user activities or legitimate software (like Winlogbeat), the combination might be worth looking into. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious scripts, or accessing sensitive files. The events don't show any clear signs of compromise, but the repeated PowerShell commands and registry changes might be indicative of something that needs further investigation. I'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because the activities aren't overtly malicious but could be part of a larger pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing recursive file listing commands (ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse) combined with file creation events and registry modifications.
