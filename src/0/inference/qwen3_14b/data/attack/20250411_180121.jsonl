{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not sure yet, but registry changes can be benign or malicious. \n\nWait, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that downloads a file from GitHub. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common place for code, but sometimes attackers use similar domains. However, the files being downloaded are LICENSE.txt from various repositories. LICENSE files are usually just text files with licensing info, so maybe not malicious. But the fact that PowerShell is being used to download these files might be worth looking into. \n\nThen there are multiple image loaded events for PowerShell, loading .NET DLLs. Those are standard for PowerShell, so that's normal. There's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but the file is a .ps1 script. However, since it's created and then immediately deleted, maybe it's part of a temporary process. But the command lines show that PowerShell is being used to download files, which could be part of a larger script or attack chain.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, they all use WebClient.DownloadFile to get LICENSE.txt from different GitHub repos. The user might be testing something or downloading legitimate files, but the repetition of similar commands might indicate automation or a script that's being run multiple times. Also, the fact that multiple different GitHub repos are being accessed could be a red flag if they're not expected. \n\nAnother thing is that the same PowerShell process is loading several .NET assemblies, which is normal, but combined with the network activity, it could be part of a more complex operation. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events might be normal for temporary files, but the fact that the same pattern is repeated could be suspicious.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The URLs are from GitHub, which is a legitimate source, but the use of PowerShell to download files could be part of a malicious script. However, the files being downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. Unless the user is expecting these downloads, but the logs don't provide context on that. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, there's a lot of PowerShell activity which can be a sign of malicious behavior. On the other hand, all the actions seem to involve legitimate processes and files. The repetition of similar commands might be a sign of a script being run multiple times, but without more data, it's hard to confirm. \n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'd say it's somewhat interesting but not highly suspicious. The presence of multiple network downloads via PowerShell could be a red flag, but without more context, it's not definitive. So, maybe a moderate level of interest, but not a clear attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Network Activity:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes use `System.Net.WebClient.DownloadFile` to download `LICENSE.txt` files from **GitHub repositories** (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). \n   - While GitHub is a legitimate source, the **repetition of similar commands** across different repositories (e.g., `modulo_temporario`, `estrutura_temporario`, `pacote_base`) raises questions about **automation** or **scripting** for purposes beyond typical user behavior.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A `.ps1` script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is **common in malicious scripts** to avoid leaving traces, though it can also occur in benign scenarios.\n\n3. **Registry and DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell processes load standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib`, `System`). While normal, this **combined with network activity** could indicate a **scripted or automated task**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Legitimate Use Case:** The activity could represent a **developer testing scripts** or **automating data retrieval** from GitHub. However, the **lack of context** (e.g., user intent, repository ownership) makes it hard to confirm.\n- **Potential Malicious Use Case:** The repetitive nature of the downloads, coupled with the use of PowerShell for file manipulation, could hint at **script-based attacks** (e.g., exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or initial compromise).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **unusual user behavior** (e.g., elevated privileges, unexpected logins) or **network anomalies** (e.g., traffic to unknown IPs).\n   - Investigate the **ownership and content** of the GitHub repositories being accessed.\n\n2. **Analyze the PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - If the deleted `.ps1` file can be recovered, analyze its contents for malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscation, lateral movement commands).\n\n3. **Monitor for Persistence:**\n   - Check for **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **file modifications** that could indicate **persistence mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **not definitively malicious**, but the **repetitive PowerShell activity** and **temporary file behavior** warrant **closer scrutiny**. A **moderate risk level** is appropriate, with further investigation required to determine intent. \n\n**Confidence Level:** 6\/10 (Suspicious but not conclusive)."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe executing commands that download files from GitHub. The command lines use WebClient's DownloadFile method to get LICENSE.txt files from various repositories. While downloading files isn't inherently malicious, doing so from GitHub might be normal, but the pattern here is repetitive. However, the filenames are all LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. But wait, the paths where they're saved are in the TEMP directory, which could be a red flag. Temporary directories are often used by malware to store files temporarily.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with Registry value set events. A lot of registry changes could indicate some kind of configuration or possibly malicious activity, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repetition might not be significant on its own.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But the same file is created multiple times, which might be redundant or part of setup, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThere's also a Network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That's probably just normal antivirus activity.\n\nThe key suspicious elements are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub. Even though they're downloading LICENSE files, the fact that they're doing it multiple times and using the same method might indicate automated scripts or potential exploitation. However, since the files are from GitHub and are named as LICENSE.txt, which are common, it might be a false positive. But in a real-world scenario, an analyst would check the actual content of those downloaded files to see if they contain any malicious code.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious activity but not conclusive evidence of a security incident. The confidence is moderate because while there are multiple downloads, they're from a known source and the files are named normally. However, the repetition and use of PowerShell for downloading might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **moderately suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, but no definitive evidence of a security incident. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Downloads from GitHub**  \n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes execute commands to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `https:\/\/github.com\/...\/raw\/...\/LICENSE.txt`).  \n   - **Why this matters**: While downloading files from GitHub is not inherently malicious, this pattern could indicate:  \n     - **Automated scripts** (e.g., for legitimate purposes like configuration).  \n     - **Malicious activity** if the files are being used to exfiltrate data or execute payloads.  \n   - **Red flag**: Files are saved to temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...`), which is common for malware to store transient files.\n\n2. **Frequent Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple processes (`chrome.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`) trigger `Registry value set` events.  \n   - **Why this matters**: Excessive registry changes could indicate:  \n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., malware modifying startup keys).  \n     - **Legitimate software updates** (e.g., Chrome updating its settings).  \n   - **Context needed**: Without specific registry keys or values, this is ambiguous.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat File Creation**  \n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates `.yml.new` files in the `Downloads` directory.  \n   - **Why this matters**: Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, but repeated file creation could indicate:  \n     - **Misconfiguration** (e.g., redundant writes).  \n     - **Potential tampering** if the files are being modified by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Concerning Activity**\n- **Windows Defender Network Activity**: `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` has a network connection, which is normal for antivirus updates.  \n- **Conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe**: These are standard Windows processes; their registry modifications are likely benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Risk Level**: **Low to Moderate**.  \n- **Recommendation**:  \n  - **Investigate the downloaded `LICENSE.txt` files** (e.g., check their hashes, content, and origin).  \n  - **Monitor registry changes** for unusual keys (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).  \n  - **Verify winlogbeat configuration** to ensure it’s not being exploited.  \n- **Confidence**: **Moderate** (the activity is suspicious but not conclusive without further analysis).  \n\nNo immediate action is required, but this warrants closer scrutiny."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe not too suspicious on its own. Then there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a normal system process, but frequent registry changes could be a red flag. However, alone, that might not be enough.\n\nWait, there's a Calculator.exe entry. That's unusual because Calculator is typically a user application, not something that would be involved in system processes. But the file path is the same as the first entry, which is a system file. Maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps a typo in the log.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task might be normal, but the name \"spawn\" sounds suspicious. Then there's a schtasks.exe process, which is used to manage scheduled tasks. The command line here is deleting the same \"spawn\" task. That could be part of a cleanup after creating a malicious task.\n\nThen, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. The Run key is where programs start automatically. Deleting a registry value here might be an attempt to remove a persistence mechanism. But why would someone delete it? Maybe they were trying to hide their presence, or perhaps it's part of a legitimate process.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. If there are a lot of accesses, that might indicate something is happening, but without seeing the actual commands, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the use of reg.exe to delete registry keys. That's a system tool, but again, without context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. The fact that there are multiple deletions in the Run key and scheduled tasks might suggest someone is trying to remove traces of their activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and the presence of cmd.exe and reg.exe might indicate an attempt to remove malicious persistence mechanisms. However, some of these actions could be part of a legitimate system cleanup. But the repeated deletions and the specific names like \"spawn\" could be indicative of a security incident. The logs don't show the creation of tasks or registry entries, only deletions, which might suggest that the malicious activity has already occurred, and this is the cleanup phase. Therefore, this batch of logs is suspicious and worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**:\n1. **Deletion of Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` command**:  \n     `REG DELETE \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" \/V \"modulo_temporario\" \/f`  \n     `REG DELETE \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" \/V \"pacote_auxiliar\" \/f`  \n     - These commands **delete registry keys** in the `Run` subkey, which is commonly used for **persistence** (e.g., autorun malware). Deleting these could indicate an **attempt to remove malicious persistence** or **cover tracks** after exploitation.\n\n   - **`cmd.exe` command**:  \n     `REG DELETE \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" \/V \"modulo_temporario\" \/f`  \n     - The presence of a task named **\"modulo_temporario\"** (Portuguese for \"temporary module\") is unusual and may hint at **malicious software**.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**:\n   - **`cmd.exe` command**:  \n     `cmd.exe \/c REG DELETE \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" \/V \"modulo_temporario\" \/f`  \n     - Deleting a task named **\"spawn\"** (a common name for malicious payloads) suggests **cleanup after exploitation** or **removal of a backdoor**.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple entries involving **`reg.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** modifying or deleting registry keys in `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` indicate **active tampering** with system startup configurations. This is a **red flag** for persistence mechanisms or **malware evasion**.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - **`Calculator.exe`** (a legitimate user application) is logged in the same context as system processes like **`svchost.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`**, which is **unusual** and could indicate **process hijacking** or **malware伪装** (masquerading as legitimate processes).\n\n5. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple **`powershell.exe`** entries with **\"Process accessed\"** events may indicate **script execution** or **data exfiltration**, though more context is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Scenarios**:\n- **Malware Cleanup**: The deletion of registry keys and tasks may indicate **post-exploitation cleanup** after a successful attack (e.g., removing persistence).\n- **Persistence Removal**: The activity could be part of a **legitimate security response** (e.g., removing a compromised system's malicious configuration).\n- **Malicious Actor Covering Tracks**: The deletions may be an attempt to **erase evidence** of exploitation or persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **creation** of the deleted registry keys\/tasks (e.g., `modulo_temporario`, `pacote_auxiliar`, `spawn`) to confirm if they were malicious.\n   - Investigate **pre-deletion activity** (e.g., process creation, network traffic, file modifications).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Examine the **arguments** of `powershell.exe` to determine if scripts were executed (e.g., for data exfiltration, lateral movement, or privilege escalation).\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **unusual network activity** or **credential access** (e.g., `whoami.exe` being used to gather user context).\n\n4. **Endpoint Forensics**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Event Log Analysis**, **memory dumps**, or **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** platforms to investigate the **pre- and post-deletion state** of the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe logs suggest **active tampering with system persistence mechanisms** and **cleanup of potential malicious configurations**. While this could be part of a **legitimate security action**, the **unusual process behavior** and **deletion of suspicious registry keys** strongly indicate **malicious activity** that requires further investigation."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, Provider Lifecycle, and ImageLoad. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal because PowerShell often uses these components. However, I notice a few things that might be red flags.\n\nFirst, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of malicious activity, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. But sometimes, this is just part of normal operations, like temporary script execution.\n\nAnother point is the multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's own processes, but if they're occurring in a high frequency or combined with other events, they could indicate something unusual. However, the logs here don't show any obvious command-line arguments that are malicious, just the generic \"& {}\" which might be a placeholder or part of a script that's not fully shown.\n\nThere's also a mention of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That's part of the antivirus software, so that's normal. However, if there were any unusual activities related to those files, that might be a concern, but the logs don't indicate that.\n\nLooking at the other processes, like winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory, that seems like a legitimate activity related to configuration files. The conhost.exe entry with a registry change might be normal as well, since conhost is part of the Windows console host.\n\nOverall, the most suspicious part is the temporary file created and deleted. However, without more context or additional events indicating malicious behavior (like network connections, unexpected registry changes, or execution of suspicious scripts), it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple PowerShell events could be normal, especially if the user is running scripts or using PowerShell for administrative tasks. But the combination of file creation and deletion might warrant further investigation. I'd say this is somewhat interesting but not highly suspicious. Maybe a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events with suspicious patterns: temporary file creation\/deletion (possibly script execution cleanup), repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events, and loading of .NET framework DLLs which could indicate obfuscation or malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. The tasks include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. \n\nThe first thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The command lines here are a bit odd. For example, there's a command line that's \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like a no-op, but maybe that's part of some obfuscation technique. Also, there's a whoami.exe command, which is normal, but when combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger process.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events. PowerShell is loading several DLLs, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code into these processes. However, I don't see any suspicious DLL paths here. The paths are all standard Windows system directories.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to leave no traces. The file is named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which could be a legitimate script, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be suspicious. However, the name suggests it might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which could be legitimate if someone is troubleshooting.\n\nThe registry events are mostly \"Registry value set\" which could be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern of changing critical registry keys, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't be sure.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell processes, the creation and deletion of a temporary file, and the loading of .NET DLLs might be part of a legitimate script execution. However, the frequency and the specific command lines could indicate something more. For example, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might be related to some PowerShell module or provider being used, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe is executed, which is a standard command to get user information. But if this is part of a larger sequence of commands that are probing the system, that could be part of an attack.\n\nConsidering all this, the presence of a temporary file created and deleted, along with multiple PowerShell activities, might be suspicious. However, the lack of clear malicious indicators (like unexpected network activity, unusual file paths, or known malicious hashes) makes it harder to confirm. It's possible that this is a legitimate script being run, but the pattern is something that security tools might flag for further investigation.\n\nSo, I think this batch is somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. It warrants further analysis, maybe checking the context of the PowerShell commands, the user account running them, and any associated network traffic. But based solely on the logs provided, it's on the edge of being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and patterns that could indicate potential security concerns. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use:** PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is invoked repeatedly, which is common for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious operations (e.g., script execution, payload delivery).\n   - **Command-Line Anomalies:** \n     - The command `powershell.exe & {}` is a no-op (no operation), which may be obfuscation or a placeholder for further commands.\n     - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This is a **common tactic for malware** to avoid leaving traces on disk.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A script file is created in the Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1`) and then deleted. While this could be part of legitimate PowerShell execution policy testing, the **ephemeral nature** of the file raises suspicion.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads standard .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). While these are legitimate, **unusual timing or context** (e.g., unexpected processes loading these DLLs) could indicate injection or tampering.\n\n4. **Registry Activity:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events are logged. While this is normal for system configuration, **unauthorized changes to critical registry keys** (not specified here) could be a red flag.\n\n5. **Process Behavior:**\n   - **`ApplicationFrameHost.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** are involved in registry modifications. These processes are typically legitimate but could be **exploited** if compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Suspicious File Lifecycle:** The temporary script file's creation and deletion may indicate **data exfiltration, command execution, or persistence mechanisms**.\n- **PowerShell Misuse:** The use of PowerShell for scripting combined with ephemeral files could point to **malicious payloads** being executed in memory (e.g., PowerShell-based malware).\n- **Lack of Context:** No clear correlation with known benign processes or user actions (e.g., no mention of user-initiated tasks or application usage).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs) during the same timeframe.\n   - Investigate **user context** (e.g., was this initiated by a privileged account?).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - If the deleted script was captured in memory or logs, analyze its content for obfuscation, lateral movement, or credential theft.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Use antivirus\/EDR tools to scan for **malware associated with PowerShell** or the temporary file's hash (if available).\n\n4. **Monitor Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit the specific registry keys modified to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs is **potentially interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell activity, ephemeral file creation, and registry modifications. While these actions could be legitimate (e.g., a user testing PowerShell scripts), the **lack of clear context** and the presence of suspicious patterns warrant further analysis. **No definitive malicious activity is confirmed**, but the behavior is **consistent with advanced persistent threats (APTs)** or **malware evasion techniques**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first entry: Calculator.exe with a registry value set. That's normal, right? Calculator is a legitimate process. But then there's powershell.exe doing a bunch of things. Let me check the other entries. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe with tasks like Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed. Hmm, PowerShell is often used for scripting, but when there are multiple registry changes and process accesses, that could be suspicious.\n\nWait, there's also a line where powershell.exe is removing a file named \"objeto_principal.zip\" from the TEMP directory. The command line shows \"Remove-Item\" which is a PowerShell cmdlet. Removing a file might be part of a cleanup, but if it's part of an attack, that could be a red flag. Also, the file path is in the TEMP directory, which is common for malware to use for temporary files.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: there are several .dll files being loaded, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET Framework. Loading these DLLs is normal when running .NET applications, but if it's unexpected or in a context that's not typical, it might be a sign of something malicious. However, the presence of these DLLs alone isn't necessarily bad.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of \"whoami.exe\" which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But if that's combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nNow, considering the frequency of events. There are multiple registry value sets and process accesses by PowerShell. While PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, a high volume of such events, especially if they're not part of a known legitimate process, could indicate a script-based attack or lateral movement.\n\nAlso, the fact that Chrome.exe is involved in several registry value sets. Chrome is a browser, so changing registry values might be part of its normal operation, but if it's doing a lot of them, maybe there's something else going on. However, Chrome is a common target for exploits, so that might not be a direct indicator.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has a mix of normal activities and some that could be suspicious. The PowerShell activities, especially the file removal and multiple registry changes, along with the loading of .NET DLLs, might be part of a malicious process. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected execution paths, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of multiple events that are typically associated with malicious behavior (like frequent registry changes, process access, and file removal) raises the flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these could be legitimate, but the combination makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Registry Modifications:** Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` performing `Registry value set` operations. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, excessive or unexplained registry changes can indicate script-based attacks or attempts to modify system behavior.\n   - **File Removal:** A `Remove-Item` command in the TEMP directory (`objeto_principal.zip`) suggests cleanup activity. While benign in some contexts, this could also mask malicious payloads or exfiltration attempts.\n   - **Image Loads:** Loading of .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal for .NET applications but could be exploited in attacks (e.g., through malicious scripts or payloads).\n\n2. **Legitimate Processes with Unusual Context:**\n   - **Chrome.exe and Calculator.exe:** These are typically benign, but repeated registry modifications by Chrome may indicate exploitation (e.g., browser-based attacks) or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Malicious Signatures:**\n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., unknown binaries, network connections, or anomalous user behavior) is present in the logs.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **moderately suspicious** due to the **high frequency of PowerShell activities** (registry changes, file operations) and **unusual .NET DLL loading**, which could indicate **script-based attacks** or **post-exploitation behavior**. However, **without additional context** (e.g., network traffic, user context, or file hashes), it is **not definitive proof of compromise**. \n\n**Recommendation:**  \nFurther investigation is warranted, such as:\n- Correlating these events with network logs or endpoint telemetry.\n- Checking for unauthorized user activity or unexpected execution paths.\n- Analyzing the removed file (`objeto_principal.zip`) if accessible.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Highly Suspicious (70-80%)**, but not conclusive."}

That's a common pattern for malicious scripts—creating a temporary file to execute something and then deleting it to leave no trace. The next entry is a pipe created, which might be used for inter-process communication, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'Remove-Item' commands in the command_line fields. These are deleting various .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory. That's a lot of deletions, which could be part of cleaning up after an attack. The repetition of these commands might indicate automated cleanup, which is suspicious.\n\nThen, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the same MpOAV.dll is also loaded by powershell.exe, which is a bit odd. However, that file is in the Windows Defender directory, so maybe it's legitimate. But I should check if there are any other anomalies.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple process accesses and registry changes. However, most of these are from powershell.exe, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The combination of file creation and immediate deletion, along with multiple remove-item commands, suggests that someone might be trying to execute scripts and then erase evidence.\n\nThe presence of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to PowerShell's own operations, but the sheer number of deletions in the TEMP folder could be indicative of a cleanup phase after a malicious script execution. The fact that the same file is created and deleted multiple times might be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's cleaning up temporary files. But the repetition and the specific use of Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore might be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the loading of defender DLLs by PowerShell could be a way to bypass detection, but that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows some suspicious behavior, but it's not conclusive. The classification should be 'INTERESTING' because there are patterns that warrant further investigation, even though they might not be definitively malicious. The confidence is around 0.7 because while there are signs of possible malicious activity, there's no smoking gun.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, though it is not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Interest:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - Multiple entries show files being created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`** directory (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and then deleted. This pattern is common in **malicious scripts** that execute payloads in memory and erase traces.\n   - Similar behavior is observed with `.txt` and `.zip` files in the **`TEMP` directory**, often using `Remove-Item` with `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`, suggesting an attempt to **avoid detection**.\n\n2. **Repetitive Use of `Remove-Item`:**\n   - Over **10+ instances** of `Remove-Item` commands in the `command_line` field (e.g., deleting `tarefa_base.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`, etc.). This could indicate **cleanup after execution** of a script or payload.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Activity:**\n   - **`powershell.exe`** is involved in multiple actions, including **file creation\/deletion**, **registry modifications**, and **process access**. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in this context raises concerns.\n   - **`conhost.exe`** and **`whoami.exe`** are also logged, but these are typically benign unless part of a larger anomalous chain.\n\n4. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **`conhost.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** are linked to **`amsi.dll`** and **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender components). While this could be legitimate, it may also indicate an attempt to **bypass detection mechanisms** (e.g., using Defender DLLs for obfuscation).\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- The **repeated file creation\/deletion** and **aggressive cleanup** are strong indicators of **malicious behavior**, such as:\n  - Executing scripts in memory (e.g., **PowerShell Empire** or **PowerSploit**).\n  - Attempting to **erase evidence** of an attack.\n- The **lack of clear benign context** (e.g., no obvious user-initiated actions or legitimate scripts) increases suspicion.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **\"INTERESTING\"** and should be investigated further. While the logs do not confirm a breach, the **pattern of cleanup and stealthy operations** is highly suggestive of **malicious activity**. A deeper analysis of the system's timeline, user context, and network traffic would be necessary to confirm or rule out compromise.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **70%** (suspicious but not conclusive)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various actions. There's a lot of \"Image loaded\" events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe not always. Then there are several \"File created\" and \"File Delete logged\" events. For example, a file is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That could be a red flag because attackers sometimes create and delete files quickly to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are multiple instances of \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\...\" which are deleting temporary files. That's common in scripts, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it might indicate some automated process or possibly malicious activity. Also, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be normal, but the frequency of these events could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of PowerShell for file operations and registry changes. There's also a \"whoami.exe\" process, which is normal for checking user context, but if that's part of a larger pattern, it could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any clear malicious activity. The events don't show direct attacks, but the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, file creation\/deletion, and loading various DLLs might indicate something. But maybe it's just a script running normally. The confidence here is a bit tricky. If all these events are part of a legitimate script, it's not interesting. But if the pattern is unusual or lacks a clear purpose, it's more suspicious.\n\nConsidering that there are multiple deletions of temp files and the use of PowerShell for various operations, I think there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. The classification would be INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.7. The justification is the combination of PowerShell activities, file creation\/deletion, and loading of various DLLs which could indicate malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and loading of .NET and Windows Defender DLLs, which may indicate automated or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of logs and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is showing.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing a registry value set operation. That's a common activity, but if it's happening a lot, maybe it's normal or maybe not. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe doing the same. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be normal too, but I should note that.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with Process accessed events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The repetition here might be a red flag. Then there are several instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a simple command that shows the current user, which is normal, but if it's called multiple times, maybe in a script, that could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nWait, the whoami.exe entries have the command line as \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\", which is the expected path. So that's normal. But the fact that it's being created multiple times might not be suspicious on its own. However, combined with the PowerShell events, maybe there's something going on.\n\nThen there's an entry for winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate if it's part of a monitoring setup. However, the file path is in the user's Downloads folder, which might be a temporary location. But the filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a configuration file being written. That might be normal during setup.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_ativo.txt. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but the file creation by PowerShell could be part of normal operations or maybe something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: multiple registry changes by Chrome and RuntimeBroker, which might be normal. The repeated PowerShell Process accessed events could indicate someone is interacting with processes, maybe checking permissions or something. The whoami.exe calls might be part of checking user context. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events and the file creation might be part of a legitimate script or could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nBut are there any signs of compromise? The events don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading executables, connecting to suspicious IPs, or modifying critical system files. The user might be running a legitimate application that's modifying the registry and using PowerShell for configuration tasks. However, the repetition of events might be normal depending on the application.\n\nHmm. The classification here is tricky. If all these events are part of normal operations, then it's not interesting. But if there's an unusual pattern, like a lot of registry changes or PowerShell being used in a way that's not typical, that could be a sign. But looking at the data provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The presence of whoami.exe and PowerShell is common in both benign and malicious scenarios. The file creation by winlogbeat seems legitimate, and the other file by PowerShell might be a log or temporary file.\n\nSo, the justification would be that while there are multiple events involving PowerShell and registry changes, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior. Unless there's a context I'm missing, like the user's environment or other logs, but based solely on this batch, it's not clearly interesting. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show common system activities (e.g., Chrome and RuntimeBroker modifying registry values, PowerShell process access, and legitimate file creation by winlogbeat). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
