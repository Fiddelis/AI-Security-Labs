{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple ProcessCreate events with the same command line. The command line includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system, users, and groups. That's suspicious because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, but the combination of these commands might indicate someone is trying to enumerate the system.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events. The files loaded include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. While these are legitimate system files, the fact that they're being loaded by PowerShell might be normal, but I need to check if there's anything unusual. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be part of a download and execution process. The creation and deletion might be an attempt to hide the presence of the script, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line might be redundant or part of a script that's looping. However, the key point is the combination of these activities. Multiple process creations, loading of .NET components, and the creation\/deletion of a temporary script file. This pattern could indicate a malicious actor trying to execute a script that gathers system information, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nI should also consider the number of events. There are several entries, which might indicate ongoing activity. The presence of both ProcessCreate and ImageLoad events, along with the file operations, adds up to a pattern that's more likely to be malicious than benign. However, I need to make sure that this isn't just a legitimate script being run by a user. But given that the command line includes multiple system enumeration commands and the file is created and deleted, it's leaning towards being a security incident. The confidence here would be around 0.85 because while some activities are normal, the combination and the number of events suggest malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list') and creating\/deleting a temporary script file, indicating potential system enumeration or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a PowerShell command that's running a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about user accounts and groups. That's a red flag because enumerating users and groups can be part of reconnaissance in an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for PowerShell processes with different tasks like Pipe Created, Image Loaded, Process Accessed. The Image Load event points to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe not a problem here. But the Process Accessed might be normal unless there's something unusual about it.\n\nNext, there's a process called net.exe and net1.exe running commands like user and localgroup. The use of net1.exe is odd because the standard command is net.exe. Maybe that's a typo or a malicious replacement. That could be a sign of something malicious trying to mimic legitimate processes.\n\nThen, there's a File Created event for a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That might be a configuration file for something, but not necessarily malicious. However, the presence of multiple Security Group Management and User Account Management events could indicate someone is trying to modify group memberships or user accounts, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother File Created event for elemento_logico.txt and a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. The latter might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be used to execute scripts automatically. That's something to watch out for.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set event for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's another potential indicator of compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell commands are gathering system information, there are multiple process creations that might be mimicking legitimate tools, file creations in user directories, and registry changes. All these activities combined could indicate an attacker trying to explore the system, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation. The repeated Security Group Management events might suggest attempts to alter group memberships, which is a common attack vector. The presence of net1.exe instead of net.exe is a bit suspicious. \n\nHowever, some of these events could be legitimate, like normal system management or user activities. But the combination of these events, especially the enumeration commands and the unusual process names, raises enough suspicion to warrant further investigation. So, the answer should be that this is interesting and requires deeper analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a pattern of activities that are **highly suspicious** and warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Enumeration of System Information**\n- **Command Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  net user; get-localuser; get-localgroupmember; cmdkey \/list; ls C:\/Users; get-childitem; dir; net localgroup\n  ```\n- **Implication**:  \n  This is **reconnaissance activity** aimed at gathering details about user accounts, groups, and system resources. Such behavior is commonly associated with **initial access** or **privilege escalation** phases of an attack.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual Process Names and Command-Line Arguments**\n- **`net1.exe` instead of `net.exe`**:  \n  The use of `net1.exe` (a non-standard name) to execute commands like `net localgroup` raises suspicion. This could indicate a **malicious replacement** of legitimate tools or an attempt to evade detection.\n- **`cmdkey.exe \/list`**:  \n  While `cmdkey.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing credentials, its use here may be part of **credential harvesting** or **enumeration**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Creation in User Directories**\n- **Files Created**:  \n  - `elemento_logico.txt` (user's Downloads directory)  \n  - `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (PowerShell startup profile)  \n- **Implication**:  \n  These could be **dropped payloads**, **log files**, or **configuration files** for persistence. The `StartupProfileData` file, in particular, may indicate an attempt to **persist access** via PowerShell profiles.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Events**:  \n  - `Registry value set` for `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`.  \n- **Implication**:  \n  Changes to the registry (e.g., modifying startup paths or execution policies) are often used for **persistence** or **disabling security controls**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Repeated \"Security Group Management\" Events**\n- **Over 20 entries** for `Security Group Management` and `User Account Management` tasks.  \n- **Implication**:  \n  This could indicate an attempt to **modify group memberships** or **escalate privileges**, which is a common tactic in **post-exploitation phases**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Potential Lateral Movement**\n- The combination of **user enumeration**, **file creation**, and **registry changes** suggests the attacker may be **mapping the network** or **establishing footholds** for lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and consistent with **malicious behavior** (e.g., reconnaissance, persistence, privilege escalation). While some events (e.g., `net.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`) are legitimate, the **unusual process names**, **repeated group\/user management tasks**, and **file\/registry modifications** strongly suggest a potential **security incident**.  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Correlate these logs with other telemetry (e.g., network traffic, user behavior).  \n- Investigate the `net1.exe` process and `elemento_logico.txt` file.  \n- Check for unauthorized changes to registry keys and PowerShell profiles.  \n- Consider isolating affected systems and conducting a full forensic analysis.  \n\n⚠️ **This is a high-priority alert requiring immediate investigation.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: RuntimeBroker.exe and Registry value set. That's normal, RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and handles app permissions. Then powershell.exe doing a registry set. PowerShell is common, but if it's modifying registry values, that might be worth noting. But not sure yet.\n\nNext, notepad.exe and svchost.exe also modifying registry. Again, svchost is a standard process, but multiple registry changes could be a sign. Then there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of setup. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which sometimes is used for malicious files. However, the file is a .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during installation.\n\nThen, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Both are legitimate processes, and urlmon.dll is a standard Windows DLL. However, seeing both Calculator.exe and calc.exe (which are the same) might be redundant. Also, the fact that two different processes (calc.exe and Calculator.exe) are loading the same DLL could be a red flag if they are from different sources, but in this case, they're both system paths.\n\nMultiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and process creation. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common admin tool. The presence of whoami.exe being executed is normal, but if it's part of a chain of commands, maybe.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: there are several registry modifications by various processes, including PowerShell, which can be used for persistence or configuration changes. The file creation by winlogbeat in the Downloads directory might be a red flag if it's unexpected, but without more context, it's hard to say. The repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could indicate someone is trying to manipulate or monitor the process, which might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware, like unexpected file downloads, network connections, or unusual command-line arguments. The events are mostly system-related and could be part of normal operations. The confidence is moderate because while there are some suspicious elements, they aren't conclusive on their own. So, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.6, as there are potential signs that warrant further investigation but aren't definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes performing registry modifications and process access events, combined with file creation in the Downloads directory by winlogbeat (potentially indicative of configuration changes or data exfiltration). The repetition of ProcessAccess events for PowerShell raises suspicion of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
