Several command lines indicate the execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with logging to the temp directory, suggesting potential keylogging activity.  The use of different paths (C:\\\\entrada_padrao, C:\\\\modulo_padrao, C:\\\\elemento_base) further points to a potentially larger, targeted operation. The creation and subsequent deletion of a test script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1` also suggests script policy bypass techniques. While `winlogbeat` activity is present, it appears as a separate event, not directly related to the PowerShell activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
