{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log data appears to describe a malicious PowerShell script execution. Let's break it down and identify the concerning activities.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nA PowerShell script was executed.  The script attempts to evade detection, deletes temporary files, modifies the startup profile, likely injects itself into the startup process, and ultimately attempts to communicate (or demonstrate an outcome).  The obfuscation of the actual code using base64 encoding, command line arguments, and other techniques is a clear indicator of malicious intent.\n\n**Detailed Analysis (Chronological Order):**\n\n1. **`whoami.exe`:**  A standard command to check the current user account.  While not inherently malicious, it's often used by attackers to gather information.\n\n2. **PowerShell Script Execution (Base64 Encoded, then Decompressed\/Executed):** This is the core of the attack.  The base64 encoded command is then executed as PowerShell.\n\n   * **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:** This line immediately deletes a zip file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory.  This is a *critical* evasion technique.  The attacker likely used this zip file to transfer the initial script or components. The `-Force` flag bypasses confirmation prompts.\n   * **`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`:**  This line writes \"Final result: 1\" to the console.  This strongly suggests that the script is reporting success and possibly communicating a status.  The '1' likely signifies the completion of a specific task that the attacker wants to monitor.\n   * **`$env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip`:**  The use of an environment variable (`$env:Temp`) combined with a wildcard (`*`) means this script is targeting ALL files in the temporary directory that match the name \"entrada_principal.zip.\"\n\n3. **`Image loads (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc)`:** This points to .NET framework being used.  PowerShell often relies on the .NET framework.\n\n4. **`File Delete logged`:** Delete of temporary script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`  This shows cleanup after initial execution.\n\n5. **`Image loaded (MpClient.dll)`:** Loads the Windows Defender client DLL.  This is suspicious.  The script might be attempting to interact with, disable, or monitor Windows Defender.\n\n6. **`File created (StartupProfileData-NonInteractive)`:** Creates a profile in the non-interactive startup profile.  This is extremely concerning because it ensures the malicious script runs *every* time the user logs in, making it persistent.\n\n7. **`Registry value set`:** Modification of registry values.  The specific keys modified arenâ€™t listed, but this is a common technique for persistence and potentially for disabling security features.\n\n8. **Final `powershell.exe` command:**  Shows the final execution of the script.\n\n**Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:**\n\n* **Base64 Encoding & Complex Command-Line Arguments:** Obfuscation is a hallmark of malicious scripts.\n* **File Deletion:**  Attempting to remove traces of the attacker's activities.\n* **Startup Profile Modification:** Ensures persistence and automatic execution.\n* **Windows Defender Interaction:**  Potentially to disable or evade detection.\n* **Registry Modification:**  For persistence and control.\n* **Reporting 'Final Result':**  Likely used for communication or to confirm completion of a task by the attacker.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Isolate the affected system:** Disconnect from the network immediately.\n* **Full System Scan:** Run a comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scan.\n* **Forensic Analysis:**  Investigate the system to determine the full scope of the compromise (entry point, what data was accessed, etc.).\n* **Examine Startup Profiles:**  Check the startup profiles (Run, RunOnce, Startup) for any suspicious entries.\n* **Monitor Network Traffic:** Look for unusual network connections.\n* **Review Registry Keys:**  Carefully review recently modified registry keys, particularly those related to startup and security settings.\n* **Update Security Software:** Ensure that all security software is up-to-date.\n* **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious attachments and clicking on unknown links.\n\n\n\nThis detailed analysis should provide a good understanding of the potential threat and guide remediation efforts.  A security professional should be involved to handle the investigation and recovery."}
