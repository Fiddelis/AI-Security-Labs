This, combined with PowerShell creating a new file ('objeto_padrao.txt'), and chrome also exhibiting multiple registry modifications, suggests potential reconnaissance or initial stages of an attack. The `Special Logon` event further raises suspicion. While some events are benign, the overall combination warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
