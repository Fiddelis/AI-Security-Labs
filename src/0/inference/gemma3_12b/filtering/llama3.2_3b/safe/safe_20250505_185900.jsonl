While not definitively malicious, this activity is characteristic of reconnaissance or initial stages of exploitation. The creation of temporary files and rapid deletion is also suspicious. The presence of winlogbeat activity alongside PowerShell suggests potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
