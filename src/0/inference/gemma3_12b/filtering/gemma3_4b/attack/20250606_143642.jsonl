{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data. It appears to be a series of events related to a PowerShell script execution, likely malicious.  Here's a consolidated analysis, highlighting key observations and potential implications:\n\n**1. Initial Activity & PowerShell Invocation:**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe`:**  The execution starts with `whoami.exe`. This is a common tactic by attackers to identify the current user context. It helps them determine what privileges they have.\n*   **`powershell.exe` (Multiple Instances):**  There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` involved. This suggests a script or a series of commands are being run.\n*   **Registry Modifications:**  `powershell.exe` performs registry value set operations.  This could be changing PowerShell's execution policy, importing modules, or modifying other settings to facilitate malicious actions.\n\n**2.  File Management & Cleanup (Suspicious):**\n\n*   **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:** This is a *very* suspicious line within a PowerShell command. It's attempting to delete a ZIP file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" located in the user's temporary directory.  The `-Force` parameter ensures the deletion happens without confirmation. This could be an attempt to remove evidence of the malicious payload that was initially downloaded. It strongly indicates that a ZIP file containing potentially malicious code was present and being cleaned up.\n\n**3.  .NET Framework Dependencies:**\n\n*   **`mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`, `clr.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`:** These DLLs indicate that the PowerShell script heavily relies on the .NET Framework. This is common for more sophisticated PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes and objects.\n*   **`MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Component):** The loading of this file from the Windows Defender Platform directory is interesting. It may be a legitimate part of the script, or it could be used for obfuscation or to avoid detection by Defender itself.\n\n**4. Script Policy Testing and File Creation\/Deletion:**\n\n*   **`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:**  The script creates and immediately deletes this file. This strongly suggests the script is testing PowerShell's script execution policy. Attackers often do this to determine if they can run unsigned or restricted scripts. The unusual file name likely employs a random or generated string to make it harder to track.\n\n**Summary of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **`entrada_principal.zip`:** The name of a ZIP file potentially containing malware, being deleted.\n*   **`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:**  A test script quickly created and deleted, indicative of policy bypass attempts.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Modifications (implied):** The creation and deletion of the test script, along with the reliance on .NET, strongly implies changes to the script execution policy to allow the malicious PowerShell to run.\n*   **.NET Framework Dependencies:**  The script uses .NET libraries, potentially for obfuscation, data manipulation, or communication.\n*   **Windows Defender Component Usage:** `MpOAV.dll` usage might be legitimate but needs further investigation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  The presence of PowerShell activity, file deletion, and .NET dependencies warrants immediate investigation using an EDR solution.\n2.  **User Account Analysis:**  Examine the `fiddelis` user account's activity.  Look for other suspicious processes or network connections.\n3.  **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Monitor network traffic originating from the system for unusual connections or data exfiltration.\n4.  **PowerShell Audit Logs:** Enable PowerShell logging (Module Logging and Script Block Logging) to capture more details about PowerShell scripts. This will provide more information in the future.\n5.  **Review Execution Policies:** Check PowerShell execution policies to make sure they are set to the most restrictive settings possible.\n6.  **Scan for Malware:** Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/anti-malware signatures.\n7.  **Isolate the System:** If you suspect a compromise, isolate the system from the network to prevent further spread.\n8.  **Examine System Configuration:** Review system configuration settings, especially those related to PowerShell and .NET, for any unauthorized changes.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious event. Prompt investigation is critical.  The deletion of the ZIP file and the testing of the PowerShell execution policy are particularly worrying and point to an attempt to hide malicious activity."}
