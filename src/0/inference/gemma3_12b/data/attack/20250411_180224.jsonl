The scripts referenced (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1') suggest attempted execution of non-existent files, possibly indicative of reconnaissance or incomplete attacks.  The presence of scheduled tasks named 'win32times' and the registry modifications also warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
