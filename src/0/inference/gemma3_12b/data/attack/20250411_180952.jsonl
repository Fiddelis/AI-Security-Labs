The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for these actions is also concerning. The creation of temporary files by svchost and potential script execution in PowerShell raise further red flags. Multiple Chrome network connections and registry modifications add to the suspicion. The attempts to create a winlogbeat configuration file, along with creating various temporary files, suggest a possible attack chain or post-exploitation activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
