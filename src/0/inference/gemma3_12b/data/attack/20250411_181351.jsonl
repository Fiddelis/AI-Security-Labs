Repeated instances of PowerShell scripts saving screenshots to the temporary directory (`$env:TEMP`) using `System.Windows.Forms` are highly suspicious.  Additionally, temporary PowerShell script files are created and subsequently deleted, which is a common tactic to evade detection.  Remote command execution logs further contribute to the concerning pattern.
