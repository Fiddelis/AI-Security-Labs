{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This log data appears to be from a Windows system, collected by the Winlogbeat tool. The logs are categorized into various events such as process creation, image loading, network connections, and registry changes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of some key observations:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: A process called \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" is observed to be running multiple times (at least 4 instances). It attempts to access images loaded from its own directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`) and creates several network connections.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat Log Collection**: The log also captures the execution of Winlogbeat, a tool used for collecting Windows event logs and forwarding them to various data platforms like Elasticsearch or Splunk. It creates an executable process under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64`.\n\n3. **PowerShell Usage**: The logs also mention PowerShell, indicating that it might be used for scripting tasks on the system.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Log Creation**: Winlogbeat is observed creating a log file under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs`.\n\n5. **RuntimeBroker Activity**: A process called RuntimeBroker.exe sets registry values, which could be related to Microsoft's runtime broker service used for app management.\n\n6. **Multiple Process Termination Events**: The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe processes are repeatedly terminated (at least 4 instances).\n\n7. **Network Connection Detection**: Network connections associated with the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process are detected by Winlogbeat.\n\nThese observations suggest that there may be ongoing processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and some background system activities, possibly for data collection or management purposes. However, without more context about what these actions indicate (e.g., whether they are legitimate system maintenance tasks or malicious behavior), it's challenging to draw conclusions about their intent."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from an Elastic Stack system, specifically from a Beats instance (likely Filebeat) that is collecting Windows event logs. The log contains a series of events that are being reported by the operating system.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different types of events:\n\n1. **Process creation and termination**: Events with \"Process Create\" or \"Process Terminate\" indicate that a new process was started or an existing one terminated.\n2. **File operations**: Events with \"File created\", \"File deleted\", or \"File modified\" indicate changes to files on the system.\n3. **Registry modifications**: Events with \"Registry value set\" or \"Registry value delete\" indicate changes to registry entries.\n4. **Network activity**: Events with \"Dns query\" or \"Pipe Created\" indicate network-related activities, such as DNS lookups or pipe creation.\n5. **System events**: Events with \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and \"Path:C:\\Windows\\Logs\\\" are system-generated logs that provide information about the operating system's activity.\n\nSome specific observations from this log:\n\n* There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, which may indicate an automated update process.\n* The `svchost.exe` process is frequently creating new files in the `DeliveryOptimization` directory.\n* The `Explorer.EXE` process is setting registry values.\n* The `setup.exe` process is being executed from a temporary folder (`EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp`), which may indicate an installation or update process.\n\nThese are just some general observations, and without more context, it's difficult to provide specific insights into the system's behavior. If you have concerns about the system's performance or security, I recommend reviewing the log file in more detail or seeking assistance from a qualified IT professional."}
