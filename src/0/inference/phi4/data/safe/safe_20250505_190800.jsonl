{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands executed, coupled with file creation and deletion in temporary directories. This pattern could indicate script-based malicious activity or policy testing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\nThe batch includes several events indicating the use of PowerShell for various tasks, including process and image loading. Notably, a PowerShell command created a file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1`) in a temporary directory, which was then deleted shortly after. This kind of activity often hints at script execution that might be testing or bypassing security policies. Additionally, the frequent use of `Provider Lifecycle` and other PowerShell-related events suggest potential automation or scripting efforts that warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent. The presence of these patterns increases the likelihood that this batch is worth investigating for possible security incidents."}
