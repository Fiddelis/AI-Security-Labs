{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell and SSH processes, including frequent file creations and deletions in temporary directories, network connections, and image loads of potentially sensitive system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\nThe batch contains several events that are indicative of potential malicious behavior:\n\n1. **Frequent File Creation and Deletion**: There are multiple instances where a file is created and then deleted in the temporary directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`). This can be a tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: The `powershell.exe` process is involved in numerous actions, including image loading of system files like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mpoav.dll`. PowerShell is often leveraged for scripting attacks due to its powerful capabilities and native presence on Windows systems.\n\n3. **SSH Connections**: There are events related to SSH connections (`ssh.exe`) which could indicate remote access attempts, especially if these connections occur from unusual or untrusted locations.\n\n4. **Registry and Network Events**: Although less directly suspicious, the registry value set by `Explorer.EXE` and network connection detections add context that might suggest system configuration changes or data exfiltration activities.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events raises suspicion of unauthorized or malicious activity on the system, warranting further investigation."}
