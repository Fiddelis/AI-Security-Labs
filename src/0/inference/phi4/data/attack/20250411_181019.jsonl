Notably, there are processes creating services (win32times) with non-existent script paths using commands like `sc create` and `start`, which is a common tactic used by malware to establish persistence. Additionally, repeated registry value sets by various executables such as 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' suggest attempts at modifying system settings or hiding processes. These patterns combined warrant further investigation for potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
