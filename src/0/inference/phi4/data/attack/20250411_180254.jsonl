{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry events associated with chrome.exe suggest potential unauthorized configuration changes, which could indicate malicious behavior. Additionally, image loading of 'amsi.dll' by chrome.exe is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it may be an attempt to bypass Windows Defender.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Registry Events with `chrome.exe`:** The batch contains numerous instances where registry values are set via `chrome.exe`. While it's possible for legitimate software and scripts running under Chrome to modify the registry, such repeated modifications are unusual and warrant investigation.\n\n2. **Image Loading by `chrome.exe`:** A specific event shows an image of `amsi.dll` being loaded by `chrome.exe`. This is suspicious because `chrome.exe` typically does not load system DLLs like `amsi.dll`, which is used for antivirus capabilities in Windows. An attacker might attempt to manipulate or disable this component, indicating a potential threat.\n\n3. **Other Processes:** While other events involve normal activities such as file creation by `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe`, these do not inherently suggest malicious behavior unless additional context (e.g., the content of created files) indicates otherwise.\n\nGiven these points, especially the suspicious image loading and frequent registry changes tied to a web browser executable, there is enough concern to classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation. The confidence level reflects that while some actions could be benign in different contexts, their combination here suggests possible malicious intent."}
