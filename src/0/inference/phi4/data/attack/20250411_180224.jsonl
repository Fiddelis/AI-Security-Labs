PowerShell and cmd.exe are used to create scheduled tasks with the intention of running a non-existing script, which suggests an attempt to hide or prepare for execution of malicious code (schtasks.exe creation events). Additionally, there is significant use of 'svchost.exe' for setting registry values multiple times, combined with file creation in system directories.
