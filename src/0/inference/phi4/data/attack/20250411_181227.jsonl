{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to create scheduled tasks with high privileges, which could indicate potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Repeated Actions**: Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` creating scheduled tasks using the `New-ScheduledTaskAction`, `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger`, and `Register-ScheduledTask`. This pattern is repeated with different task names, suggesting automation or scripting.\n\n2. **High Privileges**: The tasks are set to run under the `BUILTIN\\\\Administrators` group at logon with the highest run level, which could be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence or execute actions with elevated privileges.\n\n3. **Potential Malicious Indicators**: Although the action executed is `calc.exe`, a benign application, the method used (scheduling tasks with high privileges) can be misused for malicious purposes such as executing harmful scripts or maintaining persistent access.\n\n4. **Other Processes**: The presence of other processes like `chrome.exe` and various `.dll` files loaded by PowerShell could indicate further investigation into potential lateral movement or additional command execution paths.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" for a detailed security review to rule out any malicious activities. The confidence level reflects the strong indicators present in the log entries."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains several indicators of potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell for creating and deleting a script file, as well as setting up scheduled tasks to run 'calc.exe' at logon under the Administrators group, are suspicious behaviors often associated with persistence mechanisms or malware obfuscation tactics. Additionally, numerous events related to executing remote commands suggest potential command-and-control activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious activities such as repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, an unusual PowerShell activity creating files in user directories, and multiple DNS queries from Chrome.exe. These patterns are often associated with malicious behavior or compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated Registry Modifications**: The `svchost.exe` process is known to be legitimate but can be exploited by malware. Multiple entries of registry value sets from this process could indicate unauthorized modifications.\n\n2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: `powershell.exe` creating files in user directories like AppData and Downloads, especially with names suggesting startup scripts or auxiliary tasks, raises suspicion as it may be used for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **DNS Queries from Chrome.exe**: While not inherently malicious, DNS queries from a browser process can indicate attempts to resolve domains associated with command-and-control servers if other indicators suggest compromise.\n\n4. **Multiple File Creations and Registry Changes by Chrome.exe**: This could signify an exploitation attempt through the browser, possibly indicating drive-by downloads or browser-based malware.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity**: The repeated creation of files related to winlogbeat suggests either legitimate monitoring setup activities or potential misuse for log manipulation.\n\nGiven these points, the batch presents several red flags consistent with malicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Confidence is high due to multiple indicators aligning with known attack patterns, though not absolute certainty without additional context."}
