{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLL files and an executable named DismHost.exe are detected in a temporary directory, suggesting potential tampering or the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated Detection**: The logs show multiple detections of `Dism.exe` running from a temporary folder with various DLLs being loaded. This pattern is unusual and warrants further investigation as it could indicate an attempt to misuse legitimate tools like DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) for malicious activities.\n\n2. **Use of Temporary Directory**: Execution from the `Temp` directory, especially involving multiple components (`ProvProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`, etc.), can be a red flag. Legitimate uses typically don't involve such complex setups in temporary locations unless specifically configured by an admin for certain tasks.\n\n3. **Command Line Evidence**: The presence of a command line execution involving `DismHost.exe` suggests that this executable is being used with specific parameters, potentially indicating automated or scripted actions which might be part of a larger malicious campaign.\n\n4. **Image Load Events**: Several image load events related to `DismHost.exe` and various DLLs indicate dynamic loading and potential use of these components for further operations, possibly including privilege escalation, persistence, or other nefarious activities.\n\n5. **Potential Abuse of DISM**: DISM is a powerful tool used for servicing Windows images, but its misuse can lead to significant security risks. The unusual context (temporary directory, multiple DLLs) raises suspicion about possible abuse of this utility.\n\nGiven these points, the batch shows signs that could indicate malicious behavior and therefore should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation. The confidence level is high at 0.9 due to the strong indicators present in the logs, though some uncertainty remains due to lack of context beyond the events themselves."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log appears to be a series of JSON-formatted entries related to processes and Windows events on a computer system. Here's an analysis of the key components in these logs:\n\n1. **Process Information**:\n   - The `process` field details information about specific executables running on the system, such as `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc.\n   - Each process entry may include attributes like the name of the executable and its command line arguments (e.g., for a PowerShell script).\n\n2. **Winlog Events**:\n   - The `winlog` field contains information about Windows event logs related to system activities, such as \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", \"Image loaded\", etc.\n   - Each log entry is associated with a specific task or rule that describes the nature of the logged event (e.g., \"RegistryEvent\" for registry changes).\n\n3. **File Information**:\n   - The `file` field provides details about files involved in the processes, such as paths to DLLs (`taskschd.dll`) or file actions like creation and deletion.\n   - Some entries indicate when a file is not involved (e.g., `\"None\"`), which might mean that the event does not pertain directly to a specific file.\n\n4. **Repeated Entries**:\n   - Certain log entries, particularly those involving PowerShell commands for service management, are repeated multiple times. This could be indicative of automated script execution or configuration tasks being performed repeatedly on the system.\n\n5. **Specific Observations**:\n   - The use of PowerShell scripts to create and start services (e.g., `\"New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"...\"`) suggests administrative actions, possibly for deploying applications or modifying system behavior.\n   - The absence of specific file paths in some entries might indicate events that are triggered by configurations rather than direct file interactions.\n\nThis log is typically useful for security monitoring and analysis as it can help identify unauthorized activities, potential malware execution, or configuration changes within a networked environment. If analyzing these logs for security purposes, it would be essential to correlate this data with known good behavior patterns and investigate any anomalies or suspicious entries further."}
