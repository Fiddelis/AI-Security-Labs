Additionally, the use of 'sc.exe' to start a service ('wuauserv') is notable as it may imply an attempt to manipulate system updates. The loading of specific DLLs ('amsi.dll', 'MpOAV.dll') by 'chrome.exe' raises concerns about possible evasion techniques being tested against antivirus or anti-malware defenses. Powershell activity related to process access could be benign but warrants further investigation due to its association with scripting in both legitimate and malicious contexts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
