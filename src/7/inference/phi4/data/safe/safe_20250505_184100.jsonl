These processes are performing expected operations such as process creation, access, and file manipulation associated with installing or updating the Discord application.\n\n2. **Legitimate File Paths**: All mentioned files and directories correspond to standard locations for user data and program installation (e.g., AppData, Start Menu). There is no indication of unusual paths that might suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Expected Behaviors**:\n   - `Discord.exe` processes are involved in loading necessary libraries like `ffmpeg.dll`, `d3dcompiler_47.dll`, and `libGLESv2.dll`, which are commonly used by Discord for media processing and rendering.\n   - `Update.exe` is creating shortcuts on the Start Menu and Desktop, a typical behavior during installation or updates.\n\n4. **No Suspicious Activities**: The sequence of events does not show any signs of unauthorized access attempts, unusual command-line arguments that suggest exploitation, or modification of critical system files outside expected directories.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: Given the consistency with known legitimate software operations and absence of red flags typically associated with malicious activities (such as unexpected process behavior or file path anomalies), there is a high level of confidence in classifying this batch as not interesting for further investigation."}
