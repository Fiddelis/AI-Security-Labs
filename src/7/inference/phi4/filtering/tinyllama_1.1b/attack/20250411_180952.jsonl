Additionally, there are multiple registry value set operations by powershell.exe and conhost.exe, which could indicate an attempt to modify system settings persistently. The repeated creation of a file at C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\sru\\\\SRUtmp.log is also suspicious as it might be related to logging or obfuscating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
