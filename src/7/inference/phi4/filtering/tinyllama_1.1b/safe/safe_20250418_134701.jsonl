This indicates development or dependency management activities rather than malicious behavior.\n\n- **Pattern Consistency**: All events share the same task (`\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"`) with identical context, implying a non-anomalous batch of log entries related to routine operations in software development.\n\nGiven these observations, there's no indication of suspicious activity or anomalies that would warrant further investigation."}
