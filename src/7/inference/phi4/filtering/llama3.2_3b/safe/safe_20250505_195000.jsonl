This behavior might suggest DLL hijacking or other malware tactics.\n\n2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**\n   - A new file creation in the temp directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`) by `powershell.exe` suggests potential script execution that might be benign or malicious.\n   - PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be leveraged to execute and hide malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Multiple Image Load Events:**\n   - The image load events involving various DLLs, including those from known paths (e.g., `windows defender`), are generally normal unless associated with suspicious processes like `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **Pipeline Creation:** \n   - The `Pipe Created` event by PowerShell could be part of inter-process communication, which is not inherently malicious but can be used for data exfiltration.\n\nOverall, the combination of these events suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activity that warrants further investigation."}
