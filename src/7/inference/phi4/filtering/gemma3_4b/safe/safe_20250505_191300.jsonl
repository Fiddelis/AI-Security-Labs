These include file creation, image loading (loading of libraries), registry changes, process access, and network connections.\n\n2. **Process Name**: All events are related to `Discord.exe`, a well-known legitimate application used for communication.\n\n3. **File Paths and Network Activity**: The paths mentioned (e.g., within AppData) are consistent with normal application behavior. Network activity is expected as Discord needs to connect to its servers.\n\n4. **No Indicators of Malicious Behavior**: There are no unusual or suspicious activities, such as unexpected file modifications, unknown process behaviors, or connections to known malicious IP addresses.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: High confidence in this classification because the events align with typical legitimate application behavior without red flags indicative of malicious activity."}
