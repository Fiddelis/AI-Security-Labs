These include image loads (DLLs), pipe creation, process access, and file creation for shortcuts.\n\n2. **No Malicious Indicators**:\n   - There are no signs of unauthorized or unusual command-line arguments.\n   - No external or unexpected files being loaded outside of the standard Discord directory.\n   - The processes involve normal operations such as network utility tasks, which are expected in a communication app like Discord.\n\n3. **Typical Operations**: Creating shortcuts and accessing processes repeatedly is consistent with legitimate user behavior when interacting with applications like Discord. These activities do not suggest compromise or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: Given the consistency of these events with normal application operations and no presence of typical indicators of compromise, the confidence level in classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" is high at 0.95."}
