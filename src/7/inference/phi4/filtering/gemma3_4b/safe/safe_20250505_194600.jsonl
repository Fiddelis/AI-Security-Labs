While most events involve legitimate processes like svchost.exe, notepad.exe, and winlogbeat.exe performing routine tasks such as DNS queries, file creation, and image loading, there are notable anomalies. The use of rundll32.exe with an unusual command line that embeds a local server run DLL is potentially suspicious as it may be used for malicious purposes like privilege escalation or execution of arbitrary code. Additionally, repetitive file creation events by winlogbeat.exe suggest automation or scripting, which warrants further investigation to rule out potential misuse.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
