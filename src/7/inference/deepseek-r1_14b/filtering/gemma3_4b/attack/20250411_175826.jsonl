{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. I'm new to cybersecurity, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I see there are a lot of log entries—more than 20. Each entry has a process name, some Windows log task, and maybe a file path. The goal is to determine if the entire batch should be looked into further.\n\nLooking at the first few events: all are from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. Chrome doing DNS queries and connecting to networks is normal, especially since it's a browser that needs to access websites. So these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an entry for powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell can do a lot of things, both good and bad. Accessing processes could be part of legitimate script execution or something malicious like lateral movement. I'll need to see more context here.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run. Whoami is usually used to check user information, so unless it's being abused with some command-line argument, this might not be too concerning. But looking at the command line, it's just the default path: \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". No signs of tampering here.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used in persistence mechanisms by malware. Repeated writes might indicate something is being configured, possibly for malicious purposes. Also, the command line shows some PowerShell scripts trying to set LastWriteTime on certain files to a very old date (01\/01\/1970). That seems unusual because why would someone want to change file timestamps that far back? It could be an attempt to hide activity or interfere with tracking.\n\nAnother event has powershell.exe creating and then deleting a temp file. Creating temporary files is normal, but immediately deleting them might be suspicious—maybe trying to remove evidence of some action. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1 sounds like it's related to script testing or policy enforcement, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .NET framework files and other DLLs. That seems normal because PowerShell uses these libraries for execution. Not sure if that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the later entries, there are processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes. These seem less concerning on their own. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows for managing runtime aspects, and Notepad is just an editor—both doing normal tasks here.\n\nThe last two entries have powershell.exe running with command lines similar to previous ones, targeting different file paths in C:\\modulo_logico and other directories. Again, these are setting LastWriteTime on specific files to the same old date.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying registry values, creating and deleting temp script files, and changing timestamps on various files. These actions could be part of a legitimate administrative script, but they also resemble behaviors seen in malware for persistence, data tampering, or hiding evidence.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being suspicious because the combination of actions—especially the repeated file timestamp modifications and process access—doesn't seem like normal user activity. It would probably be wise to investigate further, maybe look into what exactly these scripts are doing, check if any new processes were started, and review network traffic around that time.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log entries exhibits several behaviors that may warrant investigation, particularly due to the activities involving powershell.exe:\n\n1. **Multiple Process Accesses**: Powershell.exe accessing processes multiple times could indicate legitimate scripting or potential malicious activity such as lateral movement.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Repeated writes to the registry by powershell.exe might be part of a persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain access across reboots.\n\n3. **File Timestamp Manipulation**: The command lines show attempts to set file LastWriteTimes to an old date (01\/01\/1970), which could be an attempt to obscure the files' true modification times, often seen in malicious activities to evade detection.\n\n4. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**: The creation and immediate deletion of a temp script file might suggest efforts to remove evidence of some action, raising suspicion about the intent behind the script's execution.\n\n5. **ImageLoad Events**: While normal for PowerShell to load various libraries, these events alone don't indicate malicious activity but should be monitored in conjunction with other behaviors.\n\n6. **Activities Across Different Directories**: The scripts target multiple directories (C:\\modulo_logico, C:\\unidade_logico) and files, which might indicate a broader scope of operations that could be concerning.\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the combination of process access, registry modifications, file timestamp changes, and temporary file handling, these activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these scripts and their impact on system security."}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where PowerShell is being used with commands that modify file timestamps. The command lines show `Get-ChildItem` and setting the LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970\", which looks like an attempt to change file metadata, possibly to hide activity or make files appear older. This could be suspicious because changing timestamps is often part of data tampering.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where `svchost.exe` and `Calculator.exe` are setting registry values. Since svchost is a common process but can be used maliciously, especially if it's modifying unexpected registry keys, this might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes that shouldn't happen normally.\n\nThere's also an event with `winlogbeat.exe`, which I recognize as part of the ELK stack for log management. The file path mentioned seems legitimate, so maybe not a red flag on its own unless it's accessing unexpected files or behaving abnormally.\n\nI see `powershell.exe` being launched multiple times with different command lines. Some of these are modifying various text files across different directories, which could be part of a script trying to clean traces or alter logs post-activity. The fact that each event targets a different file might indicate a broader cleanup operation.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry writes by processes like `Calculator.exe` and `svchost.exe`. Registry changes can be indicators of malicious activity, such as creating persistence points for malware to run at startup or altering system configurations to hide processes.\n\nThe events with `chrome.exe` involve pipe creation and multiple registry writes. While Chrome is a common application, unusual pipe activities or excessive registry interactions could hint at either legitimate but unexpected behavior or potential exploitation, especially if combined with other suspicious actions.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell to alter file timestamps on various files across different paths suggests an attempt to manipulate the filesystem in a way that's not typical user activity. This could be part of data exfiltration, log deletion, or installing persistent malware. The combination with registry modifications and process activity from known legitimate processes (like Calculator.exe) using svchost.exe adds layers that might indicate a more sophisticated attack.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities are normal system operations. However, given the frequency and varied targets of the file modifications and registry changes, it's unlikely to be routine maintenance or user behavior. The use of PowerShell in such a way is often a red flag because it's powerful for both legitimate scripting and malicious purposes.\n\nTherefore, while there might not be a single smoking gun here, the pattern of multiple suspicious activities across different processes and files raises concern. It's possible that an attacker is using these techniques to hide their presence or establish persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - `powershell.exe` is used in several events with commands altering file timestamps, which could indicate tampering with evidence.\n\n2. **Analyze File Timestamp Modifications:**\n   - The command lines show attempts to set LastWriteTime to a very old date, suggesting an effort to make files appear unchanged or older than they are.\n\n3. **Registry Changes by Various Processes:**\n   - `svchost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, and others making registry modifications may be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\n4. **Filesystem Activity:**\n   - Multiple writes across various directories by PowerShell could signal data manipulation, possibly to erase traces of prior activity.\n\n5. **Considerations for Each Process:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` is legitimate but should be monitored if it's accessing unexpected files.\n   - `chrome.exe` showing multiple registry writes might indicate suspicious behavior if unrelated to normal operation.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The combination of file modifications, registry changes, and process activity points towards potential malicious intent rather than routine operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs show a concerning pattern of activities that could be indicative of malicious behavior, particularly the use of PowerShell to alter file timestamps and multiple processes making registry modifications. These actions may suggest an attacker attempting to hide their presence or establish persistence on the system. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to determine if these activities are part of a cyber-attack.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"detected_anomalies\": [\n    {\n      \"process\": \"powershell.exe\",\n      \"activity\": \"Modifying file timestamps across multiple directories.\",\n      \"risk_assessment\": \"High\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"svchost.exe\",\n      \"activity\": \"Multiple registry modifications.\",\n      \"risk_assessment\": \"Medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"Calculator.exe\",\n      \"activity\": \"Registry writes and other activities.\",\n      \"risk_assessment\": \"Low-Medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"chrome.exe\",\n      \"activity\": \"Excessive registry writes and pipe creation.\",\n      \"risk_assessment\": \"Medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_risk\": \"High\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Investigate all processes for signs of malicious activity, particularly focusing on file timestamp changes and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to analyzing logs, but I'll do my best.\n\nSo, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event. Let's go through them one by one and see what they're showing.\n\nThe first event shows that chrome.exe set a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings. The next few events also show similar actions from chrome.exe, either setting registry values or loading certain DLL files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These look like standard operations; amsi is related to antivirus scanning, and MpOAV might be part of Windows Defender.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect these logs, so it makes sense that it creates some configuration files. That doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThe next event catches my attention: powershell.exe created a file called unidade_logico.txt. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities because of its scripting capabilities. The filename translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, which isn't inherently bad, but the creation by PowerShell could be something to look into.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe sets registry values repeatedly—12 times in total. That's a lot. While Chrome does update settings, so many repeated writes might indicate some kind of automated process or possibly malicious activity trying to establish persistence. Maybe each write is an attempt to set the same value over and over, which could be part of an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated registry writes by chrome.exe are a red flag. Malicious actors often use legitimate tools like browsers or system utilities for their activities because they're less likely to be suspicious. The combination of these registry changes and the file creation by PowerShell adds more concern. Even though each individual event might not be overtly malicious, the pattern—especially the extensive registry activity—suggests something isn't right.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is an actual attack or just some unusual behavior from Chrome, maybe due to an extension or update. But given that Chrome is such a common process and these events are happening in bulk, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events shows multiple instances where the chrome.exe process is setting registry values repeatedly, which could indicate potential malicious activity attempting persistence. Additionally, powershell.exe created a file, raising suspicion due to its scripting capabilities often used in attacks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple repeated registry writes by chrome.exe and a file creation by powershell.exe, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
