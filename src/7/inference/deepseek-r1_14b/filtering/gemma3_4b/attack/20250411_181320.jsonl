Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do a lot of that. But then I see powershell.exe showing up multiple times. Powershell can be good for legitimate admin tasks but is also often used in attacks.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, some have command lines with script blocks like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. Those commands list files and directories recursively, which could be part of a system exploration or data exfiltration. The fact that it's creating and then deleting a temporary PS1 file might indicate an attempt to execute scripts without persistence.\n\nThere are also registry accesses and modifications. Registry changes can be used by malware to maintain persistence between reboots, so that raises a flag. Plus, the repeated 'Process Create' events for powershell could mean something is spawning it multiple times or trying different ways to run commands.\n\nThe image loads from various .NET frameworks and defender components seem normal, but combined with other actions, they might be part of loading malicious modules or obfuscating activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions, file creation\/deletion in temp folder, registry access. These could be signs of malicious activity trying to stay hidden and persistent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, including system enumeration commands and file operations in the temp directory, combined with registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, each line being a separate JSON object. Each event seems to have three main components: process information, Windows log task details, and file information. \n\nLooking through the events, I notice that many of them involve processes like powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc. The tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process accessed, Logon, Special Logon, and User Account Management.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading an image (MpClient.dll) which seems normal because Windows Defender uses PowerShell. Then there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management software. Next, there's a command line for powershell.exe that includes some commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem, which could be legitimate but sometimes used in scripts or malicious activities.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe creates files, which isn't unusual on its own, but the specific paths might need attention. For instance, creating a file named 'objeto_principal.txt'â€”I'm not sure what that is, but it's worth looking into if it's related to known malicious activity.\n\nThe registry value sets across various processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, etc., could be concerning because attackers often use the Registry for persistence. The fact that multiple different processes are modifying the registry might indicate either normal system operation or potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several events with 'User Account Management' tasks and some 'Special Logon' events, which could relate to user login activities or privilege escalations. These are definitely areas to monitor for signs of unauthorized access.\n\nThe last few entries show processes accessing the registry (like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe), which might seem benign but could be part of a larger campaign if done in conjunction with other activities.\n\nPutting it all together, while some individual events look normal, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances, file creations, registry modifications across various legitimate-looking processes, and repeated User Account Management tasks raises flags. This could indicate scripting or automated processes that might be attempting to maintain persistence or escalate privileges, which are common in attack campaigns.\n\nI'm also considering if these events span a short period, as a series of actions within a short timeframe is more suspicious than isolated ones. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe with command lines that involve directory traversal (ls -recurse) could be a red flag for lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple concerning activities that together suggest potential malicious behavior, even if individual events aren't necessarily suspicious on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell.exe instances with file creation and registry activity, repeated User Account Management tasks, and potentially suspicious command-line arguments, suggesting possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nThere are four events in total. Each event has three components: process, winlog, and file. Looking at the first line, the process is calc.exe, which is a common system calculator. The winlog says 'Image loaded', so that means it's loading a DLL or some module. The file path points to C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. That seems a bit unusual because I don't think calc.exe typically needs urlmon.dll.\n\nThe next two lines both have svchost.exe as the process, which is a known system process that runs various services. Each of these events shows 'Registry value set', and there's no file associated with them since the file field is None. That could mean they're modifying registry settings for normal operations, but I'm not sure if it's suspicious or just standard behavior.\n\nThe fourth event again has Calculator.exe as the process, similar to the first one. The winlog task is 'Image loaded', and the file is urlmon.dll in the same path. So both instances of calc.exe and Calculator.exe are loading the same DLL from the system32 directory.\n\nNow, I'm wondering why these processes would be loading urlmon.dll. Usually, that's related to URL handling or ActiveX controls. Maybe they're trying to inject some code or load a malicious component. Since there are two instances of similar events with the same file path, it could indicate an attempt to run the same payload twice, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nI'm also considering if these actions are legitimate. Sometimes system processes do need to load certain DLLs, but I don't recall calc.exe needing urlmon.dll for its normal operation. The fact that both Calculator and Calculator.exe (which is different) are involved adds some concern because it's not just one process but two.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't too high yet, maybe around 0.7, because while the repeated loading of an unexpected DLL is concerning, there could be legitimate reasons, though rare. The events involving svchost.exe modifying the registry might be part of normal operations or could also be malicious. However, combined with the other two events, it's enough to raise suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of processes loading unusual DLLs and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
