Let me start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do a lot of that activity. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I notice powershell.exe appearing several times. The first occurrence has a command line with a WebClient.DownloadFile call pointing to a GitHub URL. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for scripting and downloading files can be part of malicious activities. The file paths in the TEMP directory also seem unusual; why would a script need to write there?\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes, sets registry values, and loads images. These actions could be indicators of malicious behavior because they involve system changes and process manipulation. Additionally, the repeated ImageLoad events might suggest it's loading modules that could be harmful.\n\nThe file operations show a script being created and then immediately deleted in the TEMP directory. This quick file creation and deletion is a common tactic to avoid detection. It makes me think this could be part of an exploit or payload delivery.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where powershell.exe uses WebClient.DownloadFile with different URLs from various GitHub repositories. Each time, it's saving files to the TEMP folder with names like entrada_comum.txt, tarefa_auxiliar.txt, etc. This pattern suggests automated downloading and execution, which is often seen in command-and-control or dropper activities.\n\nThe use of raw.githubusercontent.com domains seems suspicious because such sites can be used to host malicious scripts temporarily. The fact that each download is from a different repository under varying names might indicate an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of downloading files via PowerShell, saving them to TEMP, and deleting quickly are red flags for potential malware or script execution. Additionally, the repeated process activity in powershell.exe could be part of a larger attack chain, such as establishing persistence or deploying further malicious payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file downloads from GitHub and temporary file operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files under different branches and modules. This could be concerning because downloading files directly from such sources might indicate data gathering or potential malicious activity.\n\nThere are also several events showing registry value sets and file creations related to Chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and others. However, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks for Chrome might just be normal operations unless they're out of the ordinary for that process. \n\nNotably, I notice that some processes like MpDefenderCoreService.exe have network connections. Since this is part of Windows Defender, it's expected behavior, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple events where winlogbeat.exe creates files in a specific path, which seems related to log shipping or data collection tools. If winlogbeat is running legitimately, these actions are normal but could also be part of an attacker's lateral movement.\n\nThe process accesses and file creations by powershell.exe, along with the repeated RegistryEvents across various processes, raise some flags. The combination of multiple PowerShell executions downloading files from GitHub and manipulating system components suggests potential malicious behavior. This batch shows a pattern that could indicate an attack chain, such as initial access, data gathering, or lateral movement.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the activities seem to form a narrative where an attacker is attempting unauthorized actions on the system, making this batch of logs quite interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that download files from external repositories and create or access files in sensitive locations.

Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's any pattern or signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about 'calc.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. That seems normal since those are standard Windows processes. The next few events involve 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. I know svchost is a legitimate process, often used by services, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an event with 'Calculator.exe' loading the same urlmon.dll. That could be normal if Calculator is running additional components. But multiple instances of processes accessing or modifying the registry might raise some flags. I should keep track of how many times this happens.\n\nI see 'powershell.exe' being accessed and created a few times. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated access without clear reason could indicate something fishy. There are multiple events where powershell is accessed or created, which might suggest it's being used in a loop or script.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I notice some 'cmd.exe' commands that delete scheduled tasks and registry entries. For example, one deletes a task named 'spawn', and another removes a registry entry under HKCU\\Run. This deletion could be an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activities, which is common in attacks.\n\nThere's also a command where SCHTASKS is used with '\/Delete' to remove a task. Scheduled tasks are often used by malware for persistence or to execute malicious code at specific times. Deleting such tasks might indicate an attacker trying to cover their tracks.\n\nAnother event uses REG DELETE to remove entries from the Run key, which is part of Windows startup processes. Malware often adds entries here to ensure it runs on startup, so removing these could be an attempt to uninstall or disable them, possibly by another malicious process.\n\nThere are multiple instances where different processes (cmd.exe, reg.exe) are modifying the registry and deleting tasks. The repetition suggests some automated activity, which might be part of a script designed to remove evidence of prior actions. This kind of behavior is often seen in APTs or sophisticated malware aiming to stay undetected.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple process creations for powershell.exe, deletion of scheduled tasks and registry entries, along with the use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and reg.exe, indicates potential malicious activity. The attackers are likely attempting to remove traces of their previous actions or disable mechanisms that would allow them persistence.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is interesting as it shows signs of possible attack patterns, such as cleanup activities and attempts to modify system configurations for persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations (e.g., powershell.exe) and modifications to the registry and scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as cleanup or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The user provided a batch of system log events and wants to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. They specified that only one classification and justification should be returned.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to understand what's happening. Most events involve powershell.exe, which is commonly used by both legitimate scripts and malicious actors. The tasks include ProcessCreate, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, FileCreate, etc. \n\nI notice multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes, modifies the registry, loads images, creates files, deletes them, and interacts with pipes. These actions on their own aren't suspicious but could indicate malicious activity when combined.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's a PowerShell script being created and then deleted quickly. This might be an attempt to remove evidence or execute malicious code temporarily. Also, the use of temp files is a red flag because attackers often use such locations to hide their activities.\n\nThe events also show powershell.exe accessing various system components like mscoree.dll, which can be part of legitimate operations but can also signal exploit attempts. The repeated ProcessAccess and Registry modifications could indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is spawned with command lines that might obfuscate the actual commands, making it harder to trace. This kind of activity often correlates with APTs or sophisticated malware aiming to stay undetected.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a series of actions that, while not individually malicious, collectively raise red flags.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each line is a JSON object representing some log entry. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **whoami.exe**: This process is typically used to get information about the current user. The command line seems normal, just executing whoami in system32. Not suspicious on its own.\n   \n2. **powershell.exe accessed**: PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but also commonly abused by attackers. Accessing it might be normal, but I'll keep an eye out for other indicators.\n\n3. **Registry value set in powershell**: Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations. This could be a red flag if combined with other actions.\n   \n4. **cmd.exe creation with \/c**: The \/c command suggests that cmd is running a single command and then exiting. The exact command isn't clear from just the process name, but it's worth noting.\n\n5. **Another powershell access**: More evidence of PowerShell being used multiple times.\n\n6-7. **Registry modifications in cmd.exe**: This could be part of script execution or legitimate admin tasks. Again, not sure yet, but something to track.\n\n8. **conhost.exe with registry set**: Conhost is a Windows component, usually not malicious on its own. Registry changes here might not be significant unless combined with others.\n\n9-14. **Multiple powershell accesses and ImageLoad events**: These events show that PowerShell is loading various DLLs. While normal for script execution, the repeated access and image loads could indicate something more.\n   \n15-20. **Provider Lifecycle events in powershell**: This might be part of how PowerShell initializes or terminates. Not immediately suspicious unless there's unusual frequency.\n\n21-23. **Registry modifications by ApplicationFrameHost**: This process is related to Windows Store apps, so it's not unexpected for registry changes here. Unless they're doing something unusual, this may not be a problem.\n\n24-25. **File creation and deletion of a PowerShell script**: Creating a temporary script file and then deleting it could be part of testing script execution or obfuscating malicious code. This is a concerning sign because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting files after execution.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed, registry modifications across different processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe), and notably, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file which could be part of a malicious activity to execute code without leaving traces. The repeated use of PowerShell with various system accesses and file operations suggests potential investigation is needed.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern or timeline in these events. Are they happening within a short period? If so, that might indicate coordinated activities rather than normal usage spread over time.\n\nAdditionally, the deletion of the script file after creation is a strong indicator of possible malicious behavior. Attackers often use such techniques to avoid detection by cleaning up their temporary files.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does seem interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits multiple indicators that may warrant cybersecurity investigation. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Repetitive Use of PowerShell**: The log shows several instances where powershell.exe is accessed and interacts with system resources, which could be indicative of malicious activities given the tool's versatility in scripting and attacks.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Both cmd.exe and conhost.exe are seen modifying registry values, potentially indicating attempts to alter system configurations or persistence mechanisms, common in malware.\n\n3. **Temporary Script File Handling**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file suggest efforts to execute code discreetly, a tactic often employed by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nGiven these factors, the batch is deemed interesting for further investigation due to the combination of suspicious activities involving powerful tools like PowerShell and potential attempts at obfuscation or persistence."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze, and I need to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that Calculator.exe is setting a registry value. That seems normal because many applications do that during installation or configuration. Then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe doing various tasks like creating pipes, accessing processes, and modifying the registry. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention here.\n\nI see several instances where powershell.exe creates pipes (Pipe Created events). This could be part of normal communication between processes, but it's also a common technique in malware to establish IPC channels. The process accesses other processes multiple times—ProcessAccess events. That might indicate some form of inter-process communication or potentially privilege escalation if the accessed processes have higher privileges.\n\nThere are numerous Registry value sets (RegistryEvent) from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so seeing repeated writes could be suspicious. Chrome doing these actions might be legitimate since some extensions or updates modify system settings, but multiple such events need context.\n\nOne event stands out: whoami.exe being executed with a command line that just quotes its path. Whoami is often used to check user privileges and can be part of recon during an attack. The fact that it's called without any arguments might indicate it's part of a script or automated process, possibly trying to gather information.\n\nAnother interesting point is the powershell.exe command line: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This seems like an attempt to delete a file from the TEMP directory. Cleaning up files could be part of an attack to remove evidence or prevent detection.\n\nLooking at the files loaded by powershell.exe, they include MpClient.dll and other system files. Malicious scripts often load legitimate DLLs to avoid suspicion, but it's also possible for these to be part of normal operations. The repeated ImageLoad events from various .NET frameworks might just be standard for Powershell execution.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of using powershell.exe with elevated privileges, modifying registry entries, deleting files in TEMP, and executing whoami could indicate a potential malicious activity. However, without more context like timestamps or additional logs showing unusual patterns over time, it's hard to be certain. The repeated actions might suggest scripting rather than manual execution.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because of the suspicious use of powershell.exe, file deletions, and process access events which are common in attack chains. However, I'm not entirely confident without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including registry modifications, file creation, and deletion attempts, along with the execution of whoami.exe.

Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and for malicious activities like executing scripts or commands that could harm the system. \n\nLooking at the first few events: \n- There's an image load event for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which seems normal.\n- Then a file create event for a temporary .ps1 script in the user's Temp folder. That's concerning because creating a PowerShell script in a temp directory could be part of malicious activity.\n- Next, there's a file delete logged for that same script. So someone or something is deleting it right after creating it, which might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running with command lines that remove files from the TEMP folder. The paths like tarefa_base.zip and others seem arbitrary but could be part of a script trying to clean up evidence. Each removal is logged as a Provider Lifecycle task, which makes me think this might be automated or part of a scheduled process.\n\nThen there are events where chrome.exe is accessing registry values and loading DLLs. That's more normal, but it's worth noting that both Chrome and PowerShell activities are present.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which is usually used to get user information. When combined with other suspicious actions, this could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving conhost.exe and registry modifications, which could indicate process injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of PowerShell to delete files from the TEMP directory, especially with error action suppression (the -ErrorAction Ignore parameter), suggests a possible cleanup routine by malware. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file is another red flag because malicious scripts often do this to avoid detection.\n\nThe variety of file deletions targeting different .zip files and text files in the TEMP folder might indicate that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or prevent analysis tools from accessing those files. The inclusion of whoami.exe adds another layer, possibly for information gathering.\n\nWhile some events could be benign (like legitimate script execution), the combination of multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell, file deletions, and process creations makes this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, repeated removal of files from TEMP, and use of error suppression.

That could be suspicious because scripts are often used in attacks. There's a pattern here with different file names being deleted: unidade_base.txt, registro_auxiliar.txt, etc. This repeated deletion might indicate an attempt to clean up traces or remove evidence.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET components, attackers sometimes use them for obfuscation. The fact that they're being loaded in this context might warrant attention.\n\nI notice a file creation event of __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 followed immediately by its deletion. This seems odd because creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be an attempt to test if scripts are allowed or to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process created, which is commonly used in attacks to check user privileges. The fact that it's run without arguments makes me think it's being used for information gathering.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple FileCreate and RegistrySet events from powershell.exe, which could be part of establishing persistence or modifying system configurations maliciously.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, these activities seem like they could be part of a script trying to delete evidence, test permissions, and possibly set up some form of persistence.

PowerShell can be used maliciously, but just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something's wrong. It's commonly used for legitimate tasks.\n\nThere are also multiple Process Create events for whoami.exe. This tool is typically used to check user permissions, which could be part of normal system checks or maybe even by attackers to gather information. However, without additional context like failed attempts or unusual paths, it's hard to flag this as suspicious.\n\nOne event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems benign, likely related to log shipping or monitoring solutions. The other file creation by powershell.exe on pacote_ativo.txt might be part of data processing but again isn't inherently malicious without more context.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and frequencies, there's repetition in the events. The number of process creations and accesses doesn't cross my threshold for concern yet. If these were spread out over time or had anomalies like unusual times, it would raise a flag.\n\nI don't see any failed logins, writes to sensitive files, or other indicators that would suggest malicious activity. All file paths seem standard, especially the use of Downloads and system32 directories.\n\nGiven all this, the events look like normal user activities without signs of compromise.
