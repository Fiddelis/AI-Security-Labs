Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes these kinds of calls frequently. Nothing suspicious there on its own.\n\nThen, I notice several powershell.exe entries. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so it's something to pay attention to. The process accesses, creates new processes, and interacts with the registry—these actions could be part of legitimate admin tasks or malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple Registry value set events from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use the registry for persistence mechanisms. Also, I see file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The files being created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by leaving fewer traces behind.\n\nThe command line details caught my eye. There's a Base64 encoded string used in the PowerShell command. When decoded, it shows XOR encryption between plaintext and a keyword. This is likely obfuscating data meant for exfiltration or communication with a server. The POST request to example.com suggests they're sending encrypted data over the network, which could be part of a C2 (Command and Control) channel.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious activity, registry modifications, file operations in Temp, and obfuscated network communications. These behaviors aren't typical for regular user activities and align with common attack patterns like lateral movement, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence.\n\nI'm confident that this batch indicates malicious behavior. The combination of process creation, registry changes, file manipulation, and encrypted network traffic is a strong indicator of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including suspicious command-line arguments with XOR encryption and network communication attempts.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with the same command line across several entries. The command involves encrypting plaintext data using a simple XOR cipher and sending it via HTTP POST to example.com. This behavior stands out because it looks like an attempt to exfiltrate data, which could be malicious.\n\nNotably, all these events have similar command lines, suggesting repeated attempts or part of a script. That repetition increases suspicion as legitimate scripts rarely do exactly the same thing repeatedly without variation.\n\nLooking at the Windows log (winlog) fields, most tasks are 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These are common system events and usually not suspicious on their own. However, combined with the PowerShell commands, they might indicate an attempt to load components or modules as part of a malicious process.\n\nThere's also an event where a file path is logged: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. This seems like it could be from the winlogbeat.exe, which might be legitimate, but if this tool was compromised or misconfigured, it could be part of an attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, some events show files being loaded by powershell.exe, like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these are standard system files, the context in which they're loaded alongside the XOR encryption script could be concerning.\n\nThe fact that all these events are clustered together and involve data encoding\/exfiltration makes me think this could be part of a data theft or command-and-control communication attempt. The use of a simple cipher might indicate a less sophisticated attacker trying to hide data transfer, but it's still concerning.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'd say there's a high likelihood (around 0.8) that these events are indicative of malicious activity, especially given the repetitive and potentially data-exfiltrating PowerShell commands.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\n\n- **Repetitive Malicious Activity:** Multiple events show identical PowerShell command-line executions, indicating potential repeated attempts or script-based behavior aimed at data exfiltration.\n  \n- **Suspicious Data Handling:** The script uses an XOR cipher to encrypt and send plaintext data to example.com, a red flag for possible malicious activity.\n\n- **Windows Log Context:** While the log tasks are standard system events, their association with the PowerShell commands raises suspicion of component loading for malicious purposes.\n\n- **File Operations:** A file path from winlogbeat.exe and loaded system files could be part of legitimate operations but merit scrutiny given the surrounding context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch exhibits high suspicious activity, particularly due to repetitive malicious scripts and data exfiltration attempts. There's a strong likelihood of malicious intent, warranting further investigation.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 0.8 (High)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{High}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually to see what's happening. Each line represents an event with three keys: process, winlog, and file. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Process is powershell.exe, task is FileCreate. It created a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory.\n2. **Event 2**: Again powershell.exe setting a registry value.\n3. **Event 3**: conhost.exe also setting a registry value.\n4. **Event 4**: Dns query from RuntimeBroker.exe.\n5. **Event 5**: RuntimeBroker.exe again, setting a registry value.\n6. **Event 6**: Powershell.exe setting another registry value.\n7. **Event 7**: Powershell.exe accessing a process.\n8. **Event 8**: Notepad.exe setting a registry value.\n9. **Event 9**: Powershell.exe accessing another process.\n10. **Event 10**: Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a known DLL for URL handling.\n11. **Event 11**: Svchost.exe setting a registry value.\n12. **Event 12**: Another svchost.exe registry set.\n13. **Event 13**: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again.\n14. **Event 14**: winlogbeat.exe creating a file, probably part of log shipping.\n15. **Events 15-18**: More svchost.exe and other processes setting registry values.\n16. **Event 19**: ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry value.\n17. **Event 20**: Calculator.exe again setting a registry value.\n18. **Events 21-30**: Multiple events from chrome.exe, mostly setting registry values and loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll.\n\nNow, thinking about what's normal: Powershell is often used for scripting and can be benign or malicious. Registry writes are common during installations or configuration changes but can also be signs of malicious activity. Conhost.exe is related to console windows and is usually legitimate. RuntimeBroker.exe handles runtime events in Windows, so that seems okay.\n\nDns queries are normal, especially from services like RuntimeBroker. Notepad.exe is a standard app; writing to the registry could be for configuration settings.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll: URLMON.DLL is part of the Windows URL handling, so it's legitimate when applications need to handle URLs or network requests. The Calculator using this might not be suspicious on its own but could be if combined with other events.\n\nSvchost.exe is a common process for services; multiple registry writes here aren't necessarily bad unless they're in unusual locations or quantities.\n\nwinlogbeat.exe seems related to log management, so creating files is normal.\n\nNow, the large number of chrome.exe events: Chrome often writes to the registry during updates or configuration changes. The ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are also standard as these are part of Microsoft's antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events don't stand out as malicious on their own. Powershell being used with registry writes could be concerning, but without additional context like known bad patterns or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The same goes for the repeated registry writes from various processes—could be legitimate updates or configurations.\n\nHowever, the frequency of events might raise an eyebrow. So many registry writes and ImageLoad events in a short period could indicate something is off, but again, without more context, it's not clear. Also, considering that some of these processes are legitimate and commonly perform such actions, there's a high chance this is just normal system behavior.\n\nTherefore, while I can't rule out any possibility definitively without more data, the events as presented don't collectively point to malicious activity. They could be part of system updates, application installations, or regular operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"not_interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events consist primarily of normal system activities such as process execution, registry modifications, and file operations that are typical for applications like PowerShell, Chrome, and Windows services. There is no evidence of unusual patterns or indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessing various resources. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're part of a script or command that's deleting files.\n\nLooking closer, several events show commands using Remove-Item to delete specific batch files. These paths like \"C:\\componente_ativo...\" seem arbitrary and could be attempting to remove malicious scripts. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests the attacker is trying to delete without user intervention or logging, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value set events from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome might interact with the registry normally, the frequency here seems high and possibly unrelated to typical browsing activities. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be part of an attempt to modify system configurations for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion events by PowerShell. Creating a temporary .ps1 script and then deleting it immediately (as seen in FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected) might be an evasion technique, preventing analysis by removing evidence quickly.\n\nThe ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs from different paths also catch my eye. Some of these are normal for PowerShell's operation, but others could indicate the execution of malicious code or lateral movement within the system.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of unusual activity involving PowerShell script deletions and registry modifications. These actions don't seem to align with typical user behavior and could be indicative of a cyberattack attempting to remove traces of malware or establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and deleting files, along with registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity such as script execution and file deletion attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The logs are in JSONL format, and each line is an individual event.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute various commands. Some of these instances have command lines with Remove-Item, which deletes files. This could be a sign of malicious activity, like deleting evidence or attempting to remove traces of an attack.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple calls to cmd.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami is often used to check the current user context, which attackers might use to escalate privileges or gather information. The use of sc.exe with commands like stop and delete on service names seems suspicious too; it could indicate attempts to disable services or remove them as part of a cleanup process.\n\nI also see events where Registry values are being set or modified, involving processes like conhost.exe and services.exe. These activities can be indicative of malicious software trying to maintain persistence in the system by altering registry settings.\n\nAnother point is that some powershell.exe instances don't have associated files, which might mean they're running scripts without saving them temporarily—another tactic to avoid detection.\n\nWhile individual actions could be benign, the combination of multiple suspicious activities raises concern.

My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows cmd.exe being used with a command line that deletes a file in the temp directory. That might be suspicious because deleting files can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially if it's done quietly using >nul to suppress output.\n\n2. Next is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and can execute commands remotely, so repeated access could be a red flag.\n\n3. Another cmd.exe event sets a registry value. Registry modifications are common in malware for persistence or configuration changes, which makes this event notable.\n\n4. This repeats the previous cmd.exe action, setting another registry value. Multiple such events without clear justification might indicate something is amiss.\n\n5. conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is typically used by Windows to host console windows, but it's sometimes exploited by malware. Registry access here could be malicious.\n\n6. Powershell.exe accessed again. This repetition suggests possible script execution or attempts to bypass restrictions.\n\n7. whoami.exe is run without arguments. While not inherently malicious, using it in certain contexts can help gather system information, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\n8. More powershell.exe accesses and registry modifications follow, which together with the previous events show a pattern of repeated PowerShell usage alongside other potentially suspicious activities.\n\n9. Powershell creates a file in the user's temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1. The naming suggests it might be testing script policy, but the creation and subsequent deletion could indicate an attempt to execute untrusted code or test system boundaries.\n\n10. Powershell deletes the same file created in the previous step. Deleting logs or evidence is a common tactic for attackers to cover their tracks, which makes this event more concerning.\n\n11. winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs, but its presence here could be normal unless it's behaving abnormally, which isn't evident from this single event.\n\n12. Multiple events follow with powershell.exe and provider lifecycle tasks, possibly indicating script execution or module loading. The repetition of 'powershell.exe & {}' in the command line is unusual and might suggest an attempt to execute arbitrary code without logging, a common evasion technique.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags:\n- Repeated use of cmd.exe for deleting files and modifying the registry.\n- Multiple accesses to powershell.exe with varied activities.\n- Creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file in the temp directory, which could be part of testing or executing malicious scripts.\n- Use of whoami.exe and conhost.exe in ways that don't align with standard operations.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated attempts to use PowerShell, along with evidence of file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, point towards possible attack vectors such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or system information gathering. Additionally, the deletion of a created file might be an attempt to remove traces, which is a common indicator of compromise.\n\nTherefore, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the cumulative pattern raises concerns about potential cybersecurity threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key points of interest include:\n\n1. **cmd.exe Activities**: Multiple instances of cmd.exe deleting files and modifying registry values suggest possible efforts to remove traces or establish persistence.\n\n2. **Powershell.exe Usage**: Frequent access to PowerShell, combined with the creation and deletion of a script file in the temp directory, raises suspicions of script execution for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Conhost.exe and whoami.exe**: Their use alongside registry modifications and other activities could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n4. **File and Registry Manipulations**: These actions are often employed by malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in PowerShell might be part of script execution attempts, possibly evading standard logging mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**: The cumulative evidence points towards potential malicious activity. The combination of file operations, registry modifications, and suspicious PowerShell usage suggests a possible attack vector, including script execution or persistence mechanisms. Further investigation is warranted to assess the severity and mitigate risks."}

Both are commonly used by attackers because they offer scriptable execution and can be misused for malicious purposes. The repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines that delete files or access the registry is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. Multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating files in various directories, including the StartupProfileData and Downloads folder. Creating files in non-standard locations can be part of establishing persistence.\n2. There are several Registry value sets by both PowerShell and cmd.exe. Modifying the registry can allow attackers to create persistent keys for malicious activities.\n3. The command lines show deletion of temporary files like \"modulo_base.exe\" using cmd.exe, which might indicate an attempt to remove traces or evidence of previous actions.\n4. Powershell commands are being executed with specific syntax, such as \"& {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\", which deletes a log file silently. This is concerning because it shows efforts to cover tracks by removing logs.\n\nConsidering the frequency and combination of these activities—file creation, registry modification, process access, and file deletion—it suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated attempts to delete files in the TEMP directory could be part of an attempt to remove indicators of compromise.\n\nWhile some of this activity might seem legitimate (e.g., using PowerShell for administrative tasks), the volume and specific actions here lean towards something suspicious. The use of multiple processes (Powershell, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) interacting with system components like the registry and file system points toward a possible attack vector or persistence mechanism.\n\nHowever, without more context on whether this activity is part of normal operations for the user or system, it's hard to be certain.

Let me try to piece together what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. That in itself isn't suspicious, but I notice that some events mention file operations like creating and deleting files in temporary directories. For example, there's a file being created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1 and then immediately deleted. That seems odd because why create a script file just to delete it right away? It might be an attempt to test if the system allows certain operations, possibly related to scripting policy.\n\nAlso, there are several events where PowerShell is being called with specific command lines, like \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This command tries to delete a file in the temp directory without showing any errors. Deleting files in the temp directory could be part of a cleanup routine after some malicious activity.\n\nLooking at other events, there are mentions of processes accessing registry values and loading images from known DLLs. Some of these might be legitimate operations by PowerShell or system services, but combined with the file deletions and temporary script creations, it raises flags.\n\nAnother point is that the same command line appears multiple times: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\". Repeating the same command can be a sign of automated or malicious activity trying to cover its tracks by removing logs or files.\n\nI also see that 'whoami.exe' is being executed, which is often used to check user privileges. If this is run in conjunction with other scripts, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system's users or permissions.\n\nConsidering all these events together—creating and deleting temporary files, repeated command executions, registry access, and using whoami—it seems like there could be malicious intent.

PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can do so much, including executing scripts and commands. But just seeing powershell.exe isn't always bad—it could be legitimate too, like system admins using it.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged: there are Image loaded events, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. Some of these actions are normal for powershell.exe to perform, especially when dealing with scripts or configuration changes.\n\nI see that a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1 was created and then deleted quickly.

But sometimes, PowerShell scripts do this for testing purposes.\n\nThere are multiple events where the command line is just 'powershell.exe & {}'. Not sure what that does exactly, but it seems like it's being called without any arguments, which might not be common.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe also caught my eye. It's a utility to get user information, so if an attacker is trying to gather info about the system, they might use this. But again, legitimate processes can execute it too.\n\nLooking at other files mentioned: MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are from Windows Defender, which suggests that maybe powershell.exe is interacting with antivirus components. That could be normal admin activity or perhaps attempts to disable them.\n\nThe events also show process accesses and creations of other processes like winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat sounds familiar—it's likely part of an ELK stack for log management, so this might be a legitimate process gathering logs.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with various tasks, including creating\/deleting files in temp directories, accessing other processes, and launching whoami.exe. These actions could indicate script execution or lateral movement. The repeated use of powershell.exe might suggest something is off, especially since some commands don't seem standard.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because while each event on its own might not be malicious, the combination—especially the temp file creation\/deletion and process interactions—raises flags.

PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The events show that powershell.exe is being accessed and in one case, a registry value is set. Registry modifications with powershell could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, these events are happening within a short timeframe, which might indicate an automated script or batch process.
