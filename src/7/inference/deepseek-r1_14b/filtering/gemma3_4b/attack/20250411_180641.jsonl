{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first four events are all from chrome.exe with network connections detected. That seems normal because Chrome often connects to the internet. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe accessing something, which caught my attention. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things, so I need to look closer. Then whoami.exe runs, but that's usually just checking user information, not malicious on its own.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event follows, and then one where it writes to the registry. That might be a red flag because writing to the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen cmd.exe is called with a command line that includes compiling C# code into an executable. The path in the command line looks suspicious—using hardcoded paths and outputting to a temp directory. This could indicate malicious activity, like creating a new binary on the fly.\n\nThere's another csc.exe process creating files in the Temp folder. Compiling code multiple times might be part of building malicious tools or payloads.\n\nLooking further, several processes are loading images from the system32 and Microsoft.NET directories. Those are legitimate locations, but if they're being loaded by suspicious processes, it could mean something's wrong.\n\nMultiple registry writes by different processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, etc., might be part of setting up persistence or altering system configurations to hide malicious activities.\n\nSome of the process names have long paths with random-looking filenames, like \"modulo_secundario\" and \"estrutura_temporario.\" These could be indicators of custom tools or malware components.\n\nThe events show a lot of process creations and file operations in temporary directories. This activity is common during attacks to create droppers or payloads that execute malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows several red flags—PowerShell usage with registry access, cmd.exe compiling C# into executables, multiple suspicious processes creating files, and repeated registry writes. These behaviors are often associated with cyberattacks, such as lateral movement, payload deployment, or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations, network connections, and file operations that could indicate potential malicious activities such as payload compilation and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of events where 'calc.exe' loads the urlmon.dll file. That seems normal because calc.exe might be using some system libraries for certain functions. But I should keep an eye on that since malicious processes often use legitimate DLLs.\n\nThen, multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a known process that runs many services, so it's common to see it accessing the registry. However, if these accesses are unusual in frequency or location, they could be suspicious. But right now, without more context, I can't say for sure.\n\nThere's an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value too. Again, this is a standard Windows process, so that might not be concerning on its own.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe also sets a registry value. That seems odd because the calculator app doesn't typically interact with the registry in real-time. Maybe it's trying to modify some settings or persistence mechanism? This could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe accessing the registry and another process called 'ProcessAccess'. Powershell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. Seeing multiple registry accesses might indicate malicious activity, like setting up persistence points or creating scheduled tasks.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe, it's doing a lot of registry writes. Chrome itself does modify the registry for settings and extensions, but this volume seems high. Also, one event shows 'amsi.dll' being loaded by chrome. AMSI is related to antivirus and anti-malware scanning interfaces. If an attacker loads this, they might be trying to disable or bypass security features.\n\nAnother chrome.exe event loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate action, as defender uses such DLLs for operations. But combined with other actions, it could still be part of malicious behavior.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool; if it's creating files, that might not be suspicious unless there's unusual naming or permissions on the file.\n\nPutting this all together: The high number of registry writes by non-standard processes like Calculator.exe and powershell.exe raises concern. The involvement of DLLs related to security (amsi.dll) could indicate an attempt to disrupt security mechanisms. There's a pattern where multiple processes are modifying the registry in ways that don't align with their normal operations, which might be part of a larger attack strategy.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including unusual registry modifications by Calculator.exe and powershell.exe, and loading of security-related DLLs. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
