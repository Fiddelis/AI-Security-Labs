Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, I notice that the same processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and sc.exe are appearing multiple times. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because it has powerful features. The events show powershell.exe being accessed several times, which in itself isn't necessarily bad, but repeated access might be worth looking into.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command that creates a service with a binPath pointing to a .ps1 script: \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The filename has \"NonExisting\" in it, which is a red flag. If the script doesn't exist, why create a service for it? This could be an attempt to execute malicious code or create persistence.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command creates a service with binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the file name suggests it's non-existent. Creating services with such paths might be an attempt to run scripts that don't exist, possibly as part of a payload delivery or to hide malicious activity.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets by various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and others. Modifying the registry is common for legitimate software installation, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or change system configurations maliciously.\n\nI also see events where services.exe and svchost.exe are modifying the registry. Svchost.exe is a known process used by various services, including some malware. If these processes are creating or modifying registry entries in unusual ways, it might be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe calc.exe process loading urlmon.dll seems odd. While urlmon is a legitimate Windows DLL for handling URLs, its use with calc.exe doesn't make much sense. This could potentially indicate that an attacker is using a benign-looking process to execute something malicious, like downloading or executing code via the URL handler.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and shouldn't be creating files in user directories unless it's part of a data collection tool, but sometimes attackers use such tools for lateral movement.\n\nAdditionally, multiple processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe are modifying the registry or other system components. While these might have legitimate uses, repeated modifications could signal something is off.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows several indicators that might point to malicious activity:\n- Creation of services with non-existent script paths\n- Multiple registry modifications by various processes\n- Suspicious use of common tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe\n- Loading of urlmon.dll by calc.exe\n\nThese patterns suggest potential malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because while each event could be innocent, the combination of multiple suspicious activities makes it more likely that an attack is occurring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe access and cmd.exe commands attempting to execute non-existent scripts. Additionally, various processes are making registry modifications, which could indicate malicious activity. The use of legitimate tools in suspicious ways suggests potential compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"HIGH\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's take it step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, all are from \"chrome.exe\" with tasks indicating registry value sets. That seems normal because Chrome might be adjusting settings or extensions through the registry. However, seeing multiple such events in a row could be suspicious if they're not part of regular operation.\n\nThen there's an entry where Chrome loads \"amsi.dll\". I know that AMSI is related to anti-malware scanning, so why would Chrome load it? Maybe it's just a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers might try to bypass AMSI. Also, loading \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender could be part of normal operations, but again, multiple such events might warrant closer look.\n\nThe last entry is PowerShell accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers. The fact that it's accessing a process without any file path in the event makes me thinkâ€”could this be something malicious? Maybe trying to get info or modify another process. Since there are multiple Chrome events, and now a PowerShell one, together they might indicate some coordinated activity.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated registry writes by Chrome, loading of system DLLs, and PowerShell process access. These could be signs of potential malicious behavior, like a script or tool trying to hide its actions or perform unauthorized tasks. The combination makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe and process access by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
