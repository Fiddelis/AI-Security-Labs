{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each representing an event. My task is to look at all these events together and decide whether the entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" I need to provide a justification and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event involves `chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll`, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal since Chrome might interact with defender components.\n2. Next, several events from `chrome.exe` show registry value sets and network connections. These could be standard operations for a browser accessing settings or data online.\n3. There's an event where `powershell.exe` creates a file named `objeto_logico.txt`. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious. Creating a file might not be suspicious on its own, but it's worth noting.\n4. Multiple events show `chrome.exe` setting registry values repeatedly. This could indicate normal operation or something more concerning if the activity is excessive or targets sensitive areas.\n5. A DNS query event with no process name might be routine, though without context, it's hard to say.\n6. Another PowerShell event creates `estrutura_ativo.txt`. Again, file creation alone isn't suspicious but part of a pattern.\n7. There are several events where processes like `winlogbeat.exe` and `schtasks.exe` create or delete scheduled tasks. These could be legitimate system operations or potentially malicious if they're attempting to persistence.\n8. The command line for `cmd.exe` shows deletion of specific scheduled tasks, which might indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable monitoring tools.\n9. `svchost.exe`, known for running system services but sometimes used by malware, modifies registry entries. This could be part of a malicious payload setting up persistence.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch:\n\n- The repeated use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with commands like deleting scheduled tasks raises flags. Such activity is often seen in attack chains to remove monitoring tools or create backdoors.\n- The deletion of specific task names (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`, etc.) suggests a targeted approach, possibly to eliminate competition or establish persistence without being detected.\n- Use of schtasks.exe is common for legitimate administration but can also be used maliciously to create or delete tasks remotely.\n- The combination of process creations and deletions alongside file operations could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or deploy malicious payloads.\n\nLooking at the justification points: \n\n1. **Excessive Process Activity**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with potentially destructive commands are red flags, suggesting possible unauthorized access.\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**: Deleting specific tasks might be aimed at removing security tools or creating persistence mechanisms.\n3. **File Creation by PowerShell**: While not inherently malicious, coupled with other activities, it could be part of payload deployment.\n\nConsidering confidence level: The presence of multiple high-risk activities together makes me lean towards this being suspicious. However, without more context (like timestamps, user permissions), some uncertainty remains. But given the pattern of behavior, it's likely indicative of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification**: INTERESTING  \n**Confidence Level**: 85%  \n\nThe batch of events exhibits concerning patterns such as excessive use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for task deletions, which could indicate malicious intent aiming to disrupt monitoring tools. The repeated deletion of scheduled tasks and the use of schtasks.exe further support this suspicion. While not definitive proof of compromise, these activities collectively raise significant red flags.\n\n**Justification**:  \n1. **Malicious Process Activity**: The use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with commands targeting task deletions is indicative of potentially unauthorized system access.\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**: Deleting specific tasks suggests an attempt to remove security tools or establish persistence, common in attack vectors.\n3. **File Operations by PowerShell**: Coupled with other activities, this could be part of deploying malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events strongly suggests potential malicious activity deserving further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events. So, I'm looking at 40 JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a Windows system. My goal is to determine if this batch as a whole is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst off, I notice that many of these events involve common system processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and others. Let's break down what each entry is showing.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n\n1. schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll – that seems normal for scheduled tasks.\n2. svchost.exe modifying the registry – also a standard operation since svchost is part of system services.\n3. cmd.exe and conhost.exe accessing or creating processes, as well as setting registry values – these are typical activities when running commands.\n\nBut then I spot some red flags:\n\n- There's a command in one of the cmd.exe events: `cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1`. WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is often used by attackers for remote control and can be a vector for malicious activities. Deleting processes based on their names might be legitimate, but in this case, it's worth investigating if there's an unauthorized process running.\n\n- Another cmd.exe command: `cmd.exe \/c net user \/del \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\"`. This is attempting to delete a user account named 'tarefa_auxiliar_Admin'. Unusual deletions of accounts, especially ones with '_Admin' in the name, could indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to remove traces of prior activities.\n\n- Similarly, there's `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands deleting users like 'componente_comum_Admin' and 'tarefa_temporario_Admin'. These also seem suspicious. It's unusual for standard operations to involve deleting multiple admin-like accounts unless part of a cleanup routine after malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using WMIC to delete processes and cmd.exe to delete user accounts raises concerns about potential unauthorized access or an attack in progress. The batch shows multiple instances where system tools are being used in ways that go beyond typical user behavior, possibly indicating a breach attempt or post-exploitation activities.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility of these events being part of legitimate system administration tasks. Maybe someone is cleaning up old accounts or managing processes. But given the specific command lines and the variety of tools used (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC), it's hard to dismiss the possibility of malicious intent entirely.\n\nThe high number of process creations and deletions using various methods adds to the suspicion. It's common for attackers to use multiple tools and techniques to cover their tracks or escalate privileges. The repeated attempts to delete specific accounts with admin-like names make me lean towards this batch being indicative of an attack.\n\nTherefore, while I can't be 100% certain without further context, there are enough red flags here to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including process deletions using WMIC and cmd.exe commands attempting to delete user accounts with admin-like names, which may indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is `powershell.exe` with tasks like \"Registry value set\" or \"Process accessed\". PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers because it can do so many things, including executing commands and scripts. The fact that it's being accessed several times might be significant.\n\nLooking closer at some of the command lines, I see `cmd.exe` being used with commands like `\/c net user ... \/del \/domain`. That looks like it's trying to delete a user account across the domain. Deleting users is something that could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack. Similarly, there are entries where `net.exe` and `net1.exe` are deleting other user accounts. This repeated deletion of user accounts is concerning because it suggests someone might be cleaning up traces after unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also a command where `sc delete win32times`, which deletes a service. Deleting services can disrupt normal system operations, and if done without authorization, it could indicate an attacker trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the use of `whoami.exe`. While this is typically used to check user permissions, in some cases, attackers might use it to gather information about the current user context. The fact that it's being executed multiple times might be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n\nThe events where processes like `services.exe` and others modify the registry stand out too. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially when done by unknown or unauthorized processes. These changes could be part of installing malware, modifying system configurations to allow persistence, or covering tracks.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell and command-line tools to delete users, services, and make registry changes suggests a pattern of potentially malicious activity. The volume and nature of these events are beyond normal user behavior, especially in an enterprise environment where deleting domain accounts isn't something that happens frequently unless there's a legitimate reason or an attack.\n\nI'm concerned about the possibility of account deletion being part of an attack to remove traces or disable other users as part of privilege escalation. The combination of multiple process creations and modifications across different tools indicates a possible script or automated tool being used, which is often how attackers operate.\n\nIn summary, these events show signs of potential unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The repeated use of powerful tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe with concerning commands make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletions, service removals, and registry modifications using command-line tools suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. I'm given a batch of system log events and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. The user is expecting just one classification, one justification, and a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually but considering the whole batch together. So, looking at the first few events: cmd.exe deleting files in temp directories. That might be suspicious because deleting files can indicate malicious activity like cleaning traces. But sometimes legitimate processes also delete files, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe entries. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's appearing several times with different tasks—accessed, process create, image loaded—is a red flag. Also, the command lines sometimes have \"& {}\" which might be an attempt to obfuscate or run commands.\n\nI notice some events where powershell is creating files in the temp directory and then deleting them shortly after. This behavior can be indicative of testing permissions or executing malicious scripts that self-delete to avoid detection. The file paths like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1\" seem temporary, which might suggest script execution.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value set events by both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Malware often manipulates the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. This combined with file deletions could be part of a cleanup routine after executing malicious code.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is another point. While it's commonly used to check user permissions, in some cases attackers use it to gather information about the current user, which might precede more malicious actions.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating\/persisting files. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical for standard operations.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe deleting temp files, powershell.exe accessing and modifying system components, creating and then deleting temporary script files, registry modifications—these behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. The volume of suspicious events involving both cmd and powershell, especially the repeated attempts to delete files and manipulate the system, increases my confidence that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n\nI'm not certain it's definitely an attack, but the combination of these activities points towards possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including cmd.exe deleting files, powershell.exe accessing and modifying system components, creating temporary script files that are later deleted, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The keys present in each event seem to be \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and sometimes \"file.\" \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. The first event shows that powershell.exe was executed with some command line arguments. The winlog task is 'Engine Lifecycle.' Not sure what that means, but PowerShell being invoked might be something to look into.\n\n2. The second event also involves powershell.exe, and it's about an image loaded (MpClient.dll). This file path looks like a legitimate Windows Defender file, so maybe this isn't malicious.\n\n3. Next, another powershell.exe event where a file was created in the user's profile directory under PowerShell's StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That seems normal for PowerShell configurations.\n\n4. Then there's an event where conhost.exe is involved, setting a registry value. Conhost.exe is part of Windows and usually used by console applications, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n\n5. A lot of events follow with powershell.exe accessing processes (ProcessAccess rule). This repetition might indicate that PowerShell is being used for some automated task or script, but it's hard to say if it's malicious without more context.\n\n6. There are a few instances where whoami.exe is run. Whoami is a standard tool to get user information, so unless it's part of a larger attack chain, this might not be suspicious.\n\n7. winlogbeat.exe appears multiple times creating files related to its data directory. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper for Windows logs, so if the system has that installed, this is expected behavior and probably not malicious.\n\n8. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also in the logs, doing standard things like loading URLmon.dll (which is a legitimate Windows DLL). So no red flags there.\n\n9. There's an event where RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. Runtime Broker handles user accounts in Windows, so that's normal.\n\n10. Svchost.exe appears several times setting registry values. Svchost.exe is used by various system services, and it's common to see it accessing the registry for configuration purposes.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. There are multiple instances where legitimate tools like PowerShell, whoami, notepad, calc, and svchost are being used as expected. The repetitive ProcessAccess tasks by powershell.exe could be part of a script or tool running in the background, but without evidence of unusual file creations, registry modifications beyond what's normal, or network activity, it doesn't seem concerning.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat suggests that these logs are being collected properly, which is standard for monitoring and not an indicator of compromise itself. The MpClient.dll load by PowerShell seems benign since it's a known Defender file.\n\nIn summary, while there's a lot of activity involving system processes, nothing stands out as unusual or indicative of a security breach. This could just be normal day-to-day operations on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events does not indicate any suspicious or malicious activity. The events involve legitimate processes and tools performing standard tasks. Therefore, this batch is **not interesting** for further investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The logs show normal system activities with legitimate processes like PowerShell, whoami.exe, calc.exe, and notepad.exe performing expected actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe being accessed with the ProcessAccess rule. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note, but I'll need more context. The second event is whoami.exe being executed. That's usually harmless, just checking user information, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access follows, which again makes me think about possible malicious activity since it's a common tool for attackers. Then there are events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing the registry. I'm wondering if these normal system processes writing to the registry could indicate something off, but they might just be part of their standard operations.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe entries, there are multiple DNS queries and network connections detected. While browsing can generate a lot of DNS activity, especially with extensions or scripts, repeated connection attempts could be concerning. But in this case, it's more about the frequency—four NetworkConnect events from Chrome might indicate something like a download or multiple tabs open.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm considering whether these activities collectively suggest malicious behavior. The use of powershell.exe twice is notable because attackers often use it to execute commands. However, without seeing actual command lines or other indicators like file creation\/deletion, it's hard to say definitively. Similarly, the registry access by Calculator and ApplicationFrameHost could be normal, but sometimes adversaries use these processes as part of their attack chain.\n\nThe Chrome activity is a bit concerning because multiple network connections can be signs of data exfiltration or communication with external servers. If these were from unknown domains or showed irregular patterns, it would raise more flags. But without that context, I'm not sure if they're malicious.\n\nI also notice there are no file operations mentioned beyond \"None,\" so maybe the processes aren't creating or modifying files. That could mean it's just process activity without persistence mechanisms. However, the combination of powershell.exe accesses and Chrome connections might still be worth investigating further to rule out potential threats.\n\nIn conclusion, while each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the overall pattern—especially the repeated use of powershell and multiple network connections from Chrome—does warrant some attention. I'm not fully certain it's malicious, but there are enough red flags to consider this batch interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and suspicious network activity from chrome.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
