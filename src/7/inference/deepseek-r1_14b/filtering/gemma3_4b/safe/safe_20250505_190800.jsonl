{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze a batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably normal since it's an agent that collects logs. Next, mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE are setting registry values—common activities during system operations, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I see multiple powershell.exe entries. The command line for one of them includes \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" which stands out because that flag allows running scripts that would otherwise be blocked. Using this could indicate an attempt to execute untrusted code. Also, the process is creating a new file (teste.ps1) in the Downloads folder, which might not be the usual place for script execution.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. While some of these are legitimate .NET and Windows components, others like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Microsoft Defender could be part of normal operation, but combined with other actions, they might suggest something malicious is being loaded.\n\nLooking at the file operations: powershell.exe creates a script file, runs it after changing execution policy, which could be risky. Also, deleting that temporary PowerShell script file after creation (as seen in one event) might be an attempt to cover tracks. Pipe Creation and Engine Lifecycle events are normal for PowerShell but could be part of communication with other processes.\n\nConsidering all these together—the use of Bypass Execution Policy, the creation and deletion of a script file, multiple registry changes—this batch seems indicative of potentially malicious activity. There's a pattern suggesting someone is trying to execute scripts without proper permission, which could be an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including execution policy bypass and file operations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

They're all JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe accessing processes and loading images. Specifically, it's loading various DLL files from Windows directories like System32 and the .NET Framework. That seems normal because PowerShell often loads these libraries when running scripts or commands.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temporary directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1\". Creating temp files isn't unusual, especially for scripts that might need to be executed quickly and then deleted. But I notice that immediately after creating this file, it gets deleted. That's interesting because malicious actors sometimes create temporary files to execute code before deleting them to avoid detection.\n\nNext, another file is created in the AppData Local directory related to PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This might be part of normal PowerShell operations when setting up user profiles or configurations. The fact that it's non-interactive could mean it's part of a background process.\n\nThere are also registry value sets and an event for executing a remote command. These activities can be common in legitimate scripts, but they can also be red flags if they occur without proper context. Executing remote commands might indicate something like a scheduled task or remote execution, which could be malicious depending on the source.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm noticing several behaviors that could be concerning. The creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell script files are especially notable because they mimic common tactics used in attacks—like creating scripts to perform actions before deleting evidence. Additionally, the remote command execution might suggest an attempt to run code from a distant location, which is often seen in attack vectors.\n\nHowever, these actions alone don't necessarily confirm malicious intent. They could be part of legitimate script executions or automated processes. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell and file handling raises red flags. Since PowerShell is a powerful tool that can both automate tasks and execute malicious commands, any atypical usage should be monitored closely.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while some events might not be outright malicious on their own, the cumulative effect suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't too high because there's no concrete evidence of harm yet, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various DLLs and creating\/deleting temporary files.
