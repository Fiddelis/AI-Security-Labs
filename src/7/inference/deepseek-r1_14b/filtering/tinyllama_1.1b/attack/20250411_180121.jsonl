{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs from what looks like Windows system activity. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening. The first few events are from chrome.exe with tasks related to DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking for browsing.\n\nThen there's a switch to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so I'll need to pay attention here. The first event involving PowerShell shows it accessing a process and loading images like mscoree.dll and others. These seem standard as part of .NET framework components.\n\nNext, there's a file creation in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1\". Creating files in Temp isn't inherently bad, but PowerShell scripts there could be suspicious if they're trying to hide or execute malicious code. Then, this script gets deleted, which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is downloading files from GitHub using WebClient. The URLs point to different repositories and LICENSE.txt files. While downloading files can be part of legitimate operations, the fact that they're all going into the TEMP directory and have varying filenames like \"unidade_ativo.txt\" or \"registro_comum.txt\" raises a red flag. Attackers often use such tactics to drop malicious payloads.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell accessing some DLLs related to Windows Defender, which could be an attempt to evade detection or load malicious components under the guise of legitimate processes. There's also a file created in the StartupProfileData directory, which might be trying to establish persistence by adding items to startup scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry writes from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of setting up persistence mechanisms for malware or changing system configurations maliciously.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files, creating temporary script files that get deleted quickly, and making changes to the system's registry. These behaviors are common in attack chains—like downloading malicious payloads, executing them, and ensuring persistence on the system.\n\nI should also consider confidence level. The events point towards potentially malicious activities but aren't definitive proof. It could be a legitimate admin script doing cleanup or testing, though that seems less likely given the combination of actions. Still, the red flags are strong enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub and creating\/deleting temporary files, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup. Next, notepad.exe modifying the registry—could be suspicious but also might just be a legitimate change. Then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be a vector for malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, I see svchost.exe making registry changes twice. Svchost is often associated with system services, so unexpected registry writes could be red flags. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—it's a standard DLL, so not inherently suspicious.\n\nThen whoami.exe runs without any unusual command line arguments. Powershell again accessing processes—this repetition stands out. There are several cmd.exe instances, one deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Scheduled tasks can be used maliciously to persist after reboot, so this deletion might indicate something was trying to hide or remove itself.\n\nSchtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll—that's normal for scheduling tasks. Another powershell access event, then reg.exe deleting a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for \"pacote_auxiliar\". This is concerning because it looks like an attempt to remove a persistence mechanism. Registry entries in the Run key are often used by malware to start on boot.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry—this is unusual since conhost is typically related to console services but isn't commonly associated with malicious activities. Powershell again, then multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks from powershell instances with \"& {}\". This looks like an attempt to execute code in a way that might bypass some monitoring tools.\n\nFinally, another whoami.exe run and a powershell creating a file, followed by deleting it immediately. The creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 suggests script execution, possibly testing for policy enforcement. Deleting the file afterward could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nPutting this all together: There's a lot of Powershell activity, which is common in attacks for lateral movement and executing commands. The deletion of scheduled tasks and registry entries under Run key suggests potential cleanup after malicious activities. The use of cmd.exe with SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\" might indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the repeated attempts with \"& {}\" in command lines could be indicative of code injection or evasion techniques.\n\nOverall, these events show signs of potentially malicious behavior, including process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and attempts to cover tracks by deleting files and tasks. The combination of multiple suspicious activities across different processes raises concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including Powershell executions, registry modifications, file operations, and attempts to delete scheduled tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. The main elements seem to be process information, Windows log task details, and file data. I'll need to analyze these collectively to see if there's any concerning activity.\n\nStarting with the first few events: There's a lot of activity from `powershell.exe`. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The tasks include things like 'Pipe Created', 'Engine Lifecycle', and 'Image loaded'. These are normal operations, so not inherently suspicious yet.\n\nLooking at specific entries:\n- Some events show `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the data directory with `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. That's likely from the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management. No red flags there.\n  \n- There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` accessing files related to Windows Defender and system32 directories. These could be normal operations or part of malicious activities trying to hide.\n\n- Notably, some events mention registry value sets from both `powershell.exe` and other processes like `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`. Modifying the registry can be a sign of persistent malware, as attackers often set registry keys for persistence.\n\nThere's also an event where a script file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1` is created. Temporary script files can be part of testing or malicious payloads to check if scripts are allowed to run, which could indicate an attempt to bypass restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, there are pipes being created by both `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe`. While Chrome creating a pipe might be legitimate (maybe for extensions or plugins), it's worth noting that attackers sometimes use legitimate processes to hide malicious activities.\n\nI notice multiple entries where the command line is `powershell.exe & {}`, which seems like a way to execute commands in Powershell. This could be part of a script or an attempt to run something without being easily detected by simple monitoring tools.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks from Powershell might indicate that it's starting up or tearing down components, but again, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n- The high frequency of Powershell activity is a red flag. While not all Powershell use is bad, excessive and varied usage can be suspicious.\n- Registry modifications from multiple processes could indicate attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.\n- The creation of temporary script files might suggest testing the environment's security policies or attempting to execute unauthorized code.\n\nHowever, some events are normal, like file creations by `winlogbeat.exe` or legitimate Powershell operations. There's a mix of potentially malicious activities and regular processes, making it hard to conclude without more data.\n\nSo, while I'm cautious about the Powershell activity and registry changes, there's no smoking gun here. It might just be an environment with heavy scripting usage or some automated tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a mix of normal and potentially concerning activities, primarily involving `powershell.exe`. While some actions are typical for legitimate operations, others raise suspicion.\n\n1. **Powershell Activity:** The extensive use of Powershell could be either legitimate scripting or indicative of malicious intent. Activities like creating pipes and temporary script files might suggest an attempt to bypass security measures or test the environment.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:** Multiple processes, including `powershell.exe`, are modifying the registry. While some modifications are normal, others may indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes, which are red flags for potential malware.\n\n3. **File Operations:** The creation of a temporary script file and access to system files could be part of malicious activities aimed at testing defenses or executing unauthorized code.\n\n4. **Other Processes:** Processes like `winlogbeat.exe` and `chrome.exe` show normal behavior but also highlight the need for comprehensive monitoring across all processes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs contain elements that warrant further investigation, particularly regarding Powershell's activity and registry modifications. While not conclusive evidence of malicious intent, these indicators suggest a higher-than-normal risk that could merit deeper analysis to ensure system security."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where the process is powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. \n\nLooking at the first event: it's a Process Create task with powershell.exe executing a command to remove a file from the TEMP directory. The command uses Remove-Item and has ErrorAction set to Ignore, which might be trying to avoid logging errors if the file isn't found.\n\nThe next few events are Registry value sets and Image loads. Powershell often interacts with the registry and loads various DLLs, so these could be normal operations unless they're accessing known malicious paths or values.\n\nThen there's a series of File Create and Delete events for temporary PowerShell script files. Creating and then deleting scripts quickly can be a sign of trying to avoid detection. The file names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 seem unusual, and the fact that they're deleted right after creation is suspicious.\n\nI also see multiple Provider Lifecycle events with powershell.exe commands removing various .zip files from TEMP. This repetitive behavior of deleting files might be part of an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activities.\n\nAnother event involves conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, but it's sometimes used in attacks to host payloads or as a means to bypass certain security features.\n\nThere are also several Engine Lifecycle events and Process Access tasks. These might be related to how powershell.exe is interacting with other processes or components.\n\nConsidering all these together, the consistent use of powershell.exe to delete files from TEMP, especially using specific commands and patterns, raises red flags. The multiple deletions of different files with similar naming conventions suggest a possible script being executed to remove evidence. Additionally, the creation and immediate deletion of PowerShell scripts in the TEMP directory could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code without leaving traces.\n\nWhile not all powershell.exe activities are malicious, the combination here—deleting numerous temporary files, especially with .zip extensions, which might contain executable content, and the use of ErrorAction Ignore to suppress errors—is concerning. It's possible that this activity is part of a cleanup routine after dropping or executing malicious payloads.\n\nI'm also noting the involvement of other processes like conhost.exe, which could be part of a more complex attack chain. The multiple registry accesses and image loads might be attempting to load malicious libraries or modify system configurations.\n\nOverall, while each individual event isn't necessarily indicative of malicious activity on its own, the pattern here—especially the repetitive file deletions from TEMP using powershell.exe—isn't typical for normal user behavior or even regular script executions. This makes me lean towards marking these events as potentially suspicious and worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interest_level\": \"high\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The activities involve multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file deletions, creation of temporary scripts, and interactions with the registry and other processes. These actions could indicate malicious behavior or attempts to hide evidence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes, modifying registry values, and loading various image files. This is common because PowerShell often loads several DLLs when running scripts or commands. The file paths look legitimate—things like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll are standard .NET framework components, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nI notice some file creation events in the Temp directory with filenames ending in .ps1. Specifically, __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1. This seems related to PowerShell script policy testing, which is a normal part of how scripts are executed—they might create temporary files to check policies before executing.\n\nThere are also several Remove-Item commands being run in the command line arguments of powershell.exe. These commands are deleting files in the TEMP directory, like registro_comum.txt and estrutura_padrao.txt. Deleting temp files is a common operation, especially during cleanup processes or script execution. It doesn't immediately look suspicious unless these files were unexpected, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses other processes (ProcessAccess) and sets registry values. Again, this can be part of normal operations for scripts that might need to interact with system configurations or run as a different user.\n\nThen I see multiple Registry value set tasks from chrome.exe. That's unusual because Chrome typically doesn't make many registry changes unless it's updating settings or extensions. However, seeing several such events could indicate something like malicious activity trying to modify system settings persistently, but again, without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe last event is the creation of a whoami.exe process. This is commonly used for debugging or to check user permissions and shouldn't be suspicious on its own unless there's an unusual spike in usage or other indicators.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some actions that might seem out of place at first glance—like multiple registry changes by Chrome or file deletions—it doesn't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The majority of the events are standard PowerShell operations and normal system processes. Without additional context like timestamps indicating rapid succession or unusual file paths, I don't see enough evidence to classify this batch as particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal PowerShell activity such as loading DLLs, registry modifications, and file operations. While some actions like file deletions in the TEMP directory could raise suspicion, they are not indicative of malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. There are two entries here, both related to process activity on the system.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe was accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers for command and control or executing malicious commands. The log indicates a 'ProcessAccess' task, which could mean someone tried to interact with an existing PowerShell process.\n\nThe second event is the creation of whoami.exe. Whoami is a standard Windows utility that displays information about the current user. In this case, it's running without any unusual command-line arguments, as indicated by the command line being simply \"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"\". This doesn't raise immediate red flags since whoami is commonly used for legitimate purposes like checking user credentials.\n\nHowever, considering both events together might be interesting. PowerShell is a common tool in attackers' arsenals, and sometimes malicious activities involve chaining commands or using multiple utilities. If these two processes occurred closely together without a clear benign reason, it could hint at potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts. For example, an attacker might use whoami to check their current privileges before executing more nefarious tasks via PowerShell.\n\nBut looking deeper, both events are standard system actions. There's no evidence of any malicious command-line arguments in either process. The creation of whoami is straightforward, and the PowerShell access doesn't show any signs of being used for malicious purposes here. Without additional context or suspicious behavior, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely malicious.\n\nOn one hand, the combination could be a red flag, suggesting an attacker is probing the system. On the other hand, these could just be normal user activities, especially in an environment where scripts and system commands are frequently run. \n\nGiven that there's no overtly malicious behavior indicated, my confidence level isn't too high. While it's worth keeping an eye on, especially if more events follow, based solely on this batch, the activity doesn't strongly suggest malicious intent.\n\nSo, I'd classify this as interesting but with a moderate confidence. It's not clear-cut, so further investigation might be warranted to ensure there's no hidden malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains two events: one where PowerShell.exe is accessed and another where whoami.exe is created. While both are common system processes, their combination could indicate potential malicious activity such as reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
