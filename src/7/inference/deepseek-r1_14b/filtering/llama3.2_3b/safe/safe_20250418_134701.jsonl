Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nAll the events are JSON objects with similar structures. The \"process\" field shows that the same executable, git.exe, is involved in each case. The \"winlog\" task indicates a file creation event, and the \"file\" path points to various .d.ts files under the node_modules directory for cypress and lodash.\n\nI notice that all these files are part of a Node.js project, specifically within the Cypress testing framework's type definitions for Lodash functions.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation. So, first, I'll look at each event individually.\n\nEach JSON object starts with the process name being \"git.exe\". That makes sense because git is a version control tool commonly used in development environments. The next part is the winlog task, which says \"File created\" under the rule FileCreate. This indicates that a file was created on the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are located under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\". The filenames vary but they're all .d.ts files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are part of the node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages in a Node.js project.\n\nNow, considering that these events are all from the same process (git.exe) and involve creating multiple files in a node_modules folder, it seems like this could be related to installing or updating a package using npm. The fact that they're creating several files in a row suggests that this is part of a larger operation, maybe during a build or install process.\n\nI should consider if these activities are normal. Using git and npm is standard for developers working on projects, especially when dealing with TypeScript and tools like Cypress. There's nothing unusual about creating multiple files in the node_modules directory as part of package installations or updates.\n\nAre there any red flags? Well, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to hide their activity, but in this case, all events are related to a known software development toolchain. The file paths and actions don't indicate anything malicious like privilege escalation or unauthorized access. They look consistent with normal development operations.\n\nHowever, since the same process is creating multiple files quickly, it's possible that an attacker might use this as a smokescreen if they wanted to hide other activities. But based solely on these events, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\nIn terms of justification for classification: The batch involves repeated file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development tasks. There are no signs of unauthorized access or suspicious actions here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't seem interesting from a security standpoint because it's within normal operational behavior for a system where developers are using git and npm packages.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve repeated file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is consistent with typical development activities such as installing or updating packages.

Each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. So, I need to analyze all these events together to determine if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that each event has a similar structure. The \"process\" field consistently shows \"git.exe\", indicating that the Git executable is being used. The \"winlog\" task mentions \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests that files are being created on the system. \n\nThe file paths all point to different \".d.ts\" files located in the \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\" directory. These are TypeScript declaration files for Lodash functions, specifically within the Cypress testing framework's type definitions. Since these are standard files that come with Node.js modules like Lodash and Cypress, their creation is a normal part of the development environment setup.\n\nConsidering all events together, it seems they're all related to the installation or update of the Cypress package in a project using Git for version control. This activity doesn't raise any red flags because installing dependencies is a common occurrence during software development. There's no indication of unauthorized access, suspicious file operations, or any other behavior that would suggest malicious intent.\n\nTherefore, while each event on its own might be worth noting, the combination here doesn't indicate anything unusual or concerning for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple entries show Git creating standard TypeScript files during development setup; no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nAll the events have the same structure: they're JSON objects with a \"process\" field indicating that git.exe is running, a \"winlog\" task saying a file was created, and a \"file\" path pointing to various .d.ts files in a node_modules directory. The paths are all under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp, each corresponding to different functions like reduceRight.d.ts, reject.d.ts, etc.\n\nFirst, I notice that git.exe is involved. Git is commonly used for version control, so this could be related to development activities. But since it's creating files in node_modules, maybe the user is setting up or modifying a project that uses Node.js and npm\/yarn packages. Cypress is a testing framework, so perhaps they're working on an application with automated tests.\n\nThe creation of many .d.ts filesâ€”these are TypeScript declaration files. They provide type information for JavaScript modules. So git.exe might be cloning or updating a repository where these types are being added or modified as part of the build process. It's possible that someone is running npm install or yarn add cypress, which would trigger the installation and creation of these types.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to belong to the lodash fp module, which stands for \"lodash\/fp\". Lodash is a popular utility library in JavaScript, and the fp branch contains functions that are more functional programming oriented. So this could be part of installing or updating lodash's fp package as part of the Cypress setup.\n\nNow, why might these events be interesting? Well, sometimes legitimate activities can mimic malicious behavior. For example, file creation is a common indicator in both benign (like development) and malicious (like dropped files by malware) activities. However, in this case, the context seems entirely within a typical software development environment.\n\nThe fact that all events are from the same process, git.exe, and involve creating multiple files in a predictable directory structure suggests it's part of a normal build or install process. There doesn't seem to be any deviation from expected behavior here.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything unusual about the paths or filenames. The file names are all lowercase with .d.ts extensions, which is standard for TypeScript. The directory path includes \"node_modules\", which again is a common place where packages and their types reside after installation.\n\nAnother angle to think about: could this activity be part of a larger malicious process? For example, sometimes attackers use tools like git for exfiltration or lateral movement. But in this case, the events are solely file creations under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp, which is a standard location for such files. There's no indication of any other activities, like network connections or unusual file accesses, that might raise a red flag.\n\nI should also think about whether the number of files created is abnormal. The user provided 18 events (from reduceRight.d.ts to stubString.d.ts). Lodash fp has many functions, so it's plausible that multiple .d.ts files are being created as part of installing this package. It wouldn't be unusual for a developer to install or update such dependencies.\n\nIn terms of timestamps, if these events occurred over a short period, it might indicate something more suspicious, like a bulk file creation which could be part of an infection process. But without that data, I can only assume they're happening as part of the normal package installation flow.\n\nAnother consideration is the user account running git.exe. If this activity is happening under a legitimate developer account, especially during business hours, it's more likely to be benign. However, if it's occurring under a restricted or service account at odd times, that might warrant further investigation.\n\nAlso, checking for similar events before and after could help determine if this is part of a recurring process, like daily builds or CI\/CD pipelines. If these file creations are consistent with previous patterns, there's less cause for concern.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to analyze each event, the context provided strongly suggests legitimate development activity rather than malicious behavior. The use of git.exe, creation of expected files in node_modules, and the nature of the files themselves all point towards standard software development practices.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is not indicative of suspicious or malicious activity.

This means that the process involved in creating the files is git.exe, which is commonly associated with Git for version control systems.\n\n2. **Winlog Task**: All events have the task set to \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, each of these is a log entry indicating that a file was created.\n\n3. **File Path**: The paths are all similar but end with different .d.ts files.

The .d.ts extension suggests these are TypeScript declaration files, which are often part of type definitions for libraries like lodash in Node.js projects.\n\nConsidering that git.exe is involved, it's likely that this activity relates to someone working with a project using Git, possibly cloning or updating repositories, which would involve creating new files or directories. The fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created sequentially might indicate a build process where TypeScript definitions are generated and saved.\n\nIs this kind of activity unusual? In the context of development work, especially in projects using tools like Cypress for testing and Node.js with TypeScript, it's pretty standard to have such file creation events when dependencies are installed or updated. The node_modules directory is where third-party libraries are stored, including their type definitions.\n\nAre there any red flags here? Not really.

Maybe the user is cloning a repository, initializing a new project, or pulling updates which trigger the creation of these TypeScript declaration files. Alternatively, it could be part of an automated build process that uses Git for version control alongside npm for dependency management.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity here? Not directly. The actions seem consistent with normal development activitiesâ€”installing packages, setting up a project, or updating code. The use of Git is expected in such environments to track changes and manage versions.\n\nI should also consider the frequency of these events. There are 18 entries, each creating a different file under lodash's types directory. That seems like a lot, but if the user is working on a large project with many dependencies, it might make sense. Alternatively, maybe there was a script that generated multiple files at once.\n\nAnother angle: could Git be used in some way to execute malicious scripts? While possible, I don't see any indicators here. The events are straightforward file creations without any signs of suspicious paths or filenames. No exes being executed, no writes to unexpected locations like the system32 directory, which is a common target for malware.\n\nThe path structure looks legitimate. \"node_modules\" is standard in Node.js projects, and Cypress is an established tool. The fact that all files are under \"types\/lodash\/\" further suggests they're part of a library or package being installed.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of these events being part of an automated setup. Maybe after cloning a repository, scripts run to install dependencies, which in turn create these declaration files as part of their build process.\n\nIs there any reason to suspect foul play? Without more context, it's hard to say. But based on the information given, these events align with normal development practices rather than malicious activities. The consistent use of Git and npm packages doesn't raise red flags for me.\n\nSo, putting it all together: a user likely working on a web project using Node.js and TypeScript is setting up their environment. They're using Git to manage their codebase, which could include initializing repositories or pulling updates. As part of this setup, dependencies like Cypress are being installed, leading to the creation of these .d.ts files under node_modules.\n\nI don't see any signs that would classify this as suspicious or indicative of a security threat. It looks more like routine development activities rather than something malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of JSONL events indicates normal development activities without signs of malicious behavior. Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **Process and Task**: All events involve \"git.exe\" creating files, suggesting Git usage for version control in a development environment.\n\n2. **File Creation**: Each event creates a .d.ts file under the node_modules directory, specifically within a Cypress package. These are TypeScript declaration files, common in Node.js projects using TypeScript.\n\n3. **Context**: The activities align with setting up or managing a web project, possibly involving dependency installations via npm and automated scripts during repository setup or updates.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There's no evidence of malicious activity; the events reflect routine development practices rather than suspicious behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment**: This activity is likely part of a legitimate software development process, specifically related to setting up a Node.js project with TypeScript and Cypress for testing, using Git for version control. No signs of cyber threats are present in the provided data."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, the user provided several JSONL entries, each representing a file creation event by git.exe in a specific path.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events are similar: same process name (git.exe), same task type (File created), and the paths are all under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash with different .d.ts files. These seem to be TypeScript definition files for Lodash, which is a common library in Node.js projects.\n\nSince git.exe is typically used for version control, creating these files during a checkout or clone makes sense. It's a standard part of the development workflow when setting up or updating project dependencies. There's nothing unusual here; it's just part of how node_modules are handled after a git operation.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity like file deletions, access to sensitive areas, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks. All the files being created are expected in a typical development environment using tools like Cypress and Lodash.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's likely just normal operation related to software development. So, I'd classify it as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence because these events align with standard user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by git.exe in a typical node_modules directory structure, which is common during development workflows. These are normal and expected log entries.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
