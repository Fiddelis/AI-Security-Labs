Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a few cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes with specific command lines. The cmd.exe commands are creating services using sc create, which is normal administrative activity. However, the paths in the command line, like \"c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\", stand out because they're referencing non-existent scripts. That could be a red flag since malicious actors often use non-existent files to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple sc.exe processes creating and querying services. Creating new services can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, so this is definitely something to look into. The fact that the same service name \"win32times\" is used in both creation and query commands might indicate an attempt to ensure the service is persistent across reboots.\n\nI also see several Registry value sets by processes like services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and others. Frequent writes to the registry could be a sign of malicious activity trying to modify system configurations or create persistence points. These events alone aren't necessarily suspicious, but combined with other actions, they raise concerns.\n\nThere are instances where Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. While this DLL is legitimate, sometimes malware can load it for certain purposes. However, without more context on how it's being used, it's hard to say if this is malicious. Similarly, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll might be part of normal operations since Amsi is related to antivirus scans.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, sc.exe) performing actions that could be part of installing or configuring a service. The repeated Registry writes and the use of non-existent script paths make me lean towards this batch being potentially malicious. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute commands.\n\nI'm assigning a confidence level based on the combination of these events, though individually some could be benign. The repetition and specific file references are concerning enough to classify this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and registry modifications, including attempts to create services with non-existent scripts, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
