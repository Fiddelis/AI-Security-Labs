{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups as part of its operation. Nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nThen I notice several PowerShell processes starting with command lines that have paths like C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat. The use of multiple dots in the path might be an attempt to bypass certain security checks by using relative paths, which can sometimes indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is loading various system DLLs and other files. That's not unusual on its own, but combined with the earlier command lines, it raises a flag. Malware often uses legitimate tools like PowerShell for execution because they're commonly allowed in environments.\n\nThere are file deletion logs from PowerShell as well. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up after malicious activities to avoid detection. The specific path being deleted is temporary and related to script policy testing, which might be an attempt to evade script block policies in certain security setups.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where cmd.exe and conhost.exe are accessing the registry. While these are standard command-line tools, their use alongside PowerShell could indicate a broader script or process execution that's worth looking into.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell instances with potentially malicious command lines, file deletions, and relative path usage suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence is high because these activities are common in attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe processes accessing various system files and registry entries, as well as file deletions and network connections that may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me look at the data provided.\n\nThe event has a process named \"winlogbeat.exe\". I know that Winlogbeat is an agent used by the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect and forward logs, including Windows Event Logs. So it's a legitimate system process.\n\nThe Windows log entry says the task is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". That means something was created on the system. Looking at the file path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. The filename ends with .new, which I've seen before as a common naming convention when files are being updated or replaced.\n\nSince this is part of the Winlogbeat installation or configuration process, it's expected that during setup, new config files might be created. This doesn't seem unusual because software installations often create initial configuration files if they don't exist.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any indication of malicious activity here. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, strange file paths, or unexpected behaviors beyond what Winlogbeat typically does. The event is consistent with normal system operations.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's just a regular part of how the software operates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event involves a legitimate process (winlogbeat.exe) creating a configuration file during its setup or operation, which is expected behavior and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
