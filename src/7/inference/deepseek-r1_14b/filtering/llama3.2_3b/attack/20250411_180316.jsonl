Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first line has RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal since it's part of Windows' user profile services. Next, powershell.exe accessed something. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so that might be a red flag, but I need more context.\n\nThen there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe shouldn't be accessing external DLLs like that. That could indicate tampering or malware. Next, svchost.exe setting a registry value—svchost is a legitimate process, so unless it's doing something unusual, maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nCalculator.exe also loaded urlmon.dll. Hmm, same as calc.exe; this might be another sign of unauthorized activity. Then whoami.exe was run with the command line pointing to system32, which is standard for checking user info, but could be used maliciously too.\n\nI see multiple powershell.exe events—Process accessed and Registry value sets. That's a lot of PowerShell activity without clear justification. Malware often uses PowerShell for execution or persistence. The cmd.exe with a command to delete notepad.exe via wmic process seems suspicious. Deleting processes can be part of hiding traces, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere's another cmd.exe copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That looks like it's restoring system files, but why? Maybe trying to replace legitimate files with malicious ones. Then schtasks.exe was run to delete a task. Deleting scheduled tasks can be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nMultiple registry writes by various processes could indicate configuration changes, possibly setting up persistence or altering security settings. The last events show cmd.exe being used again, possibly for more actions, and conhost.exe also writing to the registry—conhost is usually related to command prompt; unusual activity here might be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of legitimate tools (PowerShell, cmd.exe) being used with potentially malicious commands, processes accessing DLLs they shouldn't, and attempts to modify system files and scheduled tasks. This combination suggests possible malicious activity like persistence, data exfiltration, or covering tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including unusual PowerShell usage, potential file tampering, and attempts to delete system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be a red flag. For example, the first event shows powershell.exe being used, and another shows cmd.exe with a command line that's just \"\/c\" which seems incomplete or possibly obfuscated.\n\nLooking further, there are several registry value set events from both powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity because attackers might try to modify system configurations to maintain persistence or change settings. Also, the fact that powershell.exe is accessing various files like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework components could be part of legitimate operations, but sometimes these are also used in attacks for obfuscation.\n\nThere's a file creation event by powershell.exe: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. This looks suspicious because it's creating a script file in a temporary directory, which is common for malicious scripts to avoid detection or create temporary files during execution.\n\nI also see multiple events where powershell.exe is called with different command lines that involve checking the existence of various batch files. The use of exit codes (0 if path exists, else 1) might be part of a script checking for certain conditions on the system. This could be a way to test whether specific files are present as part of a larger attack sequence.\n\nAdditionally, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe. These can sometimes indicate that Powershell is being used in a more complex manner, possibly loading custom modules or scripts which might not be standard.\n\nThe last few events show powershell.exe being launched with specific command lines that include paths to batch files. The fact that these are different each time suggests some sort of script execution where multiple checks are being made for various files. This could be part of a larger attack pattern, such as testing if certain directories exist before executing more malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell.exe processes with varying command lines, registry modifications, file creation in temporary directories, and repeated attempts to check for specific batch files suggests potentially malicious activity. While some events could be legitimate, the volume and nature of these activities lean towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits characteristics indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Powershell and Cmd Usage**: The frequent use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe is notable, as both tools can be used for malicious purposes.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Events show registry value sets from both powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which could indicate attempts to modify system configurations, a common tactic in attacks for persistence.\n\n3. **File Creation in Temporary Directory**: Powershell created a script file in a temporary directory, which is often used by malware to execute temporary scripts.\n\n4. **Multiple Command Lines with Batch File Checks**: The repeated execution of powershell.exe with different command lines checking for batch files suggests a script testing various conditions, possibly as part of an attack sequence.\n\n5. **Provider and Engine Lifecycle Events**: These events indicate complex Powershell usage, potentially involving custom modules or scripts, which can be suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities, including the creation of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and repeated checks for batch files, suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent. While some actions could be legitimate, the overall pattern strongly indicates potential cybersecurity threats."}

I'm trying to figure out if these logs are interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is the process name. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so this catches my attention. The tasks logged include things like Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. These are common actions, but when they occur repeatedly in a short time frame, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n\n1. There's a file creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1, which is then immediately deleted. This seems unusual because creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n2. Another file created is elemento_padrao.txt. I'm not sure what this means, but the naming doesn't raise immediate red flags on its own.\n3. Several registry value sets are happening from powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities, especially if they're trying to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n4. The command lines show that powershell is being used with specific scripts. For example, one script checks if a .bat file exists and exits if it does, otherwise creates it. This kind of conditional behavior could be trying to ensure a malicious script runs only once or under certain conditions.\n5. Multiple instances where New-Item and Set-Content are called to create new batch files with specific paths and content like \"dir\". Creating scripts in unusual locations might indicate an attempt to drop files that can execute commands, potentially as part of a larger attack.\n\nI also see that chrome.exe is involved in some registry writes, but since it's a legitimate application, unless there's an anomaly in how it's interacting with the registry, this might not be too concerning on its own. However, given the volume of powershell activity, I'm more focused there.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows several indicators that could point to malicious behavior. Powershell is often used for attacks because it has legitimate purposes and can execute code in various ways. The repeated file creations, deletions, and registry modifications could be part of setting up persistence or preparing the system for further actions. The fact that multiple scripts are being created with similar patterns suggests a coordinated effort, possibly an automated attack.\n\nI should also consider if these activities are within normal variance for the user's environment. If this kind of activity isn't typical, then it definitely warrants closer investigation. Without more context, but based on the logs provided, there are enough red flags to suggest potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided log entries, these events exhibit several characteristics that may indicate potentially malicious activity, particularly involving powershell.exe. The repeated creation and deletion of files, conditional script execution, and registry modifications are concerning. These actions could be indicative of an attack aiming to establish persistence or deploy further malicious scripts. Given these indicators, it is advisable to conduct a thorough investigation to assess the potential risks and ensure system security.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the logs contain indicators that may suggest malicious activity and warrant further investigation.}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. I see multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that create and set content in various script files. Some of these scripts are named things like \"tarefa_comum_script.bat\" and \"modulo_base.objeto_padrao_script.bat.\" The fact that the same pattern repeats across different paths suggests a possible automated process or script execution.\n\nLooking at the file operations, there are several instances where new files are being created with commands like Set-Content. These actions might be part of legitimate scripting, but considering the naming conventions and repeated patterns, it's suspicious. The files being created in different directories could indicate an attempt to spread malicious scripts across the system.\n\nAdditionally, I notice events related to file creation, image loading, and process access. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so while not all uses are malicious, the combination here raises concerns. There's also a FileDeleteDetected event, which might indicate an attempt to remove traces of previous actions, a tactic often used in attacks.\n\nThe consistency in command structures and the repeated use of similar filenames across different directories make me think this could be part of a larger campaign or malicious script deployment. These activities don't seem like typical user behavior and might be indicative of lateral movement within a network or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the batch appears to show potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions creating scripts in various directories suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The commands seem to be checking the existence of certain files. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\". This looks like a script that's testing whether a particular file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1 based on the result. These checks are common in scripts to ensure required files are present before proceeding.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is being used, each time with similar command-line structures. The paths mentioned vary but follow a pattern, suggesting they might be part of a larger script or multiple attempts to check different locations. This could indicate some form of file verification process, perhaps during the execution of another program or script.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where whoami.exe is being run. Since whoami is typically used to determine user information, seeing it alongside powershell.exe might be part of an authentication or privilege escalation attempt. However, in this case, it's run without any unusual command-line arguments, so it doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe with a specific command: \"\/c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\\\objeto_logico.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )\". This checks if a file exists in the temp directory and exits accordingly. Again, this seems like part of a script to verify file presence.\n\nLooking at the types of Windows log tasks, there are events related to Process Create, File Created, Image Loaded, and others. The fact that powershell.exe is creating files or accessing processes could be normal if it's part of legitimate operations, but repeated such actions might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThe paths mentioned in the command lines don't seem to align with standard system directories. For example, \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\" is an unusual path structure. This could be a sign of malicious activity trying to access custom or less-known files.\n\nConsidering the frequency of powershell.exe executions and the specific file checks, it's possible that this script is attempting to spread across different directories or check for certain conditions, which might be indicative of malware behavior. Powershell is often used by attackers due to its scripting capabilities and access to system functions.\n\nMoreover, the repeated Process Access events could mean that the script is interacting with other processes, possibly trying to elevate privileges or gather information. While not conclusive on their own, these events in combination with file checks might be part of a larger malicious routine.\n\nHowever, without additional context, such as timestamps indicating rapid succession or unusual access patterns, it's challenging to definitively label this as malicious. It could also be a legitimate script performing necessary checks during system operations.\n\nIn summary, while there are red flags like multiple powershell.exe executions with specific file checks and the use of whoami.exe, these could also fit certain legitimate scenarios. Further investigation would involve looking at the exact timestamps, the source of these scripts, and whether they correlate with known malicious activities or legitimate processes.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Commands:**\n   - Multiple events show powershell.exe being executed with command lines that check file existence using Test-Path. For example:\n     ```\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\n     ```\n   - whoami.exe is also executed, which typically retrieves user information.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The command lines suggest the script is verifying the presence of specific files across different paths.\n   - cmd.exe is used with a similar purpose to check if a file exists in the temp directory.\n\n3. **Examine File Paths and Directories:**\n   - The paths referenced are non-standard, such as \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\".\n   - Unusual file structures may indicate malicious activity attempting to access custom or less-known files.\n\n4. **Consider the Frequency of Events:**\n   - The repeated execution of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with specific checks could signal a script running multiple times, possibly indicating spread across directories or persistence attempts.\n\n5. **Assess Windows Log Tasks:**\n   - Events include Process Create, File Created, Image Loaded, etc.\n   - Powershell's process creation and file operations can be legitimate but also common in attacks for executing malicious scripts.\n\n6. **Evaluate Potential Malicious Indicators (MIs):**\n   - Use of powershell.exe with custom scripts.\n   - Checking for files that don't align with standard system operations.\n   - Multiple attempts to access or create files, which could be part of payload deployment or persistence mechanisms.\n\n7. **Determine the Likelihood of Malware:**\n   - The combination of file checks, process creations, and non-standard paths increases suspicion towards potential malware activity.\n   - Powershell is a common tool for attackers due to its scripting capabilities and system access features.\n\n8. **Consider Legitimate Scenarios:**\n   - It's possible that these are legitimate scripts performing necessary checks during system operations or updates.\n   - Without additional context, such as timestamps indicating rapid succession or known malicious patterns, definitive conclusions are challenging.\n\n9. **Propose Further Investigation Steps:**\n   - Review the exact timestamps to check if events occur in rapid succession.\n   - Investigate the source of these scripts and whether they correlate with known malware signatures.\n   - Look for any associated network activities or other system anomalies that could indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log events contains several red flags, including multiple powershell.exe executions with file checks, non-standard file paths, and whoami.exe usage. While these indicators may suggest potential malicious activity, they could also be part of legitimate operations. Further investigation is necessary to determine the nature of these events by analyzing timestamps, script origins, and correlating with known threats or system behaviors."}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial event shows whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal for user identification, so not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe processes starting up with specific command lines. I notice that the command lines include checks using Test-Path against various file paths. The pattern here is repetitive: each command line is testing if a particular .cs file exists in different directories. This repetition makes me think it's part of a script checking multiple locations for some file.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses and loads images like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate DLLs used by PowerShell, so that doesn't raise a red flag immediately.\n\nThen, I see that powershell.exe creates temporary files in the user's AppData directory. Specifically, it creates and then deletes a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. This seems like part of a script execution process to test policy compliance. However, deleting the file right after could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThere are multiple events with Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle tasks, which again are standard PowerShell operations as it initializes and runs scripts.\n\nThe last few events show file creation in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory, which is normal for user profile data when starting non-interactive sessions.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch involves repeated PowerShell processes checking various files and performing some actions. While some behaviors like creating and deleting temp files might seem suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate script execution or testing. However, the repetitive checks across different file paths and directories don't clearly indicate malicious activity but could be a sign of a script probing for certain files as part of its operation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because while there are some atypical actions like temp file creation\/deletion, they fit patterns seen in legitimate PowerShell usage. The confidence is medium because without more context or additional indicators of compromise, it's hard to definitively rule out malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe processes performing file checks and operations that appear to be part of legitimate script execution.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific PowerShell scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1). This looks suspicious because such scripts often have malicious purposes, like keylogging. The fact that it's checking different paths suggests it might be trying to locate a script to execute.\n\nThen, there are several events where powershell.exe is being accessed or its images are being loaded. That could mean the process is initializing or running some modules, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with the earlier checks, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe is being run a few times. While this command can be innocent (used to check user permissions), in the context of other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system, possibly for later malicious use.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file creation event for a temporary PowerShell script. This could be part of testing whether the script is allowed or to execute it, which is concerning as it might be trying to run unauthorized code.\n\nThe process create and access events, along with the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across various paths, make me think that an attacker is trying to establish persistence or execute malicious scripts. The use of multiple paths could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by checking different locations where the script might be stored.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of behavior that suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines and file creation events are red flags.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That catches my eye because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's appearing multiple times with different log entries makes me think there might be something significant here.\n\nLooking at the events, I see several instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes, modifying registry values, and creating files. For example:\n- There are 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks. Malware often uses these to maintain persistence or modify system configurations.\n- One event shows a file being created in the user's Downloads folder named 'estrutura_secundario.txt'. While not immediately suspicious on its own, combined with other activities, it raises questions about what this file contains.\n\nAdditionally, there are network connection detections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. Svchost is another common process that can be legitimate or part of malware, especially if it's making unexpected connections. Chrome might have a plugin or extension acting up, but combined with other events, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe command line in some powershell.exe events includes 'ls -recurse' and similar commands, which are often used for directory traversal. This could indicate data collection or lateral movement within the network, which is a red flag for potential exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nI also notice repeated log entries from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. While this might be part of normal log shipping processes, it's worth checking if this is expected behavior in the environment to rule out any anomalies.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple indicators that point towards potentially malicious activities: unusual powershell commands, file and registry modifications, network connections, and repeated events from known suspects like svchost and powershell. These factors combined increase the likelihood of something being amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious activities such as registry modifications and file creation, combined with network connection attempts from other processes, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
