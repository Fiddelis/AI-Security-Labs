{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some system activity. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event involves RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Runtime Broker is a legitimate Windows process used for managing runtime permissions.\n\n2. Next up is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. I'll keep an eye out for more events involving PowerShell.\n\n3. Then there's svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost.exe is another common system process, often associated with services. Malware sometimes hides under svchost, but it's also normal activity, so not immediately suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\n4. Another svchost.exe event doing the same thing as above. Repetition of this might be worth noting if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\n5. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator is a simple app and shouldn't need to load URL-related DLLs unless maybe for some malicious code injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\n6. winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool for log management, so this is likely legitimate unless it's doing something unusual with logs.\n\n7. whoami.exe being run from the command line. This is a common info-gathering tool used by both admins and attackers to check permissions, so context is needed here.\n\n8. Another PowerShell access event. Now we've seen two in a row; maybe this is part of an attack chain, like downloading scripts or executing commands.\n\n9. ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values. This is another legitimate Windows process related to the Start Menu and apps. Unusual if it's modifying registry keys in a malicious way, but common otherwise.\n\n10. Calculator.exe again, setting a registry value. Combining this with the previous Calculator event loading urlmon.dll might indicate something suspicious, like persistence or altering system settings without reason.\n\n11. PowerShell setting a registry value again—fourth time now. This repetition is concerning. Attackers often use multiple registry modifications to set up persistence mechanisms or disable security features.\n\n12. cmd.exe with a command line: \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Oh, this stands out. WMIC is a powerful tool that can be used for remote commands and can execute malicious scripts. Deleting Notepad.exe processes might be part of an attack to cover tracks or prevent analysis.\n\n13. Another cmd.exe event setting registry values. Now we have multiple instances where command-line tools are being used, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\n14. WMIC.exe running a delete command on notepad.exe. This is similar to the previous cmd.exe event and suggests potential malicious activity using legitimate tools for destruction or persistence.\n\n15. WMIC.exe loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Loading these DLLs could be trying to bypass certain security measures, like AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), which detects malicious activities. If it's attempting to load AMSI, maybe it's trying to disable it.\n\n16. WMIC.exe loading another DLL related to Windows Defender. This might indicate an attempt to interfere with antivirus or endpoint protection, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\n17. cmd.exe setting registry values again, adding to the list of concerning command-line activities.\n\n18. conhost.exe setting registry values. Conhost is often used in Windows for console applications, but again, if it's modifying system settings, it could be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at all these events together, there are multiple instances where legitimate tools like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and WMIC are being used with potentially malicious commands. The repeated use of these tools and the specific actions taken (like deleting processes, setting registry values) could indicate a coordinated attack attempting to establish persistence, disable security features, or cover their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, the loading of DLLs by these processes is concerning because it can be used for code injection or bypassing security mechanisms. The combination of multiple such events across different processes makes me lean towards this being an interesting batch from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Legitimate Processes:** Recognize that tools like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe are legitimate but can be used maliciously.\n\n2. **Spot Repetitive Activities:** Notice multiple events where these tools are used, which may indicate a pattern of suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:** Look for commands that could be part of an attack chain, such as deleting processes or modifying system configurations.\n\n4. **Check DLL Loadings:** Determine if loaded DLLs might interfere with security features (e.g., AMSI) or execute malicious code.\n\n5. **Assess Combined Activity:** Consider the overall context when multiple suspicious events occur together, suggesting a coordinated attack.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events is determined to be **interesting from a cybersecurity perspective**, indicating potential malicious activity using legitimate tools for potentially harmful purposes."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL lines, each representing an event with process info, windows log tasks, and sometimes file details.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each event quickly. Most of them are processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, conhost.exe, schtasks.exe, and svchost.exe. The tasks in the winlog field include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, Image loaded, etc.\n\nLooking for red flags: Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful. I see multiple powershell.exe processes accessing or creating stuff. For example, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and setting registry values. That could be suspicious because attackers might use these actions to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nAnother thing is cmd.exe being used with commands like copy and schtasks. The command \"\/c schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\" stands out—it's deleting a scheduled task. If this task was created by an attacker, deleting it could be trying to cover tracks. There's also a command that copies files between system32 directories, which might be replacing legitimate files with malicious ones.\n\nThere are several instances of processes being created and accessing the registry. Registry modifications can be indicators of malicious activity because attackers often set or delete registry keys for persistence or to change system behavior.\n\nI also notice whoami.exe being run multiple times. While this is a legitimate tool to check user permissions, in certain contexts, it might be used by attackers to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking at the file field, most events don't have files involved except a few where chrome.exe loads some Defender-related DLL and schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. Those seem normal unless there's something wrong with those files, but I can't tell from this data alone.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple powershell processes doing registry writes and process accesses, cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks, and other potentially suspicious actions. These could be signs of an attack or unauthorized activity. However, some of these actions might also be legitimate user activities, especially with common tools like powershell and cmd being used.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because there are several red flags, but I'm not 100% certain without more context. Maybe the frequency of these events is high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated use of PowerShell for registry modifications and process access, deletion of scheduled tasks using cmd.exe, and other potentially malicious actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and whoami.exe are accessing or creating registry values. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often use them to persistence. However, legitimate software also does this during installation or configuration, so it's not immediately concerning unless the same process is doing multiple writes.\n\nLooking at the events involving powershell.exe, I see multiple instances of \"Registry value set,\" which is definitely something to watch for. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The repeated access to registry values might indicate some script running in loops or trying different methods to maintain persistence.\n\nThere are also several events where powershell.exe is creating files, specifically a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Creating temp files isn't inherently bad, but the naming suggests it's related to script testing or policy evaluation. The fact that this file was created and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to avoid detection. Additionally, the paths involved are in user directories, which is common for scripts but might indicate activity specific to that user.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Process Create\" events from powershell.exe with varying command lines. Some have \"& {}\" which is a way to execute another script or command, possibly indicating chaining of commands. The last event shows a process starting with a YAML file path, which could be related to configuration files but might also hint at some tooling being used, like Winlogbeat.\n\nI'm also noticing multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks for powershell.exe. These events are normal when PowerShell starts up or modules load, but combined with the other activities, it might indicate that PowerShell is being actively used in a way that's worth monitoring.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of repeated registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and multiple process creations from powershell.exe suggests potential malicious activity. While individual events could be benign, the volume and pattern over time are concerning. Therefore, I classify this batch as interesting with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values, creating temporary files, and repeated process creations.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. All the entries are in JSONL format with each line being a separate event.\n\nI notice that most of the events involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for malicious purposes like command execution and script downloading.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are ImageLoad, FileCreate, ProcessAccess, and RegistryEvent. Some commands check if certain files exist and exit based on that. These checks could indicate file presence verification before executing something else.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry access. Malware often modifies the Windows registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThe repeated use of 'powershell.exe' with specific command lines suggests scripting, which might be part of an automated process or malicious activity trying to stay undetected.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are signs that could indicate malicious behavior such as file checks and registry modifications. However, without seeing actual malicious commands or known bad indicators in the script paths, it's hard to be certain.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive evidence of an attack, the pattern is concerning enough to merit closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe with command lines checking for file existence, which could indicate malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few entries involve powershell.exe performing actions like file deletions and creations. Specifically, there's a File Delete event on a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which might be suspicious because attackers often delete their traces. Then, another file creation in the Downloads folder—could that be part of malicious activity?\n\nLooking further, I see multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe. Nine times, chrome is modifying the registry. That's unusual for Chrome; it typically doesn't make such changes unless there's some extension or script running with elevated privileges.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Pipes are often used in inter-process communication, but in malicious contexts, they can be part of creating backdoors or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe command lines for the PowerShell instances catch my eye. They're testing paths and executing scripts, which could indicate that someone is trying to establish persistence or check if certain files exist before proceeding with more harmful actions. The script names like \"modulo_ativo.objeto\" seem generic but might be part of a custom malware setup.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While PowerShell often loads many modules, the specific ones here don't immediately ring alarm bells, but combined with other activities, it could suggest something more malicious.\n\nThe frequency of these events in a short period is concerning. Several registry writes and process creations within a few minutes might indicate automated or script-based activity trying to establish persistence or spread across systems.\n\nPutting this all together: powershell.exe executing scripts, file operations, pipe creation, and repeated registry modifications from chrome.exe. These could be signs of an attacker establishing a presence on the system, possibly using PowerShell for execution and Chrome as a decoy or part of a larger campaign. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including file deletions, script creations, registry modifications, and the use of pipes suggest possible malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create new files and set content in various paths. For example, the first few events show commands like New-Item and Set-Content with paths ending in .bat scripts. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can execute malicious code.\n\nNext, there are file creation and deletion events. One event shows a file being created in the user's AppData directory, which is a common location for temporary files. Another deletes that same file shortly after, which might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by leaving traces.\n\nLooking at process activities, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe creating processes, accessing other processes, and loading various DLLs. This could be part of legitimate operations, but repeated process creations and accesses can be a red flag for potential malicious activity, especially if combined with file manipulations.\n\nRegistry events are also present where both powershell.exe and conhost.exe set registry values. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or configure system settings without user knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a PowerShell script is being tested for existence before exiting. This might be part of a check mechanism, which can sometimes be used by attackers to ensure their malicious scripts aren't already present or to bypass certain security measures.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of creating and modifying files with .bat extensions via PowerShell, file deletions to clean up traces, process activities that could indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation, registry modifications for persistence, and script checks. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the combination of these actions isn't typical of normal user behavior and aligns with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are creating, accessing, and modifying files in various paths.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check the existence of certain files using Test-Path. These commands exit 0 or 1 based on whether these files exist. This could indicate a script checking if specific files are present, possibly as part of some automated process or maybe to ensure certain conditions are met.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. Then, it deletes that same file shortly after. Creating and then deleting a script file could be part of testing permissions or checking if scripts are allowed to run, which might be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. That command typically outputs the current user's information, so seeing it without much context makes me wonder why it's being executed in this scenario. It could be part of some legitimate process but might also be used by attackers to gather information.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that powershell.exe accesses various files and registry values, which isn't unusual on its own. However, the combination of these actions—especially the repeated file checks and deletions—is concerning. These behaviors could indicate a script trying to stay undetected or attempting to execute malicious commands after verifying certain conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there are references to MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are related to Windows Defender. It's possible that powershell.exe is interacting with these files for legitimate reasons, but I can't rule out the possibility of tampering or bypass attempts.\n\nOverall, while some events could be part of normal operations, the repeated use of powershell.exe and the file deletions after creation, along with the user running whoami.exe, raise suspicions. These actions don't clearly indicate malicious behavior, but they're unusual enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions and file operations that may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that checks if certain files exist in different paths. It uses Test-Path which could be a red flag because it's often used in scripts to check for the presence of malicious files.\n\nLooking at the second event, there's another powershell.exe process accessing something from the registry. Powershell interacting with the registry is common but sometimes attackers use it to hide their tracks or modify system configurations.\n\nThe third event again has powershell.exe being created and executing a command that checks a different file path. The repeated pattern of checking various paths using powershell suggests some kind of script running multiple checks, which could be malicious behavior as it might be probing for specific files that indicate previous activity.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing or loading images like mscoree.dll and mspclient.dll. These are legitimate system files, but sometimes attackers load these to avoid detection or to drop additional payloads.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted in the same directory under Temporary Files. This could be an attempt to leave temporary files which were later cleaned up, indicating potential malicious activity trying to erase evidence.\n\nOther events involve whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The use of cmd with \/c and IF statements suggests command-line scripting. While not inherently malicious, it's another layer that might be part of a larger script intended to check conditions or execute commands based on file existence.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe across multiple processes with varying command lines is concerning. It looks like the same script is being executed in different contexts, possibly attempting to bypass detection by running checks from various locations. This kind of behavior is often seen in APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) or other sophisticated attacks where attackers try to remain undetected and ensure their malicious payloads are present.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the consistent pattern of powershell.exe processes checking for specific files across different directories stands out as suspicious. It's not just isolated incidents but a series of actions that seem coordinated, which makes me think this could be part of an attack chain where the attacker is verifying the presence or absence of certain files to proceed with further malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of registry access, file creation\/deletion, and command-line tools being used alongside powershell.exe adds layers to the potential threat. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the sequence and repetition make it more likely that something malicious is occurring.\n\nSo, putting all this together, I think these events are indeed interesting for further investigation because they exhibit signs of potentially malicious activity, particularly related to file checks and system modifications which could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running with varying command lines indicate possible script execution, which could be malicious.\n\n2. **Analyze Command Lines:**\n   - Commands using `Test-Path` to check for file existence across different paths suggest probing behavior, often seen in attacks to verify the presence of malware components.\n\n3. **Check File Operations:**\n   - Creation and subsequent deletion of temporary files might indicate an attempt to clean up evidence after performing malicious activities.\n\n4. **Examine Registry Access:**\n   - Powershell accessing registry values could be for persistence or to modify system configurations, both common in attacks.\n\n5. **Monitor Use of Other Tools:**\n   - `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` being used with conditional statements might be part of a larger script to execute commands based on previous file checks.\n\n6. **Assess Overall Pattern:**\n   - The repeated use of powershell.exe across different contexts and the sequence of events suggest a coordinated attack, possibly indicating an APT or sophisticated threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe series of events involving `powershell.exe` processes checking for files in various directories, combined with registry accesses and other tools, exhibit characteristics indicative of potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain aimed at verifying the presence of malware components or preparing the system for further exploitation. Therefore, this batch of log events is indeed interesting for investigation to understand the nature and scope of any underlying threat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interested\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The events show a pattern of suspicious activity involving powershell.exe processes checking multiple file paths, registry accesses, and other tools which may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are instances where 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe' are being executed. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines for powershell.exe seem to be checking if certain files exist in specific paths using Test-Path. This could indicate someone trying to verify the presence of particular files, possibly malicious ones.\n\nI notice that some events are about file creation and deletion. For example, there's a file being created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a random-looking name. Then it's immediately deleted. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting temporary files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or to execute malicious code without leaving long traces.\n\nThere are also events related to image loading and registry accesses, which could be part of normal operations but might also indicate attempts to load malicious libraries or modify system configurations.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines. Each time it's executed, it seems to check a different file path. This pattern suggests an attempt to validate multiple locations, possibly trying to ensure certain files are present before proceeding with something else, like downloading additional components or executing commands.\n\nThe fact that some processes are marked as 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' might indicate the script is interacting deeply with system services, which could be a sign of attempting to gain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it seems like there's a sequence of events indicating potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe, combined with file operations that don't seem necessary for normal user activities, and multiple checks across different directories, make me think this batch is indeed interesting for investigation. There's enough evidence to suggest possible unauthorized access or an attack in progress.\n\nI should also consider if there are any benign reasons for such activity. For example, system administrators might run scripts that check file existence across various paths, but the combination of quick file creation\/deletion and varied command lines makes it less likely. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe with specific arguments often raises red flags in cybersecurity contexts.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as 'interesting' for further investigation due to the suspicious patterns observed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events indicate potential malicious activity involving powershell.exe executing commands that check file existence across multiple paths and creating\/deleting temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used maliciously to execute scripts and commands. The fact that it's appearing multiple times suggests some automated process or potential misuse.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog, there are Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create events. These actions by themselves aren't always bad, but when combined with powershell.exe, they could indicate malicious activity like loading modules (ImageLoad), creating files (FileCreate), modifying registry entries (RegistryEvent), accessing processes (ProcessAccess), or spawning new processes (ProcessCreate).\n\nI also see a whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is generally used to get user information, its execution in conjunction with powershell might be part of an attack chain to gather system info.\n\nThe command lines for some powershell.exe instances are lengthy and include checks for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example, they're checking if \"C:\\tarefa_geral\\unidade_logico\\tarefa_logico\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" exists. The pattern here is that they're testing various paths to see if a malicious script exists, which might indicate an attempt to execute it if present.\n\nThere are multiple events where the same checks are performed on different paths (like C:\\pacote_temporario, C:\\estrutura_comum, etc.). This repetition suggests an automated search for a specific file across several locations. The fact that they're checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is concerning because that script name often relates to keylogging or data theft activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted shortly after. For example, the file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\" is created and then deleted. This behavior might be part of an attempt to bypass script execution policies by creating a test script temporarily and deleting it if detected.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with varied command lines that check for malicious scripts across multiple directories and the creation\/deletion of temporary files are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. This could be part of a larger attack strategy to execute code or gather information without being detected for a long time.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs is indicative of potential malicious activity and should be investigated further.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell Instances**: The extensive use of powershell.exe raises suspicion as it's commonly used in cyberattacks to execute scripts and commands.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: A temporary script file is created and then deleted, which may indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies or test the environment without leaving traces.\n\n3. **Command-Line Checks for Scripts**: The repeated checks across different paths for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" suggest an attempt to execute a malicious script that might be used for keylogging or data theft.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access**: Modifying registry entries and accessing processes can be signs of privilege escalation or installation of persistent malware.\n\n5. **Use of whoami.exe**: While not inherently malicious, its execution alongside powershell could be part of an attack chain to gather system information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs exhibit behavior consistent with potential malicious activities, such as script injection attempts and process manipulation. Investigating the origin of these commands and checking for any signs of unauthorized access or data exfiltration is crucial."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial few events, there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes being executed with specific command lines checking for the presence of a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because keystroke loggers are often used maliciously to capture user input, which could be sensitive information like passwords.\n\nNext, I see that the same PowerShell commands are checking different paths (C:\\tarefa_temporario\\componente_padrao\\entrada_geral\\src and C:\\unidade_logico\\elemento_logico\\elemento_principal\\src). This repeated check in different directories might indicate an attempt to locate or ensure the presence of a malicious script, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and shipping, so its activity alone isn't necessarily suspicious unless it's doing something unusual with logs or files. In this case, creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file seems normal, but I'll keep an eye out for other activities related to it.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This is interesting because modifying files in the Startup folder or similar locations can allow persistence across reboots, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nThere are several events where processes like powershell.exe, whoami.exe, notepad.exe, and calc.exe interact with registry values or perform file operations. While some of these actions could be benign, others might indicate privilege escalation or configuration changes that shouldn't occur during normal operation.\n\nLooking further down, there's a lot of network activity from chrome.exe, including multiple Network connection detected events and DnsQuery tasks. Although Chrome is a common browser, frequent network connections could be part of legitimate browsing behavior, but it's worth monitoring if they seem异常.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated use of PowerShell.exe with specific command lines. The script name Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which is concerning for potential unauthorized data collection. Additionally, the fact that the same script is being checked in multiple directories implies an attempt to ensure its execution or perhaps spread across different locations.\n\nI also notice several events where svchost.exe writes to the registry and connects to network resources. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process but can be hijacked by malware. Any unusual activity from it, especially network connections, could be red flags.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are multiple indicators that suggest potential malicious behavior, particularly the repeated attempts to execute or check for a suspicious PowerShell script and the use of svchost.exe and other processes in ways that might not align with normal operations. The combination of registry modifications, file creations in non-standard locations, and network activities adds up to make this batch of events worth investigating further.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I would conclude that this batch is interesting for investigation due to the suspicious script checks, potential persistence mechanisms, and unusual process behaviors indicating possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of JSONL events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Suspicious Script Checks**: Multiple PowerShell.exe processes check for the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in different directories. This script's name suggests it may capture keystrokes, a common tactic in malware.\n\n2. **File Creation by winlogbeat.exe**: While winlogbeat is typically benign, its activity could be monitored for any unusual file operations beyond standard log management.\n\n3. **Registry and File Modifications**: Processes like PowerShell.exe modifying registry values or creating files in the Startup folder may indicate attempts at persistence across system reboots.\n\n4. **Network Activity from Chrome.exe**: While normal for a browser, the frequency of network connections and DNS queries could warrant closer inspection if deemed异常.\n\n5. **Unusual Svchost.exe Behavior**: As a legitimate process that can be hijacked by malware, its network activity requires attention.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe events collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, particularly due to the suspicious script checks and unusual process activities. This batch is deemed interesting for further investigation. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"interest_level\": \"high\",\n  \"suspicious_activities\": [\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"powershell_command_execution\",\n      \"details\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"file_creation_in_non_standard_location\",\n      \"details\": \"File creation by winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell.exe in user directories.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"registry_modifications\",\n      \"details\": \"Processes like svchost.exe modifying registry values, possibly indicating unauthorized changes.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"network_activity_from_legitimate_processes\",\n      \"details\": \"Frequent network connections and DNS queries from chrome.exe and svchost.exe.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"Investigate the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, monitor file and registry changes, and analyze network traffic for anomalies.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format with each line representing an event. Each event has three main parts: process information, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nLooking through the events, there's a significant number of entries related to powershell.exe. Specifically, multiple events show powershell.exe being executed with certain command lines, like \"{ls -recurse\\\\nget-childitem -recurse\\\\ngci -recurse}\". Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so this could be red flag.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation and subsequent deletion of a file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1\". The fact that this script was created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces after execution. This behavior is often seen in malicious scripts trying to evade analysis.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, the combination with other suspicious activities could raise concerns.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for whoami.exe, which is typically used to determine user information. Alone, this might not be concerning, but when combined with powershell activity, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering tactics.\n\nFurthermore, there are Pipe Created events and Provider\/Engine Lifecycle tasks related to powershell.exe. These can indicate communication channels between processes or potential lateral movement within a network.\n\nWhile some entries like the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat.exe seem benign (likely from a log management tool), they don't outweigh the suspicious activities involving powershell and file handling.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows signs that could be indicative of malicious behavior. The repeated powershell executions with specific commands, coupled with file creation\/deletion and potential communication mechanisms, make this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts, file creation and deletion, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. I need to return a single classification as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be associated with malicious activities. The fact that it's creating a file might not be suspicious on its own, but I should note the filename and path.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating another file in the same directory as 'winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log management, so its activity should be normal unless there's something unusual about the path or filename.\n\nThe third event again involves powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, but they're also common in malware to persistence. However, without knowing the specific key being modified, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThe fourth event shows powershell.exe accessing a process. Process access events could indicate legitimate activity or potential malicious behavior like process injection or lateral movement within a network.\n\nLooking at all these together, I notice that powershell.exe is involved in multiple activities—file creation and registry changes. This might raise some flags because attackers often use powershell for its scripting capabilities to execute malicious commands. Additionally, the file names don't immediately seem suspicious, but without knowing their content or purpose, it's hard to be certain.\n\nHowever, considering that winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log management, its activity doesn't add much concern unless there's something wrong with how it's being used here. The combination of powershell and winlogbeat might indicate configuration changes or script execution related to log collection, which could be part of normal system administration.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while each event on its own isn't highly suspicious, the pattern involving multiple actions by powershell, especially file creation and registry modifications, is worth investigating. Malicious actors often use such tools for persistence or data exfiltration, so it's better to be cautious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
