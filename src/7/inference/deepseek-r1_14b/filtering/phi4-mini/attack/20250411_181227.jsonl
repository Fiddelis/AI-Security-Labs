{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events are all from powershell.exe processes. Each one has a command line that creates a scheduled task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. The tasks are set to execute calc.exe at logon, with administrative privileges. This seems suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks could be an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. Using calc.exe might seem benign, but in the context of these logs, it's worth noting.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and processes. The registry writes could be part of installing these scheduled tasks. There's also a process create event for powershell.exe executing another script that creates and then deletes a temporary .ps1 file in the Temp directory. This temporary file creation and deletion might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or test permissions, which is concerning.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing registry values, but these are more common and less likely to be malicious unless there's unusual behavior associated with them. However, since most of the suspicious activity is coming from powershell.exe, that's where I should focus.\n\nThe fact that multiple scheduled tasks are being created with similar names and actions suggests a possible automated script or tool trying to establish persistence on the system. The use of administrative privileges in the task principal could mean the attacker wants to run calc.exe at logon with high privileges, which is a red flag for potential escalation.\n\nThe temporary .ps1 file created by powershell.exe might have been used to execute malicious code that gets cleaned up after execution, making it harder to trace. This kind of behavior is often seen in attacks where adversaries try to leave minimal footprints.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with administrative tasks and temporary files raises concerns about potential unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms being established. Therefore, these logs should be investigated further for signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events presents several red flags that warrant investigation:\n\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations**: Several powershell.exe processes created multiple scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. These tasks are set to execute calc.exe at logon with administrative privileges, which is suspicious as it could be an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\n2. **Registry Access and File Operations**: Powershell.exe accessed registry values and created\/deleted a temporary .ps1 file in the Temp directory. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity, possibly indicating an attempt to execute arbitrary code or test system permissions.\n\n3. **Benign Activities**: While chrome.exe activities are noted, they don't indicate suspicious behavior on their own.\n\n4. **Potential Attack Indicators**: The repeated creation of scheduled tasks and temporary files with powershell.exe execution suggest possible unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms, common in cyberattacks to avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs should be thoroughly investigated due to the concerning activities involving powershell.exe and potential system compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event involves a PowerShell command that creates a scheduled task executing calc.exe on startup. That's definitely suspicious because creating tasks with administrative privileges could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry, repeated writes without clear reason might indicate something's amiss, especially if they're not related to normal operations.\n\nThen, I see several events where remote commands are executed. These could be attempts to run code over a network, which is a red flag for potential remote attacks or unauthorized access.\n\nLooking further, there's an event from WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll, which might indicate manipulation of scheduled tasks—something that could be malicious since WMI is often used in attacks.\n\nsvchost.exe events show registry writes and creating a file. svchost is legitimate but often used by malware to hide activities. Creating files without proper reason raises concerns about persistence or dropped malware components.\n\nAnother PowerShell event creates a file in the Startup folder, which is a common tactic for ensuring malicious code runs at startup. Additionally, there's a Registry write from conhost.exe, which might be attempting to modify system configurations stealthily.\n\nThere are some benign events like loading DLLs and creating configuration files, but considering the context with other suspicious activities, these could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled task creations using PowerShell, remote command executions, registry manipulations by various processes, file creation in sensitive locations—all these factors point to potential malicious activity. The volume and combination suggest a coordinated effort rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events such as PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks, remote command executions, registry modifications, and file creations in unusual locations. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first six entries are all from chrome.exe and involve a registry value being set. While registry changes can be indicators of malicious activity, especially when done by non-system processes, seeing the same process (chrome.exe) make multiple registry modifications in quick succession might not be unusual depending on what Chrome is doing. However, if this happened multiple times without any other anomalies, it could still be something to look into.\n\nThe seventh event is another chrome.exe but this time it's a DNS query. That's more normal because browsers do perform DNS queries as part of their operation, so this alone isn't concerning unless the domain queried is suspicious.\n\nMoving on to the eighth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is typically an agent used for log management, so it's expected that it creates files here. Unless there's something unusual about the filename or path, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThe last event is powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The creation of an arbitrary file isn't inherently malicious, but combined with other actions from powershell.exe, it could be a sign of something more serious, like downloading or executing malicious code.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together: multiple registry writes by chrome.exe might not be suspicious on their own, especially if they're part of normal operation. The DNS query is standard. The winlogbeat activity seems benign. However, the powershell.exe creating a file stands out because it's a common tool for attackers. If I were investigating, I'd check what PowerShell was doing at that time—maybe running a script or downloading something.\n\nPutting it all together, while most events are normal, the presence of powershell.exe activity makes this batch worth looking into. There might be nothing malicious, but there's also an elevated risk here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
