{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The first thing I notice is that multiple entries involve powershell.exe, which is a common tool used in both legitimate scripts and malicious activities. Powershell can execute code directly or load modules, making it a favorite for attackers.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing the registry (Registry value set tasks). This could be part of persistence mechanisms, like adding registry keys to ensure the malware runs at startup. Additionally, some events show image loads from various .NET framework components, which might indicate attempts to load malicious DLLs or execute code.\n\nThe command lines in these powershell.exe processes stand out. They contain complex scripts that interact with system information and attempt to capture screen shots by accessing the virtual screen and saving images to temporary files. This behavior is suspicious because legitimate applications rarely take screenshots without clear justification, especially when combined with other actions like registry modifications.\n\nI also notice that some of these events are marked under 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might suggest an attempt to load or unload specific components dynamically. This could be part of a broader attack strategy to avoid detection or to execute malicious activities in stages.\n\nConsidering all the events together, it seems like there's a pattern of powershell.exe processes performing multiple actions that are indicative of potential malicious behavior. The combination of registry access, image loading, and repeated attempts to capture screen shots adds up to a concerning profile. While not conclusive on their own, these collectively suggest possible malicious activity that merits further investigation.\n\nI'm confident enough based on the patterns observed that this batch is relevant for closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes with command lines attempting to capture screen shots and interacting with system information, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I'm dealing with here. The user provided a JSONL of events and wants me to classify the entire batch as interesting or not. So, first, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: multiple powershell.exe processes are creating and deleting files in temporary directories. That's suspicious because attackers often use Powershell for lateral movement or persistence. The script names seem generic, but the act of creating and then deleting a file might be part of some malicious activity, like trying to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe is executing a command that captures the screen and saves it as a PNG in TEMP. That's definitely something to look into because screen capturing can be part of data exfiltration or surveillance malware.\n\nThen, I see another remote command execution. That's a big red flag. Remote commands can allow attackers to execute any code on the system, which is a clear sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple registry value sets from powershell.exe and other processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe. Registry changes can be used for persistence or to modify system behavior in ways that might hide malicious activities. The frequency here is notable, especially when combined with other events involving Powershell.\n\nI also notice a lot of Pipe Created events from chrome.exe. While legitimate applications use pipes, unusual pipe activity can sometimes indicate command injection or communication between processes, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated Powershell activities (file creation\/deletion, screen capture, remote commands), registry modifications, and suspicious pipe creations suggest a coordinated sequence of actions that are indicative of malicious behavior. The use of multiple techniques (registry changes, file operations, process injection) points towards possible persistence mechanisms or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nTherefore, the batch is definitely interesting because it shows signs of potential exploitation or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events involving Powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, creating and deleting files, and performing screen captures. Additionally, there are remote command executions and numerous registry modifications, which could indicate malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
