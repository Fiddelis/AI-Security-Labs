Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Microsoft Edge Update and setup.exe. The process names like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and setup.exe creating files seem normal for updates or installations. I don't see anything immediately suspicious here, but it's worth keeping an eye on the file paths to ensure they're legitimate.\n\nThen there are several events involving svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so this could be part of normal operations unless it's doing something unusual like accessing unexpected registry keys.\n\nThere's also a command line for powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That's interesting because even though it's restricted, seeing PowerShell commands in logs can sometimes indicate script execution which might be malicious. I need to look at the exact command: it's querying INF files for specific patterns. That seems like part of a legitimate process, maybe antivirus or system checks, but it could also be a way to execute code if not properly controlled.\n\nAdditionally, there are user account management events without associated processes, which might indicate credential changes or new accounts being created. Multiple such entries suggest some kind of user activity, possibly during an update or login scripts.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory is likely just the log shipping tool doing its job, nothing to worry about there.\n\nLooking at all events together, while each individually might not raise red flags, the combination shows a lot of system process activities—updates, service host operations, and script execution. This could be normal during an update or configuration change, but without more context, it's hard to tell if any event is malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because most events are typical system behaviors, though I'd keep monitoring for any deviations in the future.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events appears to be related to normal system operations and updates. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Multiple entries show MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating files, which is expected during an update process.\n\n2. **Setup and Installation Processes**: Setup.exe creating temporary files is typical for software installations or updates.\n\n3. **svchost.exe Registry Interactions**: Svchost.exe modifying registry values is normal as it's a common system process handling services.\n\n4. **PowerShell Execution with Restricted Policy**: The command in powershell.exe seems to be checking INF files, possibly part of legitimate scanning but could indicate script execution.\n\n5. **User Account Management Events**: These might relate to user logins or script-based account changes, which are normal during updates or system operations.\n\n6. **winlogbeat.exe Logging**: This is likely the tool shipping logs and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: While each event has potential red flags, collectively they appear to be part of legitimate system processes like updates and monitoring. No immediate signs of malicious activity are present."}

Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are two main processes involved: \"MpCmdRun.exe\" and \"git.exe\". MpCmdRun is related to Windows Defender, so its activities are likely legitimate. The events show it loading various DLLs which seems normal for antivirus software.\n\nNext, the git.exe entries are all about file creation in a node_modules directory. This looks like someone is working on a Node.js project. The paths point to functions within the semver package, which is a versioning tool commonly used in development. The fact that multiple JavaScript files are being created here doesn't raise any red flags—it's typical during a build or install process.\n\nI'm checking if there's any indication of malicious activity. For MpCmdRun.exe, creating temp files and loading known modules isn't suspicious. As for git.exe, it's standard in development environments to see file creations in node_modules. There's no evidence of unusual paths, access to sensitive files, or signs of exfiltration.\n\nConsidering the timestamps and the frequency of events, they seem to be happening within a short period, which aligns with normal user activity, like installing packages or running scripts during a build process.\n\nSo, putting it all together, both processes are acting as expected without any signs of malicious behavior. The activities are consistent with legitimate software operations and don't indicate potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation and image load activities by Windows Defender (MpCmdRun.exe) and Node.js development tools (git.exe), which are not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all mention \"git.exe\" as the process name. The Windows log task says it's a file creation event, specifically under the rule FileCreate. The file paths are pointing to different .js files inside the node_modules folder of a project called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". \n\nSo, what do I know about node_modules? It's a standard directory in Node.js projects where third-party packages and their dependencies are stored. Git.exe is typically used for version control, so when someone clones a repository or updates it, git might be creating files in the node_modules.\n\nThe first event creates \"valid.js\", then \"index.js\", followed by \"internal\" which seems like a directory. Then there's debug.js, re.js—these look like JavaScript files that are part of the semver package. Semver is a tool for semantic versioning, so it makes sense to see these files being created when installing or updating dependencies.\n\nLooking further down, there's serialize-javascript and set-blocking packages. These are also common Node.js modules. Each file path includes LICENSE, README.md, index.js, and package.json—those are standard files you'd expect in a node_modules directory. The fact that multiple files from different packages are being created suggests that this is part of the setup or update process for these dependencies.\n\nI'm noticing that all events have the same process name, task type, and similar file paths. There's no variation in the user account or any signs of unusual permissions. Also, since git.exe is involved, it could be a legitimate activity during development, like someone pulling changes from a repository and installing dependencies.\n\nIs there anything here that stands out as suspicious? Well, sometimes malicious actors might try to create files that mimic normal operations but have different content. But in this case, all the file names and paths look genuine for a Node.js project setup. There's no indication of file deletions, access outside expected directories, or any unusual times (like late at night). \n\nAlso, considering the structure of the node_modules folder being populated with these files, it doesn't seem like an attack vector. Unless someone is exploiting a vulnerability in one of these packages, but that would likely involve more specific indicators beyond just file creation events.\n\nI don't see any evidence of privilege escalation or lateral movement here. All the activity is contained within the user's Downloads directory and the project folder. There are no signs of files being created outside this scope, which could indicate an expansion of access.\n\nIn summary, these logs appear to be part of a normal software development process—installing dependencies with npm using git for version control. Without additional context or unusual patterns beyond what's provided, there's nothing here that suggests malicious activity or a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files during the setup or update of Node.js dependencies in a development project.

The key fields in each event are the process name, the task from winlog, and the file path.\n\nThe process name across all events is \"git.exe\". This suggests that Git is being executed, which is common for version control tasks like cloning repositories or managing files.\n\nThe task field consistently says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that each event is related to a new file being created. That's normal when working with files in Git operations, especially during initial setups or updates.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages. For example, there are entries like \"set-function-length\", \"shebang-command\", and \"side-channel\". These are known npm packages, often used in Node.js projects.\n\nThe specific files created include various project-related files such as README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, and package.json. These are standard files that you'd expect to see when setting up or updating a node module. Additionally, there are test files and configuration files like tsconfig.json, which further indicates normal development activities.\n\nGiven that all events involve the creation of expected files by Git during typical npm package installations or updates, there's no indication of any unusual or malicious activity here.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines, each representing a different event. The task is to determine whether the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". Then, provide a concise justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on in each of these events. Let me look at one event first. Each JSON object has three main keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\".\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- The process name is \"git.exe\".\n- The winlog task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n- The file path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\signal-exit\".\n\nSo, it seems like the Git executable is creating a file. The path looks like it's inside a node_modules folder, which suggests this might be related to a Node.js project or some package installation.\n\nI notice that there are multiple events with similar structures but different file paths. Each one is under \"node_modules\" and has files like LICENSE.txt, index.js, package.json, etc. These are typical files found in a Node.js module directory. For example, package.json defines the dependencies for a project, and having multiple such files under node_modules implies that this is part of a larger project structure.\n\nSince all events involve \"git.exe\" creating files within the node_modules directory, it seems like Git is cloning or pulling a repository where these modules are being checked out. Node_modules is a standard folder in Node.js applications, so this activity is normal when setting up or updating a project that uses npm (Node Package Manager).\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file names, or activities outside the scope of typical Git operations. All the files are expected components of software packages.\n\nThe user account involved is \"fiddelis\", which seems to be a standard username. The paths lead me to believe this is happening on a Windows machine, given the backslashes in the file paths.\n\nGiven that all these events are part of normal development or build processes for a Node.js project, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent. It looks like legitimate activity related to software development.\n\nI should also consider whether the number of files created might be unusual. There are several files being created under node_modules from different modules (signal-exit, slice-ansi, sshpk). This could happen when installing multiple packages at once or during a build process. It's not an uncommon scenario in a development environment.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths don't seem to point to sensitive areas outside of the project directory. Everything is contained within \"fiddelis\"'s user folder and the specific course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), which suggests it's related to study or work projects.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm fairly certain that this activity is normal because it aligns with standard software development practices involving Git and npm. There are no red flags like encrypted files, unusual extensions, or activities in system directories.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole doesn't indicate any security concerns and can be classified as \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch of events does not indicate any security concerns. They represent normal activity associated with software development using Git and Node.js package management. The creation of files within the node_modules directory is typical during project setup or updates.\n\n**Classification:** NOT INTERESTING  \n**Confidence Score:** 0.95"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. So, I'm seeing multiple JSON objects, each representing an event. The common thread here is that the process name is always \"git.exe\". That tells me it's related to Git, which is a version control system. \n\nLooking deeper, each event has a task description: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, these are file creation events. The files being created are located in paths under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". That looks like a directory for a course or project.\n\nThe specific files mentioned include various .js and .md files, as well as package.json, readme.md, and license files. These are typical components of a Node.js module setup. For example, node_modules is a standard folder in JavaScript projects where third-party libraries are stored. The presence of modules like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc., suggests this is part of a software development environment.\n\nThe fact that all these events are from the same process (git.exe) and involve creating files in a node_modules directory makes me think this is related to installing dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Git is often used alongside npm for version control, especially when managing project dependencies.\n\nI'm checking if there's anything unusual here. Are these file creations happening at an odd time? The paths seem normal for a development setup. There's no indication of file deletions, access to sensitive files, or any signs of malicious activity like encryption or deletion patterns which could indicate ransomware or other attacks.\n\nThe frequency is also something to consider. If this were an attack, I might expect repeated attempts or other concurrent activities. But here, it's a series of file creations that fit the profile of a standard npm install operation followed by Git operations for version control.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own could be monitored, collectively they don't raise red flags. They align with typical user activities in a development environment, specifically installing and managing project dependencies through npm and tracking changes via Git.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is normal for software development using Node.js and Git.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The task under winlog is \"File created\", which suggests that files are being added or modified. The file paths point to various locations inside a node_modules folder, like supports-color and tcomb-validation.\n\nI remember that when you install Node.js packages using npm, it downloads and extracts the modules into the node_modules directory. Git might be involved in this process if someone is cloning a repository or managing packages. So these events could just be part of installing dependencies for a project.\n\nThe paths are all within \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which seems like a user's download directory, specifically under a folder named after a course on software quality. This makes me think that the user is working on a school project or some development task related to their studies.\n\nI don't see any unusual processes or file accesses here. All files being created are typical for npm modules—LICENSE, README.md, changelog files, and JavaScript libraries. There's no indication of anything malicious like encrypted files, executable binaries outside expected paths, or access to sensitive areas beyond the project folder.\n\nThe repetition of \"git.exe\" creating files in a predictable structure also aligns with normal development activities. If there were signs of privilege escalation, unknown processes, or attempts to modify system files, that would raise flags. But here, everything seems routine and related to software development.\n\nSo putting it all together, these logs are likely just part of someone setting up their development environment or updating dependencies. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data breaches, or suspicious activities. Therefore, the batch doesn't seem interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation during Git operations within a development environment, specifically involving Node.js modules, which is expected behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events provided, each one is a JSON object representing an event in JSONL format. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path information.\n\nThe process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". Git is a version control system widely used for software development. It's a legitimate tool, so seeing it execute files isn't unusual on its own. The task under winlog is consistently \"File created\", which indicates that the event is related to the creation of a file.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different JavaScript and TypeScript files located in the node_modules directory. Specifically, these are within \"C:\\Users\\...\\\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\". The filenames include various functions like fromJSON.d.ts, func.js, getDefaultInterfaceName.js, etc. These seem to be part of a Node.js module, likely related to type checking or validations since tcomb is a library for TypeScript that helps with combinatorial types.\n\nSo the events are all about Git creating several files in the node_modules directory. Now, from a cybersecurity standpoint, I need to consider if this activity is indicative of malicious behavior. Let's think:\n\n1. **Legitimacy of Process**: Git.exe is a legitimate process and commonly used in development environments for cloning repositories, managing branches, etc. It’s not typically associated with malware.\n\n2. **Nature of the Event**: The events are about file creation. Legitimate processes often create files as part of their operation. In this case, since it's node_modules, it suggests that Git is setting up a project structure or installing dependencies, which is standard during development.\n\n3. **Volume of Events**: There are 14 events in total, each creating a different file. While some malicious activities might generate multiple events, the pattern here aligns with typical Git operations when initializing a new repository or during setup.\n\n4. **File Locations and Names**: The files created are all within node_modules, which is where Node.js packages are stored. The filenames suggest they're part of a library's source code, which further indicates normal development activities rather than anything suspicious.\n\n5. **Lack of Anomalies**: There’s no indication of file paths pointing to unusual locations, nor are the files executable or scripts that might execute on startup. Everything seems contained within project-specific directories.\n\n6. **Timeframe and Frequency**: If these events occurred over a short period, it could be during an initial setup or a build process. Without knowing the exact timeline, but given that they're all part of the same batch, it's likely a single operation related to Git initializing a new project or restoring dependencies.\n\nPotential red flags would include things like multiple processes from different binaries creating files in unexpected locations, or file paths leading to system directories (like System32). Since none of these are present here, and everything is within a user’s development directory, the activities don't raise alarms.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, this batch of events doesn't appear to be indicative of malicious behavior. They're consistent with normal Git operations in a software development environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files by git.exe during legitimate file operations within a node_modules directory, which is typical for development environments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
