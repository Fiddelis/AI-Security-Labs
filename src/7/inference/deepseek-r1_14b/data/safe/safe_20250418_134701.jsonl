So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to represent an event where the process name is git.exe, and the task is File created with a specific rule. The file paths all point to different .d.ts files under the cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp directory.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the same process, git.exe, is creating multiple files in quick succession. That makes sense if someone is working on a project where they're cloning or updating a repository. Cypress and lodash are common tools in web development for testing and utility functions, respectively. The file paths look like TypeScript definition files, which are standard in projects using TypeScript.\n\nNow, considering the nature of git.exe performing file creation tasks—this typically happens when files are being checked out from a Git repository. So, if this is happening during normal development activities, these events wouldn't raise any red flags. It's expected behavior when someone is pulling down updates or initializing a project.\n\nI don't see anything unusual here, like failed logins, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute unknown binaries. All the files are part of the Cypress types for lodash functions, which are legitimate and widely used in the developer community.\n\nThe frequency of these events—15 in total—is also within what you'd expect when setting up a project or updating dependencies. There's no indication that they're happening outside of normal working hours or in an environment where such activities aren't typical.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the file paths' structure. They all follow a predictable pattern, which aligns with how modules and their type definitions are organized in Node.js projects. This consistency makes it less likely to be part of malicious activity, as attackers usually target more sensitive or unexpected locations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating multiple files that fit within a standard development setup, no signs of anomalies or suspicious activities, and consistent with legitimate Git operations during project setup or updates.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the data, all entries have the same structure: a process named \"git.exe\" creating files under specific paths. Each file is located in the node_modules folder within a user directory. The files being created are .d.ts files, which are TypeScript declaration files typically used in Node.js modules for type checking.\n\nI notice that every event is from the same process and all tasks are related to \"File created\". The consistency here makes me think these aren't unusual activities if this system regularly uses tools like Git or Cypress. Since the paths involve node_modules, it's likely part of a development environment where packages are being installed or updated.\n\nI should consider whether creating multiple files in this directory is normal. During package installations with npm or yarn, especially when using tools like Cypress, it's common for several files to be written at once. The fact that they're all .d.ts files reinforces the idea that this is part of a development setup rather than malicious activity.\n\nThere's no indication of any suspicious behavior here. No unusual file paths, access to sensitive areas, or unexpected processes. All events are within an expected directory structure for software development tools and modules.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these log entries don't raise any red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 17 of them. All the events seem to be similar. They all involve the process \"git.exe\" creating files in a specific directory.\n\nFirst, I notice that every line starts with {\"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}}, which tells me that the Git executable is involved. The next part is the winlog task, which says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that each event is logging the creation of a file.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. The filenames vary but end with .d.ts, which I know is related to TypeScript declaration files. These are part of the Cypress testing framework's type definitions for lodash functions.\n\nSince all these events are from Git creating files in a node_modules directory, this seems like standard behavior when installing or updating dependencies. Node.js and npm typically use git under the hood, especially with package managers. So when someone runs npm install or similar commands, Git might be used to check out certain repositories, and during that process, it creates these files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, paths outside the expected node_modules structure, or indicators like execution attempts or deletions. It's all about creating type definition files which are normal in a development environment using TypeScript and Cypress.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm 95% sure this is not suspicious because these activities align with typical software development workflows. The only reason it's not 100% is that sometimes attackers might mimic legitimate processes, but in this case, the consistency and file types strongly suggest normal behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating multiple TypeScript declaration files under node_modules, which is typical during development with npm or yarn.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. The goal is to determine whether this batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" \n\nLooking at the events, each line represents an event where a file was created by the process `git.exe`. Specifically, these files are TypeScript definition (.d.ts) files located within the `node_modules` directory of a Cypress installation. The paths all point to different type-checking files for various functions like `isBoolean`, `isBuffer`, and others.\n\nI need to consider whether multiple file creations by `git.exe` in this context are unusual or indicate potential malicious activity. Since `git.exe` is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments, it's normal for it to create files during operations like cloning repositories or extracting dependencies. The presence of these `.d.ts` files suggests that they're part of a TypeScript project setup, which is standard in modern web development.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency and number of events. There are 17 events here, all occurring within the same process and directory structure. This doesn't seem excessive for a typical development environment where multiple files might be created or modified during a `git` operation.\n\nI should also think about whether there's any indication of suspicious behavior in these logs. The task field mentions \"File created\" with a specific rule, which indicates this is a standard file creation event. There are no signs of unusual access patterns, such as creating files in unexpected locations or multiple writes to the same file quickly, which could hint at malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, the file paths all fall under `node_modules`, which is a common directory for third-party libraries and modules. This makes me less concerned about these events being related to anything malicious since they're part of typical software development setup processes.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor system logs, this batch doesn't present any red flags.

The fact that multiple files are being created under a node_modules directory suggests this might be related to a development environment, perhaps during the installation or update of a package like Cypress or lodash.\n\nLooking at each event individually, they all report file creation tasks.

While it's a lot of files being created at once, in the context of installing multiple packages or during a build process, this can happen legitimately. It could be part of an automated script or CI\/CD pipeline where multiple files are generated as dependencies are resolved and installed.\n\nAnother angle: Could this be a sign of something malicious? Sometimes attackers might drop files into certain directories, but in this case, the path is under node_modules, which is expected for npm packages. There's no evidence here that these files are being used for anything harmful; they're just part of the project's structure.\n\nI should also think about the confidence level. While it's possible to have a false positive where legitimate activity is flagged as malicious, in this case, all signs point to normal development operations. The process name and file locations align with expected behavior for someone working on a software project that uses Git and npm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: these logs show multiple files being created by git.exe in a typical development environment. There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious intent. Therefore, the batch isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The events indicate legitimate file creation activities related to a development environment using Git and Node.js packages.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": 95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements across all these events are:\n\n1. **Process Name**: All events have \"git.exe\" as the process name.\n2. **Task Type**: Each event indicates that a file was created, specifically noted under winlog with the task \"File created\".\n3. **File Paths**: All files are located in the same directory: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" followed by different .d.ts files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all TypeScript declaration files for Lodash functions. These include methods like isError, isFinite, etc. The fact that multiple files are being created under this specific path suggests an installation or update of a node_modules directory, likely during a software build or setup process.\n\nGiven that \"git.exe\" is the process creating these files, it's probable that Git is cloning or pulling a repository, which includes these TypeScript definitions as part of a project's dependencies. This is a common occurrence in development environments when setting up projects with tools like npm or yarn that use Git for version control.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process name and file operations are typical during software development. There's no indication of unusual access times, writes to sensitive files, or other red flags often associated with security incidents.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation by the git.exe process during software development setup, which is normal and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nAll the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each one starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo, every single event here shows that the git.exe process is creating a file. The paths are all under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\" followed by different filenames like isSymbol.d.ts, isTypedArray.d.ts, and so on.\n\nFirst thought: Git is a version control system. It's common for developers to use it, especially in environments where node modules are involved since the path includes node_modules and cypress. The files being created here look like TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which makes sense because when you install or update node modules, sometimes typescript definitions get generated or updated.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but since all events have the same structure and are creating files in a predictable pattern, it seems like this is part of a normal installation or build process. There's no indication of any unusual activity, like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or any signs of file creation from unexpected processes.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is involved in creating these files doesn't raise red flags for me because during deployments or installations, especially with tools like npm or yarn, it's common to see various scripts and processes interacting with the file system. Since all the paths are within a user's Downloads directory and relate to a course named \"Qualidade de Software\" (which translates to Software Quality), this might be a student setting up their development environment.\n\nI don't see any evidence of malicious behavior here. The files being created are standard TypeScript type definitions, which are part of the normal setup when using libraries like lodash with TypeScript projects. There's no sign of executable files being created, nor any hidden or system files that could indicate persistence mechanisms or malware activity.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems like this batch is just part of a routine development process. So, I would classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's nothing unusual or concerning in the events provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating TypeScript definition files during normal development activities, which is expected behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with three main components: process info, Windows log details, and file information.\n\nFirst off, the process name in every single event is \"git.exe\". That's consistent across all logs. The task from the Windows log is always \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\", which indicates that a new file was made. The files being created are all located within the same directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. Each event specifies a different .d.ts file under this path, such as matches.d.ts, matchesProperty.d.ts, and so on.\n\nSo, breaking it down: git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in JavaScript projects. Node Modules are where third-party libraries are stored, and cypress refers to the Cypress testing framework. The _.d.ts files are TypeScript declaration files for lodash functions, which makes sense because Cypress might depend on lodash for utility functions.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are about creating files related to a development project, it's pretty normal during software development. If someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies, git could be cloning repositories, installing packages, or syncing changes, leading to the creation of these types of files.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is straightforward and aligns with typical development workflows. There's no indication of unusual file paths, unexpected processes, or activities that deviate from standard operations. Each event is an expected part of how a developer's environment would behave when working on a project that uses tools like git, npm (for managing node_modules), and Cypress.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's just normal file creation events during development setup or updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe related to a development project, which is typical and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. I've got a batch of 18 JSONL events that I need to analyze as a whole. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. \n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures: each is an object with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The process name is always \"git.exe\". The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths are variations within the same directory structure under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\", each ending with different .d.ts files.\n\nFirst, I should understand what these events represent. Git is a version control system, often used in software development. The \"File created\" events likely indicate that new files are being added to the repository. Given that they're all under node_modules and related to Cypress types, it seems like this could be part of a build or installation process for a project using Node.js.\n\nI need to assess if these activities are normal or potentially malicious. Legitimate git operations would involve creating files as part of adding new code, updating dependencies, or initial setup. The consistent use of \"git.exe\" and the file paths align with typical development workflows.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all end with \".d.ts\", which stands for TypeScript declaration files. These are standard in TypeScript projects to define interfaces and types without implementation. The specific files like \"pull.d.ts\" or \"random.d.ts\" are likely part of a library's type definitions, which would be expected during an npm install or similar process.\n\nConsidering the timestamps isn't possible here since they aren't provided, but if all these events occurred within a short timeframe, that could indicate a bulk operation. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But in general, installing dependencies can cause multiple files to be created quickly.\n\nI should also think about indicators of malicious activity. High privilege escalation, access to sensitive files, or unusual file creation patterns are red flags. Here, the process is git.exe, which is a common tool and not typically associated with malware unless it's part of an APT using it as a vector. However, in this case, the files being created are standard TypeScript definitions for a testing framework (Cypress), which doesn't raise any immediate alarms.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes, but without evidence of unusual access times, file hashes, or deviations from normal behavior, it's hard to justify marking these as suspicious. The event volume is 18, which might seem high, but during an initial setup or a large dependency update, this could be expected.\n\nI also need to consider the user context. If \"fiddelis\" is a legitimate user account, especially in a development environment, creating files under their profile for a project makes sense. Without signs of unauthorized access or multiple failed attempts, there's no indication of compromise here.\n\nLastly, I should think about what would make this batch interesting versus not. Since all events are consistent with each other and fit into a typical software development scenario, there's nothing unusual that stands out as malicious or concerning from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:** Each event indicates that a file was created by the `git.exe` process under a specific directory related to a Node.js project using Cypress.\n\n2. **Process Identification:** The use of `git.exe` suggests these are legitimate Git operations, typically part of software development workflows.\n\n3. **File Context:** The files are TypeScript declaration files (`*.d.ts`) for various functions and types, commonly used in TypeScript projects to define interfaces without implementation.\n\n4. **Path Analysis:** All file paths point to a Node.js module structure under `node_modules`, which is standard for installed packages and dependencies.\n\n5. **Event Pattern:** Multiple similar events within a short timeframe indicate bulk operations typical during dependency installations or project setup.\n\n6. **Indicator of Compromise (IOC):** No IOCs such as unusual file names, unexpected locations, or signs of unauthorized access are present.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** The activities are consistent with normal development processes and do not exhibit characteristics of malicious behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe entire batch of events is not considered interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. These events represent normal file creation operations during the setup or update of a Node.js project using Git, and there are no signs of suspicious activity."}
