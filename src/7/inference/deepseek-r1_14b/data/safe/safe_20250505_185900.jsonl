{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a bit confusing because it says \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"None\"},\"process\":null,\"file\":null. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but maybe it's just an empty or placeholder log entry. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are several events related to winlogbeat.exe. For example, the second event shows a Process Create task for winlogbeat.exe with a command line path pointing to where I'd expect it to be in a downloads folder. Then, there are multiple File Create tasks creating logs and lock files in that same directory. That seems normal if this is just the winlogbeat service running as intended.\n\nThen, looking at powershell.exe events: there's a Process Create task for powershell, followed by Image Load events showing it loading various DLLs which is standard for PowerShell execution. However, I notice that it creates a temporary file __PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1 and then immediately deletes it. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line for powershell.exe. These might be legitimate PowerShell operations, but having so many repeated entries could indicate something is off, maybe a script running in a loop or some automated process that shouldn't be happening.\n\nThe last few events show Image Load and Pipe Created actions by powershell.exe, which again are standard but combined with the file creation and deletion, it raises my concern. There's also an Engine Lifecycle event, which might not be alarming on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: winlogbeat is doing normal logging tasks, but the powershell.exe activity stands out because of the quick file creation\/deletion and multiple events that seem repetitive or unnecessary. This behavior could indicate that someone is using PowerShell to execute commands, possibly malicious scripts, which are being deleted to cover their tracks.\n\nI should consider whether this is just a legitimate user running PowerShell scripts or actual malicious activity. The fact that the temporary script is created and deleted so quickly makes me lean towards it being suspicious. Also, repeated Process Creates and events for the same process might suggest persistence mechanisms or multiple invocations trying to stay under the radar.\n\nSo overall, while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell activity with file manipulation that's designed to be transient could indicate malicious behavior worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including rapid file creation and deletion, which may indicate attempts to hide malicious scripts.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 70\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me look at each event one by one and see if there's anything unusual.\n\nThe first event says that the task was an Image Load with the rule \"ImageLoad\" from powershell.exe, accessing C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. Loading urlmon might be normal since it's a system file, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe second event is Process Create for ipconfig.exe with the command line \"\/all\". That seems standard—ipconfig is a legitimate utility, and using \/all is a typical way to view detailed network info. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nThe third event shows Process Access on powershell.exe without any file info. Powershell being accessed again could be part of normal script execution or something else. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe fourth event is File Create by winlogbeat.exe in a user directory, creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK tool for log shipping, so this seems benign. It's just setting up its configuration file.\n\nPutting them all together: two events involve powershell.exe—maybe the user runs scripts or has automation tools. The first event loads urlmon, which might be related to code execution or reflective DLL injection, a technique used in attacks. But since it's from powershell and accessing a legitimate system file, it could also be normal admin activity.\n\nHowever, considering that the same process (powershell.exe) is involved in both an Image Load and Process Access events, it raises some flags. Attackers often use powershell for command execution and lateral movement. The combination of these actions might indicate suspicious behavior, like loading a DLL to execute malicious code.\n\nOn the other hand, without more context like timestamps or repeated attempts, it's hard to be certain. But given that the same process is involved in two events and one involves a known system file accessed by powershell, which can be a vector for attacks, I think this batch might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe, including an Image Load and Process Access. Powershell is often used maliciously, and the combination of these actions may indicate potential suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
