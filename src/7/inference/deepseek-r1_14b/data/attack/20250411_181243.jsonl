{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is something we need to look into. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process being accessed. That's common because scripts often use it, but it might be worth noting. Then there's whoami.exe running; that seems normal for user identification. But the next few events keep showing PowerShell accessing different things and setting registry values. That could be suspicious because attackers sometimes use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, I see a command line with a long script involving net commands and other utilities. The fact that it's being executed multiple times raises an eyebrow. Plus, the file creation and deletion of a temporary .ps1 script might indicate they're trying to run something without persistence or maybe testing permissions.\n\nThe events repeat similar actions, which could mean someone is running a script in a loop or testing something over and over. The use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks seems odd too; that's not the usual event type I see with PowerShell scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the repetitive and potentially malicious use of PowerShell along with system commands makes this batch interesting for investigation. There might be an attempt to gather information about the system or escalate privileges, which are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated PowerShell process creations and activities that could indicate malicious behavior, such as script execution and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are two entries where powershell.exe is running a command line with a script that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls, dir, etc. PowerShell scripts can be tricky because they're often used for legitimate tasks but can also execute malicious code. The fact that it's invoking multiple system commands in one go might raise some flags.\n\nNext, there are a few events where net.exe and net1.exe are being run with user and localgroup arguments. These commands are typically used to manage network users and groups, which could be part of legitimate admin tasks but can also be signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement if not properly authorized.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is accessed multiple times and loads different DLLs like urlmon.dll. This might indicate script execution or downloading resources, which could be suspicious depending on the context.\n\nThere are several events labeled under 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management'. These seem to involve changes in user accounts or group memberships, which could be part of an attack chain where an attacker is trying to gain more access rights.\n\nThen there's a cmdkey.exe \/list command. This is used to list stored credentials, which might indicate that someone is trying to gather password information, a common step in compromising systems.\n\nLooking at the file events, powershell.exe creates a file named elemento_logico.txt in a user's downloads folder. Creating files during script execution can be normal, but without knowing what's inside, it could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is that net.exe and net1.exe are called again with localgroup arguments, possibly trying to access or modify group policies.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost.exe is often associated with remote desktop services, but modifying the registry without proper authorization might indicate tampering.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts that interact with system commands, changes to user accounts and groups, credential dumping attempts, and file creation in user directories. These activities are red flags because they don't seem to be part of normal user or admin activity. The repeated use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe is particularly concerning as it points towards potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these events suggests a possible security incident where an attacker might be attempting to compromise the system by gathering information, creating backdoors, or moving laterally within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution with potentially malicious scripts, user account management changes, credential dumping attempts, and file creation in user directories. These events collectively suggest potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first line shows \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" setting a registry value. That's pretty common because Runtime Broker handles user runtime accounts in Windows, so it's probably just normal activity.\n\nNext up is PowerShell setting a registry value. That could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can execute malicious commands. But sometimes legitimate scripts also use it, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen there's another PowerShell event where it accessed something, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's normal or not. Maybe it's part of a script running in the background.\n\nThe fourth entry is \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so this looks like standard logging activity. No red flags here.\n\nNotepad setting a registry value—Notepad is a simple text editor and shouldn't be modifying system settings. That seems odd. Maybe someone was using it to execute some commands or there's a script involved? I need to keep that in mind.\n\nAnother PowerShell access event. This repetition might indicate that PowerShell is being used for multiple actions, which could mean something malicious like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within the network.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—Calculator usually doesn't interact with system files like that. Urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs, but seeing it loaded by Calculator could be a sign of tampering or a malware payload.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe setting registry values twice. SvcHost runs various services, and sometimes malicious processes can hide under this name. Two events here might indicate something unusual happening with the service controls.\n\nAnother Calculator loading urlmon.dll—this reinforces the idea that maybe some process is being used to load unauthorized code or modules.\n\nPowershell access again—so several access events in a row from PowerShell might mean it's executing commands, possibly over time, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nWhoami.exe running with its command line. Whoami is usually harmless; it just reports user information. But seeing it here makes me think if it was executed in the context of other suspicious processes like PowerShell.\n\nAnother Powershell access event—so now that's at least five times. That could be a script looping or something automating tasks, which might not always be bad, but combined with the registry writes and file creations, it's concerning.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of PowerShell accessing resources, Registry modifications by several processes including Notepad, Calculator loading system DLLs, and repeated events from svchost. These could indicate scripting or command execution, possibly part of a malicious payload or an attacker establishing persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because there's enough unusual activity across different processes that could point to malicious behavior, even though some might be legitimate. The volume and combination make it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from PowerShell accessing resources, registry modifications by several processes including Notepad, Calculator loading system DLLs, and repeated events from svchost.exe.
