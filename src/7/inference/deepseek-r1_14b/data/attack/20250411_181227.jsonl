{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and my task is to analyze all of them together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nStarting with the first few events, I notice that multiple entries have 'powershell.exe' as the process name. The command lines look suspicious because they involve creating scheduled tasks using PowerShell commands. Specifically, each command is trying to register a new task with parameters like \"New-ScheduledTaskAction\" and \"Register-ScheduledTask\". The actions are set to execute 'calc.exe', which is typically harmless on its own, but the fact that it's being scheduled at logon and run under the Administrators group with highest privileges raises red flags. This could be a persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain access.\n\nLooking further, I see several events where PowerShell is accessing registry values or creating processes. The 'RegistryEvent' and 'ProcessAccess' tasks indicate that there are changes being made in the system's registry, which could be part of installing or configuring malicious software. Additionally, there are events where images (DLLs) are being loaded by powershell.exe. This might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but certain DLLs could be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nNotably, some entries don't have command lines, only process names, which makes it harder to assess their exact purpose. However, the repetitive pattern of creating scheduled tasks with similar commands is concerning. It suggests a possible attempt to create multiple backdoors or persistence points, each with slightly different task names (like 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc.). This kind of activity isn't typical for legitimate use and is often seen in attacks where attackers want to ensure they can regain access even if one method is detected.\n\nAnother point to consider is the consistency across events. They all seem related to PowerShell executing specific commands, which aligns with common attack vectors. The use of elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) further indicates that these actions could lead to system-wide changes or persistence, making them more severe.\n\nIn contrast, there are a couple of entries from 'chrome.exe' and other processes loading images, but these don't seem unusual on their own. They're likely just normal activity from those applications.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with potentially malicious intent is concerning. Even if each task individually doesn't do something immediately harmful, the pattern suggests a possible attack or malicious configuration. Therefore, these events are definitely worth investigating to ensure there's no underlying breach or compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events indicates potential malicious activity involving PowerShell creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, suggesting an attempted persistence mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity**: Multiple entries show 'powershell.exe' executing commands to create scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments**: The commands are designed to execute 'calc.exe', which, while benign on its own, is often used in attacks for lateral movement or persistence.\n\n3. **Note Privilege Level**: Each task runs under the Administrators group with highest privileges, indicating an attempt to maintain elevated access.\n\n4. **Check Repetitive Patterns**: The creation of multiple tasks with similar commands but different names suggests a method to ensure persistent access despite detection.\n\n5. **Assess Image Loads and Registry Access**: Additional events show PowerShell loading various DLLs and accessing the registry, which could be part of installing malicious components.\n\n6. **Determine Relevance Against Baseline**: Such activities deviate from normal user behavior and are indicative of potential attack vectors like persistence or credential dumping.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese events are indicative of a possible security incident involving unauthorized system access and persistence mechanisms. Immediate investigation is recommended to assess the extent of compromise and remediate any threats identified."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice several PowerShell.exe processes. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities. The first few entries show ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete events related to temp files. This could indicate script execution being tested or dropped.\n\nThen there are instances where PowerShell is used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Specifically, the commands register tasks named \"estrutura_auxiliar\" and \"unidade_comum\", which execute calc.exe at logon as Administrators with highest privileges. That's concerning because it suggests persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation, typical of malware.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent entries from chrome.exe. While unusual for Chrome to modify the registry extensively, especially in this context, it could be part of a broader attack vector or just noise. However, combined with the PowerShell activity, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nLastly, there's a series of events labeled \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This is another red flag as it often indicates unauthorized remote access or command execution, possibly from an attacker trying to control the system remotely.\n\nPutting all these together—PowerShell activities creating malicious scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and remote command executions—it strongly suggests potential malicious behavior. The combination of these events makes the batch highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including creation of malicious scheduled tasks and multiple attempts to execute remote commands, indicating potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. I know that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and it's usually legitimate, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common process used by many services, but repeated registry writes could be a red flag if they're unusual for the system.\n\nThen, another svchost event creates a file at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. The path looks suspicious because it's in the System32 directory and the filename 'unidade_comum' translates to \"common unit\" in Portuguese. That seems odd; maybe malware trying to create a new task.\n\nLooking further, there are two events where an external process (like powershell.exe) is executing remote commands. This could be a sign of command-line abuse, which might indicate malicious activity, especially if these commands aren't part of normal operations.\n\nPowershell creating files in user directories stands out too. Powershell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The file paths like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...' seem unusual unless the user runs scripts there regularly.\n\nThere are also multiple registry writes from conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Chrome loading DLLs is normal, but repeated registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nI notice that some events involve file creations in the Downloads folder, like 'entrada_principal.txt' and 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. These files might be dropped by malicious scripts or tools, especially if their naming doesn't make sense or follows a pattern.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple process creations with powershell and svchost, registry modifications, file writes in user directories, and network queries from chrome. This combination suggests potential malicious activity, possibly related to script execution or persistence mechanisms. The confidence level is high because several indicators point towards possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as remote command execution, file creation in user directories by PowerShell, and repeated registry modifications which may suggest malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
