{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. The first few entries are from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal because Chrome often connects to servers and makes DNS requests. Nothing too suspicious there yet.\n\nThen, starting around the 7th event, I see entries from 'powershell.exe'. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities. The command line in these events shows powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories.\n\nLooking at the details:\n- One event has powershell.exe downloading LICENSE.txt to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp.\n- There are multiple similar events where powershell.exe is downloading different files with names like entrada_comum.txt, unidade_ativo.txt, etc., all saved into temporary folders.\n\nI also notice that after downloading these files, there's a file creation and then deletion event. This might be an attempt to clean up traces of the download or execute the script immediately before it gets deleted, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is that the GitHub repositories mentioned (like raw.githubusercontent.com) are being accessed. I should check if these repositories are known for distributing malicious content. If they're part of a supply chain attack or if these files contain malicious scripts, that would be concerning.\n\nFurthermore, the process events related to PowerShell include tasks like Registry value set and Image loaded. These could indicate that the script is attempting to modify system configurations or load additional modules, which might be signs of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions like Chrome's network traffic aren't alarming, the repeated use of powershell.exe to download files from various GitHub repos into temporary directories is a red flag. The combination of multiple file downloads, execution without clear purpose, and cleanup steps suggests potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events are PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different repositories. This might be suspicious because downloading files from unknown sources can indicate malicious activity, like script downloads or payload drops.\n\nThen there's a series of events from chrome.exe making multiple registry changes. While Chrome does make registry updates during normal operation, the number here is quite high—seven events. Unusual registry access could be an indicator of potential tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nA few more PowerShell events follow: one creates a file in the user's Downloads folder, another touches a startup profile data file, and others modify the registry. These actions don't look standard for normal PowerShell usage and might suggest script execution or configuration changes.\n\nThere are also events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. While this is expected behavior for log shipping tools, the path mentioned (.winlogbeat.yml.new) could be part of a configuration process, but it's worth noting.\n\nAn MpDefenderCoreService.exe event shows a network connection being detected. This might just be Windows Defender updating, but sometimes attackers can abuse legitimate processes for lateral movement.\n\nOther events involve conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes, which are less common and could indicate script execution or persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads, unusual file creations, excessive Chrome registry writes, and network activity from defender services raises red flags. These patterns don't align with typical user behavior and could be signs of a malicious campaign, such as downloading scripts, establishing persistence, and evading detection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub, registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and network activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. So first, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or red flags.\n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are common system files. Then there's svchost.exe setting registry values a few times. Svchost is a legitimate process, often used by services, so that might not be suspicious on its own unless it's doing something unusual. \n\nNext, Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll. That could be normal too since some executables might need to use URL-related functions. Then more svchost.exe registry activity, which I'm still keeping an eye on but not sure yet.\n\nPowershell.exe is next. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a point of interest. The command line isn't provided, so I can't tell what it did. But just running powershell without any flags might not be suspicious.\n\nWhoami.exe is run with its default command line. That's a common tool to check user information, so unless there's something odd about the context, that's probably fine.\n\nThen another powershell process access. Still, no command line info, but multiple instances of powershell running could indicate scripting or malicious activity.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe command deleting a task with SCHTASKS. That stands out because it's removing a scheduled task. If this is happening without proper authorization, it might be part of an attack to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen more registry deletions via cmd and reg.exe. Specifically targeting the Run key in the user hive suggests someone is trying to clean up traces of their activities, possibly to avoid detection by removing startup entries or malicious software.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of activity around the Registry—multiple writes and deletes across different processes like svchost, cmd, reg.exe. This could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or remove evidence. The use of powershell and cmd with commands that delete tasks and registry entries might be part of a larger script aiming to maintain persistence or erase traces.\n\nAlso, the repeated process creations and accesses for known tools like whoami and powershell, along with deletion activities, could be signs of post-exploitation activities where an attacker is trying to cover their tracks or establish long-term access.\n\nI'm considering whether these actions are within normal user activity. Deleting scheduled tasks or registry entries without a clear reason might not be usual for regular users. Additionally, the combination of multiple tools (cmd, powershell, schtasks, reg.exe) being used could point towards automated scripts or attacker tools trying to achieve persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or user information, it's hard to definitively say if these actions are malicious. But the clustering around system configuration changes and process creation\/deletion seems concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving registry modifications and deletions, including use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to delete scheduled tasks and registry entries. This suggests potential malicious activity aimed at removing traces or establishing persistence.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few lines are all related to powershell.exe. The tasks involve 'Process accessed' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. That doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but I know that PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has so many capabilities. So repeated access might be something to look into.\n\nThen there are multiple events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle', again with powershell.exe. This makes me think about what these providers are doing. Maybe they're loading modules or extensions, which could be normal but sometimes attackers use them for persistence.\n\nLooking further down, I see a process access event followed by a registry value set. That's interesting because modifying the registry can indicate configuration changes, maybe setting up startup scripts or altering system settings to maintain access.\n\nThere are several 'Image loaded' events from powershell.exe, pointing to various DLLs. The paths seem normal at first glance—system32 and framework directories—but I should check if these are legitimate or if any are being loaded abnormally.\n\nA file creation event appears for a PowerShell script in the temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then, just after creating it, the same file is deleted. That's odd because why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe to test permissions or as part of some cleanup routine, but it could also be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother event logs the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log management. That doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple 'Engine Lifecycle' events for powershell.exe and 'Pipe Created', which suggests that PowerShell might be interacting with some pipes, possibly for communication between processes or remote commands. Pipes can be a vector for attacks if not properly secured.\n\nLastly, there's a process access event on conhost.exe and another registry set event. Conhost is often associated with command-line interfaces, so maybe it's just being used normally here, but again, in the context of multiple PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger script or attack chain.\n\nPutting this all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe, combined actions like creating and deleting scripts, registry modifications, and pipe creations raise some eyebrows. While each event might not be malicious on its own, the pattern looks like potential lateral movement or persistence techniques used by attackers. The confidence is high because multiple indicators point towards possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including file creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the temp directory, registry modifications, and pipe creations, suggest potential malicious activities such as persistence or lateral movement.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few lines are about processes being created or accessed. There's a whoami.exe running, which is usually just a command used to identify the user, so that doesn't seem too suspicious on its own. Then there's cmd.exe being executed with some parameters—also pretty common for various system tasks.\n\nI notice a lot of powershell.exe entries, which immediately raises my antenna because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious commands. The events show powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, which could be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. There are several instances where powershell.exe sets registry values, which might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or create persistent keys.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line parameter \"& {}\" in some of the powershell.exe entries. That syntax is often used to pass arguments to scripts or commands in PowerShell, and sometimes it's a way to execute malicious code without being too obvious. Also, the repeated use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might be related to how PowerShell initializes modules or loads libraries.\n\nAnother red flag is the creation and deletion of a file in the temporary directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\". Temporary files created by scripts can indicate that some code was run, possibly for testing or malicious purposes. The fact that it's deleted shortly after might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nI also see several ImageLoad events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs. This could be normal operation, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries or use these modules to execute code. Additionally, the process command lines show different ways powershell.exe is invoked, which might be part of a script execution chain.\n\nThe high frequency of powershell.exe activity across multiple events makes me suspicious. Attackers often abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for their activities because they're commonly allowed and don't always trigger alarms. The combination of creating, accessing, and modifying registry entries, loading images, and file operations points towards potential malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence or executing commands.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern here looks concerning. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe with potentially suspicious command lines and actions that could be indicative of attack techniques like process injection, script execution, and persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe show suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and potential use of command-line parameters for malicious purposes.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from Calculator.exe and chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying the registry. That seems a bit unusual because those aren't typically known for such activities. But I'm not sure yet if that's malicious or just some legitimate behavior I'm not aware of.\n\nThen, I notice multiple events from powershell.exe doing various things like creating pipes, accessing processes, and setting registry values. Powershell is a common tool for both sysadmins and attackers, so the presence here could be either normal admin work or signs of malicious activity. The command lines in some of these events look suspicious. For example, there's a command line that tries to remove a file in the TEMP directory: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". That seems like an attempt to delete a potentially malicious file, which might be part of a cleanup routine by malware.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell is accessing other processes and loading various .dll files. Some of these DLLs are from the Windows system directory and .NET framework, which isn't inherently bad, but when combined with other activities, it could indicate that Powershell is executing scripts or commands that aren't typical.\n\nAnother red flag is the process named 'whoami.exe' being executed, which might be used to gather user information. If this is part of a larger script run by Powershell, it could be trying to identify the current user or system info for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications and file creations in different locations (like the Startup folder) are concerning. Attackers often use the registry to persistence their malware so it runs on each startup. The fact that multiple processes are making these changes adds to the suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, the high number of RegistryEvent tasks in the logs from various processes suggests a pattern of unauthorized modifications. Legitimate software usually doesn't make such frequent changes unless it's part of system updates or specific configurations, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of Powershell activities (including deletions and process access), the use of 'whoami.exe', and multiple registry changes across different processes points towards potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all involve powershell.exe doing various things like loading images, creating files, deleting them, and accessing processes. Specifically, I notice a lot of file deletions in the TEMP directory. For example, there are multiple entries where powershell is removing items from %TEMP%, such as tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. This pattern of repeatedly deleting files from the temp folder could be suspicious because attackers often clean up after themselves to erase traces of their activity.\n\nThen, I see that some events involve chrome.exe and conhost.exe accessing registry values and loading DLLs. While these are legitimate processes, the combination with powershell's activities might raise an eyebrow. There's also a whoami.exe execution, which is typically used to check user permissions but can be part of reconnaissance by malicious actors.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event where powershell creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could indicate that some configuration or script is being stored there, possibly for persistence across reboots or sessions. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might suggest an attempt to modify system configurations, which could be malicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a sequence of actions that might be part of a larger campaign. The use of powershell for file deletions and potential registry modifications is common in attack scenarios because it's often used for lateral movement and persistence. The specific files being deleted are named with terms like \"tarefa_base\" which translates to \"base task\" or similar, suggesting some structured process that might be part of a script.\n\nAnother point is the repeated nature of these deletions. While a user could be cleaning up their own temp files, it's less common for legitimate scripts to delete so many specific files unless they're part of an automated cleanup routine. However, attackers often use such actions to remove evidence or disable security mechanisms temporarily.\n\nI also note that some events have 'None' in the file path, which might indicate that no file was accessed during those operations, but other fields like command_line show explicit deletions and process creations. The combination of ImageLoad events for Defender-related DLLs might be an attempt to check if antivirus or security software is present.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities could be indicative of a potential attack. The use of powershell for multiple file deletions in the temp directory, combined with registry modifications, suggests possible malicious behavior like evidence wiping or persistence setup.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here, which immediately makes me cautious because it's often used in cyberattacks. The user is executing multiple commands that delete files from the TEMP directory. That could be suspicious—maybe they're trying to remove traces of something malicious.\n\nLooking at the logs, there are several instances where PowerShell is being called with specific commands. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\" and similar lines. Using Remove-Item to delete files and ignoring errors suggests they don't want any interruptions or logs from these deletions.\n\nAlso, I notice the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\". Temporary scripts can be a red flag because attackers might use them to execute malicious code that isn't directly visible in other places.\n\nAnother point is the process creations. The first event shows \"powershell.exe\" being launched, and then subsequent events show it accessing various files and registry entries. This kind of activity can indicate script execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThere are also file creation events for .yml files related to winlogbeat, which seems normal unless it's part of some data collection process. But more concerning is the repeated use of PowerShell with specific deletion commands.\n\nI'm also seeing other processes like conhost.exe and whoami.exe being created. While these aren't inherently malicious, their presence alongside a lot of PowerShell activity could indicate they're being used as part of a larger script or attack chain.\n\nThe logon events show a user named fiddelis creating these files and executing commands. If this user is legitimate, it might just be them performing routine tasks, but if not, it's a sign of potential compromise.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with file deletions, temporary script creations, and other process activities raises concerns about possible malicious behavior. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some of these actions could be part of legitimate system administration tasks. However, the repetitive pattern and specific commands make me lean towards it being interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with file deletions in TEMP directory and creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": 75\n}\n```"}

My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nStarting with the first few entries, I see multiple instances where 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values. This happens seven times. Then there's a switch to 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which also does a registry set. After that, we have several events involving 'powershell.exe'. Some of these are 'Process accessed' events, and others involve creating processes like 'whoami.exe'. Notably, 'whoami.exe' is being run from the system32 directory multiple times. \n\nThen there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in its own data directory, which seems normal for that tool. Finally, 'powershell.exe' creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in a user's downloads folder.\n\nNow, looking at these events collectively, I need to assess if they indicate any malicious behavior. \n\nFirstly, multiple registry writes by Chrome and other processes aren't unusual since many applications interact with the Windows Registry for configuration. The repeated process creations of 'whoami.exe' might seem suspicious at first glance because it's a common tool used in privilege escalation attacks when run from certain paths. However, in this case, 'whoami.exe' is being executed directly from system32, which is legitimate as it's part of Windows.\n\nThe activity with PowerShell is more concerning. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script downloading. The 'ProcessAccess' events might indicate lateral movement or data gathering. However, without evidence of actual malicious commands or file drops beyond the creation of 'pacote_ativo.txt', which doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are elements that could raise flags—like PowerShell activity and repeated process creations—the lack of overtly malicious actions makes me lean towards this not being an active attack. It might just be normal user activity or script execution. \n\nI'm 75% confident in this assessment because some of the indicators (like multiple registry writes and PowerShell use) are common in both legitimate and malicious activities, but without additional context like unusual file hashes, network connections, or known bad actor behaviors, it's hard to confirm an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of registry modifications by Chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, as well as repeated ProcessCreate events for whoami.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
