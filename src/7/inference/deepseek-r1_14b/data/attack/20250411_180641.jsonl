{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first four entries, they're all from chrome.exe with a network connection detected. That seems normal since Chrome handles multiple connections regularly. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe being accessed twice. PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also often abused in attacks. The fact that it's being accessed without any obvious context could raise an eyebrow, but maybe it's just a script running.\n\nThen there are entries for whoami.exe and cmd.exe with command lines. whoami.exe alone isn't malicious, but using cmd.exe to execute other files might be part of some automated process or script. The command line in cmd.exe is obfuscated, which is a red flag because attackers often hide their commands.\n\nAfter that, there are multiple entries where various .exe files are being created and executed in the Temp directory. Creating executables in temp folders can be part of legitimate software operations, but it's also a common tactic for malware to drop malicious files there. The fact that these files have names like \"pacote_logico.exe\" or \"registro_ativo.exe\" doesn't immediately ring a bell, but the frequency and combination with other events might indicate something is off.\n\nI notice several ImageLoad events for various .dll files related to the .NET framework. These are legitimate system processes, so they're probably not suspicious on their own. However, when combined with the other activities, it could be part of a larger script or process injection attempt.\n\nThere's also a ProcessTerminate event for elemento_ativo.exe, which just means some process was closed. Without context, that's hard to judge, but if this process was created earlier and then terminated, it might not be an issue unless there's a pattern.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell accesses, cmd.exe with obfuscated commands, creation of numerous executables in the Temp directory, and various file and registry activities. These behaviors collectively could indicate potential malicious activity, such as script injection, lateral movement, or payload deployment. The combination suggests that an attacker might be using legitimate tools (like PowerShell and cmd) to execute malicious scripts or payloads, possibly attempting persistence by modifying system files or registry entries.\n\nWhile some of these actions alone aren't conclusive, the overall pattern raises concerns. It's possible that this could be part of a larger campaign or attack vector, making it worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell and cmd.exe with potentially obfuscated commands, the creation of numerous executable files in the Temp directory, and several registry modifications. These activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior or script execution, making further investigation warranted.\",\n  \"RISK_LEVEL\": \"High\",\n  \"RECOMMENDATION\": \"Investigate the origin and purpose of these processes, especially focusing on the obfuscated commands and newly created executables in the Temp directory.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process, often used by services, but repeated writes to the registry could be suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal operation. However, it's also common for system processes to make such changes.\n\nNext, 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll stands out. While Calculator is a benign app, loading unusual DLLs might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. This event appears more than once, which could be concerning.\n\nThen there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' accessing the registry. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for execution and lateral movement. Registry access alone isn't suspicious, but combined with other actions, it could signal malicious activity.\n\nThe numerous 'chrome.exe' events, especially multiple writes to the registry and loading of system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are worth noting. While Chrome is legitimate, excessive registry changes might suggest unauthorized behavior or potential adware\/malware activity.\n\nAdditionally, 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files in its own directory isn't inherently suspicious, but it's something to keep an eye on, especially if there are other signs of compromise.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, while each individual event could be benign, the volume and combination—especially involving multiple processes accessing registry values and loading DLLs—raise flags. These patterns might indicate a potential attack vector or persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, loading of non-standard DLLs by Calculator.exe and chrome.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
