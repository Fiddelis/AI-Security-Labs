{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. PowerShell is a common tool for admins but can also be abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's appearing several times makes me cautious.\n\nLooking at the events, there are instances where powershell.exe is accessing files, like creating temporary files (objeto_temporario.txt) and configuration files for winlogbeat. This could indicate script activity, which might be malicious if it's part of a larger campaign.\n\nThen there are other processes like cmd.exe being used with command-line arguments to create notepad.exe via wmic process call. Using WMIC in this way is often a red flag because attackers use it to execute commands without writing files directly to the disk, making them harder to detect.\n\nI also notice several registry value sets across different processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe). Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation tactics. This combined with image loading events from WMIC.exe into system32 DLLs could be an attempt to load malicious components.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process creating notepad.exe, which seems benign on its own but when combined with other suspicious activities might suggest a broader compromise.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell and cmd usage with potential command execution, file creation in user directories, and registry modifications. These could be indicators of malicious activity, such as lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe usage with potentially malicious command-line arguments, including wmic process calls to create notepad.exe. There are also registry modifications and file creations in user directories, which may indicate malicious activity such as lateral movement or persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
