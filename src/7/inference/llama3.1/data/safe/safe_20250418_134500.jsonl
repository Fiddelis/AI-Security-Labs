{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This log data appears to be from a Windows system and contains events generated by various processes and services. Here's a breakdown of the different types of events:\n\n1. **Process creation**: Events with `processCreate` as the event type indicate that a new process has been created on the system.\n\n   Example:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"}}\n   ```\n\n2. **Registry modifications**: These events represent changes made to the Windows registry by processes or services.\n\n   Example:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"RuntimeBroker.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"}}\n   ```\n\n3. **File system activity**: Events with `fileCreate` as the event type indicate that a new file has been created on the system, while events with `fileAccess` may suggest file reading or writing operations.\n\n   Examples:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":null,\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Logs\\\\WindowsUpdate\\\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.6.etl\"}}\n   \n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\logs\\\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson\"}}\n   ```\n\n4. **Network activity**: Events with `networkConnect` as the event type indicate that a network connection has been established.\n\n   Example:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)\"}}\n   ```\n\n5. **Process termination**: These events suggest that processes have terminated unexpectedly or normally, depending on the context.\n\n   Examples:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process terminated (rule: ProcessTerminate)\"}}\n\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\"}}\n   ```\n\n6. **Image loading**: Events with `imageLoad` as the event type indicate that a process has loaded an image, which could be a library or another executable.\n\n   Examples:\n   ```\n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"}}\n   \n   {\"process\":{\"name\":\"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\"}}\n   ```\n\n7. **PowerShell execution**: The presence of `powershell.exe` in the logs suggests that PowerShell was executed on the system.\n\nThis analysis provides a high-level overview of the activities taking place on the Windows system during the time period covered by these logs."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log of Windows events collected by Winlogbeat, a tool for collecting and forwarding Windows event logs to Elasticsearch or other systems. Here's a breakdown of the log:\n\n**Event Types**\n\nThe log contains several types of events, including:\n\n* Process Create: Events related to process creation, such as when a new process is launched.\n* File Created: Events related to file creation, such as when a new file is created on disk.\n* Registry Event: Events related to registry modifications, such as when a registry value is changed.\n* DNS Query: Events related to DNS queries, such as when a system resolves a hostname to an IP address.\n\n**Common Fields**\n\nThe log has several common fields that appear throughout the events:\n\n* `process`: The name of the process associated with the event (e.g. \"svchost.exe\").\n* `winlog.task`: The type of event or task being performed (e.g. \"File created\", \"Process Create\", etc.).\n* `file.path`: The path to a file associated with the event.\n\n**Interesting Events**\n\nSome events stand out as potentially interesting:\n\n* A process named \"notepad.exe\" is launched, but its command line includes an extra quote at the end (e.g. `\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\notepad.exe\\\" \"). This might be indicative of some unusual behavior or malware.\n* A file named `setup.exe` is created in a Microsoft Edge Update directory, which could indicate that the system is installing a software update for Microsoft Edge.\n* A registry value is set by a process named \"Explorer.EXE\", which could be related to changes made by the Windows operating system.\n\n**Potential Issues**\n\nSome events might indicate potential issues or security concerns:\n\n* The event logs show multiple attempts to create files with names like `EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp` in the Microsoft Edge Update directory. This could be indicative of malware or unusual behavior.\n* A file named `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl` is created, which might indicate that Windows Update is attempting to write logs to disk.\n\nOverall, this log provides a wealth of information about system events and processes running on the machine. It's up to the analyst or user to interpret these events and determine if they represent normal behavior or potential security concerns."}
