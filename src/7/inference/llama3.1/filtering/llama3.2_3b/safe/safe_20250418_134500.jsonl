Review the system's service management and ensure that only necessary services are running.\n2. Investigate the files created in the `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache` directory to determine their purpose and legitimacy.\n3. Run a full system scan with an anti-virus tool to detect any potential malware or ransomware infections.\n\nPlease note that these are general observations, and further analysis may be required to fully understand the context of these logs."}
