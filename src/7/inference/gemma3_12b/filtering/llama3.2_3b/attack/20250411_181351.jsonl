While each save has a different file name, the pattern strongly suggests reconnaissance activity or potential remote access tool (RAT) behavior. The use of `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms` and screen capture capabilities is a key indicator. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' winlog tasks further support that these processes are being managed, potentially by a larger framework.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
