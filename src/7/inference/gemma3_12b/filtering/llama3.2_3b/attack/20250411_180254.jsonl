The repeated registry queries and PowerShell activity are concerning. The presence of `MpOAV.dll` being loaded by `systeminfo.exe` is unexpected. The creation of a file (`objeto_padrao.txt`) by PowerShell warrants further investigation. Multiple Chrome registry modifications are also present, though common, they contribute to overall suspicion. Finally, the `Special Logon` event indicates possible unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
