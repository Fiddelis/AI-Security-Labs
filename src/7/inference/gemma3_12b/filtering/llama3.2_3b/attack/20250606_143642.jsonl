{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This looks like a detailed log of a potentially malicious PowerShell script execution. Let's break it down and highlight the key points:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nThe script appears to be designed to evade detection by manipulating the PowerShell execution policy, deleting temporary files, and potentially modifying registry settings.  It's a classic attempt to blend in with legitimate PowerShell activity while performing potentially harmful actions. The \"Final result: 1\" suggests the attacker wanted to confirm that something was executed successfully.\n\n**Key Observations & Analysis:**\n\n* **PowerShell Scripting:**  The entire log is centered around `powershell.exe`, indicating malicious PowerShell script execution.\n* **Execution Policy Bypass:** `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted` shows an attempt to execute a script even when restricted by the PowerShell execution policy.  This is a common tactic to bypass security measures.\n* **File Deletion:** `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` indicates the script is deleting a potentially large file (`entrada_principal.zip`) from the user's temporary folder.  This is likely an attempt to remove evidence of the initial download or setup of the malware.\n* **File Creation:** The creation of the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file within the PowerShell startup directory suggests the attacker is setting up persistence, potentially to run the script automatically when the user logs in.\n* **Registry Modification:**  The `Registry value set` indicates that the attacker made changes to the registry, meaning they modified the settings to benefit their operations.  What they modified is unknown from this log.\n* **Image Loading (DLLs):** The script loads several Microsoft DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll). This is a normal part of PowerShell execution but also a way for malicious scripts to hide within legitimate processes.\n* **Defender DLL Load:** The script loads `MpClient.dll`, a component of Windows Defender.  This could be for either legitimate or malicious purposes. A malicious actor could be attempting to leverage Defender's functionality or simply trying to blend in with Defender processes.\n* **Final Result:** The \"Final result: 1\" indicates the attacker wanted to confirm that something was executed successfully.\n\n**What's Missing & What to Investigate Further:**\n\n* **Content of the Executed Script:**  The log doesn't show the actual content of the PowerShell script. This is critical to understand the full scope of the attack.\n* **Source of the Script:**  Where did the script originate? An email attachment? A downloaded file?  Knowing the source is essential for identifying the initial infection vector.\n* **Specific Registry Key Modification:** Determining exactly which registry key was modified is critical.\n* **`entrada_principal.zip` Contents:**  What was in that zip file?  That will provide clues as to the malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.\n2. **Full System Scan:** Perform a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/anti-malware solution.\n3. **Forensic Analysis:**  Engage a cybersecurity professional to conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system.\n4. **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Tighten PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n5. **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement PowerShell auditing and monitoring to detect suspicious activity.\n6. **Patch Systems:**  Ensure all systems are fully patched with the latest security updates.\n7. **Employee Training:**  Educate employees about phishing and other social engineering tactics.\n\n\n\nThis is a clear indication of a potential malware infection. It requires immediate and thorough investigation and remediation.  The steps above will help to contain the threat and prevent future attacks."}
