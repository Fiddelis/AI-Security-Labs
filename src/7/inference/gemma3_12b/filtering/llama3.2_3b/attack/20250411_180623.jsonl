This pattern suggests potential script execution or reconnaissance activity. While the deletion of the script mitigates some concern, the preceding activity warrants further investigation. Additionally, the creation of a new .winlogbeat.yml file also raises a minor flag as it might indicate tampering or configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
