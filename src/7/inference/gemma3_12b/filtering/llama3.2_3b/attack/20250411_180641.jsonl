The executables are named with generic terms like 'pacote', 'registro', 'modulo' and 'tarefa', and they appear to be dynamically compiled and executed. The presence of `powershell.exe` being involved alongside these compiled files, along with registry modifications, and unusual process names suggests a potential scripting or malware execution chain. The `winlogbeat` event may be unrelated, but warrants review in context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
