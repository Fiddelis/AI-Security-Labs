Multiple instances of `bash.exe` are creating pipes and accessing processes, which is unusual and could indicate malicious activity (e.g., shell manipulation).  `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` is common but should be monitored as part of Defender evasion attempts. The repeated registry events involving `svchost.exe` also merits scrutiny.
