The file paths involved are obfuscated (e.g., containing terms like 'elemento_padrao', 'objeto_secundario'), which is often a tactic employed by malicious actors.  The `Archive.psm1` being referenced also supports this concern. The repetition of the `Compress-Archive` command strongly suggests potential data exfiltration or preparation for further actions.
