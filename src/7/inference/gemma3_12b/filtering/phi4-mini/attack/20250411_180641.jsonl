The command lines for `csc.exe` indicate potentially malicious code compilation, likely involving staged compilation and execution. The compilation paths are unusual, leveraging the temp directory and seemingly building components dynamically. There's also process interaction (`modulo_secundario.exe` loading `mscoree.dll`), common in malware. The presence of `powershell.exe` accesses and registry modifications strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent. Finally, the creation of a new Winlogbeat configuration file is also unusual and warrants review.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
