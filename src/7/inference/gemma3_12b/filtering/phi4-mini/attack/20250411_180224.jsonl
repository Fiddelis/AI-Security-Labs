The scheduled tasks are configured to run daily with a PowerShell script being executed via the task scheduler, referencing non-existent script files (`objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`). This suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or execute code, even if the script file doesn't exist, leading to errors that may be suppressed. The activity is also coupled with registry and file creation events by `svchost.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`, which warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
