While registry modifications are common, the volume of these events, along with ImageLoad events involving urlmon.dll and the presence of special logons, warrants investigation for potential malicious activity. The multiple instances of DrvInst.exe modifying registry keys is unusual and requires closer inspection.  Winlogbeat installation and configuration also stands out.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
