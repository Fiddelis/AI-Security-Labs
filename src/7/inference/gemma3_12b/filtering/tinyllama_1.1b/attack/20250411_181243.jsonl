The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script (likely to bypass script policy checks) further strengthens the suspicion of malicious activity. Multiple DLLs being loaded by Powershell also raises concerns, although not definitive, when considering with the other activity. The usage of 'net1.exe' is also of note.
