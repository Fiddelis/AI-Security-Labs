The presence of powershell.exe creating a file ('objeto_padrao.txt') and reg.exe querying the registry suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious script execution. The loading of amsi.dll by both systeminfo.exe and chrome.exe could indicate attempts to evade detection. The repeated registry modifications and file creations by various processes amplify concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
