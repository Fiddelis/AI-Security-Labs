The use of `net1.exe` for user management is highly unusual and indicative of potential unauthorized privilege escalation or account compromise. Furthermore, the PowerShell execution and file creation events warrant closer inspection. The 'modulo_logico_Admin' and 'unidade_comum_Admin' names raise concerns regarding potential naming conventions employed by attackers.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
