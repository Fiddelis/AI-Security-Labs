The use of `powershell.exe` and frequent registry modifications further suggest potentially automated actions. Additionally, the loading of `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` within the context of `systeminfo.exe` warrants closer inspection, as they relate to anti-malware technologies, and attackers may attempt to bypass or disable them.
