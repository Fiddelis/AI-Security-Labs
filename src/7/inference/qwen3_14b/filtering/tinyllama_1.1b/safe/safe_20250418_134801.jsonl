The first thing I notice is the first event involving MicrosoftEdge with a file creation time changed. The file path is in the EdgeUpdate directory, which might be normal, but the name EDGEMITMP_F12CA.tmp sounds temporary. However, that's common during installations.\n\nThen there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe not suspicious here. The next event is setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThe next several events are about User Account Management. A lot of those entries might be normal system activities, like user logins or account changes. But there are 10 of them, which could indicate some automated process or script running multiple account management tasks. However, without more details, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThen there's services.exe and taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. That's normal. Svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in Delivery Optimization directories. Those are part of Windows Update and Delivery Optimization, so probably legitimate.\n\nThe PowerShell command line is interesting. It's checking INF files for specific patterns. The command is looking for sections that might relate to default installations on different architectures. This could be part of a script that's checking for installation configurations. But why would someone run this? Maybe part of a setup process, but could also be a reconnaissance step for an attacker looking to find installation scripts.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal during setup. The git.exe events are creating files in a node_modules directory. That seems like normal Git operations, maybe cloning a repository or checking out files.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of events are legitimate system processes and normal user activities. The PowerShell script might be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to confirm. The repeated User Account Management events could be a sign of something, but they might just be routine. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected file modifications, unusual process behavior, or network activity. So I'd say this batch isn't interesting enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily represent normal system operations, legitimate software installations (e.g., Edge, Winlogbeat), and standard user activities (e.g., Git operations).

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are about files being created by git.exe in the node_modules\/semver directory. The files are various JavaScript files and some other related files like debug.js, identifiers.js, etc. \n\nHmm, so git.exe is typically used for version control. When you clone a repository or pull changes, git might create files in the node_modules directory if there's a package.json and dependencies are being installed. But wait, in this case, the user is a student, and the path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which might be a course project. \n\nThe files listed are part of the semver package, which is a library for parsing and comparing semantic versioning. These files are standard in a Node.js project's node_modules folder. Since git is the process creating them, it's possible that the user ran a git command that triggered the installation of dependencies, leading to the creation of these files.\n\nBut why are all these files being created? If this is part of a normal git operation, like cloning a repository, then it's expected. However, if the user didn't initiate a git command, or if these files are being created in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the paths again, they all fall under node_modules\/semver, which is a common directory for npm packages. The fact that multiple files are created by git.exe might indicate that git is handling the checkout of a repository that includes these modules. However, git usually doesn't create files in node_modules unless there's a specific setup, like a git submodule or if the repository includes those files. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is using a tool that integrates git with npm, maybe during an install process. But typically, npm handles the installation of node_modules, not git. So maybe this is a case of a malicious actor using git to inject files into the node_modules directory. But without more context, like other suspicious activities or unexpected processes, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe key here is that all events are related to normal file creation during a git operation in a standard project structure. There's no indication of unusual activity, such as unexpected processes, remote connections, or modifications to critical system files. The files are part of a legitimate package, and the process is git.exe, which is a trusted application. \n\nTherefore, unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise, this batch of events seems to be a normal part of a git operation in a development environment. The confidence is moderate because while it's mostly benign, the absence of other suspicious logs makes it less certain, but the pattern is common enough to be considered not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events show standard file creation by git.exe in a typical node_modules\/semver directory structure during a software project workflow.

All the events are about files being created by git.exe in the node_modules directory of a user's project. The files mentioned are typical for npm packagesâ€”like package.json, README.md, index.js, etc. \n\nFirst, I should consider the normal behavior of git.exe. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or pull changes, it creates files as part of the process. The node_modules directory is where npm installs dependencies, so it's common for git to interact with that folder when managing a project.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be part of standard npm package structures. Files like .editorconfig, .eslintrc, .github, and others are common configuration files in development projects. The presence of test directories and files like CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, and test scripts are also typical for open-source packages.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activity. Malicious behavior might involve unexpected file creation, especially in sensitive directories, or files with unusual names. However, in this case, all the files are standard and related to software development. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool, and the actions align with normal git operations.\n\nThere's no indication of unusual activity here. The events are consistent with a user working on a project that involves multiple npm packages. The files created are part of the normal structure of those packages. Unless there's a context suggesting that these files shouldn't be there or that git.exe is being used in an atypical way, these events don't point to a security issue.\n\nConfidence-wise, since all the events are routine and align with expected behavior, the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The justification would be that these are normal git operations creating standard files in a node_modules directory.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal git operations creating standard files in a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm package management.

All the events are about files being created by git.exe in various paths under node_modules.

But the events mention \"File created\" which could be part of a normal installation process.

For example, sshpk has its lib directory with various JS files, which is normal. The same goes for string-width and strip-ansi. The process is git.exe, which is expected if someone is cloning a repository or pulling changes. \n\nBut wait, are there any signs of malicious activity?
