{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The first thing I notice is the use of certutil.exe with the -encode and -decode commands. That's often used for encoding and decoding files, but in this case, it's being used to encode calc.exe, which is a legitimate Windows utility, but the way it's being handled here might be suspicious. The command line shows encoding calc.exe into a temporary file and then decoding another file into an executable. This could be part of a process to obfuscate malicious payloads or exfiltrate data.\n\nNext, there's the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe multiple times. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing commands and scripts. The presence of multiple Process Create events for cmd.exe and PowerShell might indicate an attempt to run scripts or commands that could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the files involved, there's a mention of .yml.new files created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files isn't unusual, but combined with other events, it might be part of setting up logging or data collection that's being manipulated by an attacker.\n\nAnother point is the network connections from chrome.exe. While Chrome itself is a legitimate browser, if it's initiating multiple network connections, especially if they're to suspicious domains, that could be a sign of data exfiltration. However, the logs here don't specify the destination, so that's a bit unclear.\n\nThe presence of SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting. SDXHelper is part of the Windows Search service, but loading urlmon.dll (which is related to Internet Explorer) might be normal, but if it's being done in an unusual context, it could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of encoding\/decoding with certutil, multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes, and potential network activity might indicate a malicious activity. However, some of these events could be benign. The confidence is medium because while there are suspicious elements, they aren't definitive on their own. But when combined, they suggest a possible investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files (potential data exfiltration or payload obfuscation), repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe process creation (common in attacks), and unusual file operations (e.g., .yml.new file creation). These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
