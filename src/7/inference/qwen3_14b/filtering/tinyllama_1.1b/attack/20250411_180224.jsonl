{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first event is a process creation of cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line is a bit complex: it's creating a task named 'win32times' that runs daily, and the trigger is a PowerShell command that bypasses execution policy and runs a script from 'c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The file path here is interesting because the script name is 'NonExistingScript.ps1'â€”that might be a red flag. But wait, the file isn't present, so maybe that's a typo or a misconfiguration. However, the fact that someone is trying to create a scheduled task that runs PowerShell with -ep bypass is suspicious. That's a common technique used in attacks to execute malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for PowerShell.exe. Not sure yet, but combined with the previous event, it could be part of the same activity. Then, there's a Registry value set event for cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Then, multiple events for schtasks.exe, including image loaded from taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, so that's probably normal. The query of the scheduled task 'win32times' is also part of the initial command line, so that's just checking the task.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe with registry changes. That's a bit odd, but maybe not malicious. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file for configuration, which seems legitimate if it's part of a monitoring tool. The whoami.exe process is just checking the user, which is normal. \n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious part is the creation of a scheduled task that runs a non-existent PowerShell script. Even though the script isn't found, the attempt to create such a task with elevated privileges (running as system) and using -ep bypass is a common indicator of compromise. The other events don't seem to tie into this, but the initial event is enough to flag this as interesting. However, the confidence might be around 0.7 because while the scheduled task creation is suspicious, the script not existing could be a mistake, but the method used is still concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a suspicious cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task (win32times) with a PowerShell command that bypasses execution policy and attempts to execute a non-existent script (NonExistingScript.ps1). This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity, such as attempting to establish persistence or execute payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
