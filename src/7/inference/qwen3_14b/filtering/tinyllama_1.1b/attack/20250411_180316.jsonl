So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries with 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' processes. PowerShell is often used in attacks, so that's a red flag. Then, looking at the command lines: one entry has \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Deleting processes can be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern. Another command is \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which deletes a scheduled task. Maybe the attacker is cleaning up after creating a task?\n\nThere's also a 'WMIC.exe' process with a command to delete notepad.exe processes. WMIC is another tool that can be abused. Then, there's an 'Image loaded' event for 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, maybe that's a sign of something else. Also, 'amsi.dll' is loaded by chrome.exe, which is normal, but again, context matters.\n\nLooking at the registry events: multiple 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' events. If a legitimate process is modifying the registry, that's normal, but if there's a lot of activity or from unexpected processes, that's a concern. The 'svchost.exe' and 'conhost.exe' are system processes, but they're appearing frequently here. However, they're not always malicious, but combined with other events, it could be part of an attack.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of 'Process accessed' for powershell.exe. If a process is being accessed multiple times, maybe it's being used to execute commands or inject code. The 'whoami.exe' command is just checking the user, which is normal, but again, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger plan.\n\nSo, putting it all together: there are multiple suspicious processes (powershell, cmd, wmic), commands that delete processes and scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and image loads. These could indicate an attacker trying to manipulate the system, execute commands, and cover their tracks. The combination of these events is more concerning than any single event, so the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe is a legitimate command that shows user information, and chrome.exe is a regular process. The cmd.exe and powershell.exe entries are common, but I notice that several of them are associated with Registry value set events. That's normal for some operations, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe with tasks like Process accessed, Image loaded, and File Delete logged. The Image loaded events point to specific DLLs, like mscoreei.dll and MpOAV.dll. The MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. But the File Delete event deletes a temporary script file, which might be normal cleanup. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events and ProcessAccess events could indicate something unusual.\n\nThen there are several entries with command_line set to \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is an empty script. These might be placeholders or test commands, but repeated instances could be part of a script or automation. Also, the winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file, which is part of log collection, so that's likely benign.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some powershell.exe processes, there are Test-Path commands checking for specific .bat files. The paths mentioned are like \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate directory traversal, which can be a technique used in attacks to access parent directories. However, the Test-Path command itself is a normal PowerShell command, so without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, and file operations might suggest someone is trying to manipulate the system. However, without seeing any malicious payloads or unexpected network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events and ProcessAccess events could be part of normal operations, but the repeated use of PowerShell and the Test-Path commands with directory traversal might be worth investigating further.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious patterns but not definitive evidence of a security incident.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The command lines involve checking if certain files exist and creating or modifying scripts. For example, the first event has a PowerShell command that checks if a specific .bat file exists. Then there's another command that creates a new item and sets content to a .bat file. These actions could be part of normal operations, but the repetition and the paths might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Loaded events for .NET components like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard for PowerShell, so maybe not a red flag on their own. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded might be relevant. But since they're part of legitimate processes, that might not be an issue.\n\nThen there's the File Created event for a StartupProfileData file. That's a common location for PowerShell profiles, so creating a file there could be normal. However, the Registry value set events might indicate changes to the system's registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms if done maliciously.\n\nLooking at the paths in the command lines, there's a pattern with directories like \"modulo_logico\", \"elemento_auxiliar\", and \"componente_secundario_script.bat\". These names don't seem standard; they might be obfuscated or part of a custom naming scheme. Also, the use of \"..\" in the paths could be trying to access parent directories, which might be a way to navigate the file system in a non-standard way.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of similar PowerShell commands. The first event checks for a file's existence, and later there's a command that creates a file and sets its content. If these are part of a script that's being deployed or executed multiple times, that could be suspicious. The combination of file creation, registry modifications, and multiple PowerShell executions might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or modify system behavior.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Some of these events could be part of legitimate software operations. But the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, file creations, and registry changes, along with non-standard file paths, raises enough suspicion to warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the patterns are consistent with what might be seen in an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands are observed creating files (`New-Item`), writing content to `.bat` files (`Set-Content`), and checking for file existence (`Test-Path`). These actions could be part of **script deployment** or **post-exploitation activities**.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     New-Item \"C:\\registro_geral\\...\" -Force | Out-Null\n     Set-Content -Path \"C:\\registro_logico\\...\" -Value \"dir\"\n     ```\n     The use of `-Force` and non-standard paths (e.g., `registro_geral`, `objeto_temporario_script.bat`) suggests **obfuscation** or **custom nomenclature**.\n\n2. **File and Registry Modifications:**\n   - A file is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, a location often used for **PowerShell profiles**. This could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup scripts).\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events may signal **registry manipulation** for persistence or configuration changes.\n\n3. **Unusual File Paths and Parent Directory Navigation:**\n   - Paths like `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\componente_geral\\...` use `..` to traverse directories, which might be an attempt to **hide or obfuscate** the actual target location (e.g., accessing sensitive directories indirectly).\n\n4. **Loaded DLLs and System Components:**\n   - While loading .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoreei.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is normal for PowerShell, repeated references to **Windows Defender components** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) could indicate **interference with security software** or **bypassing detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Interesting:**\n- The combination of **file creation, registry changes, and PowerShell scripting** suggests **potential persistence** or **tool deployment**.\n- The **non-standard file paths and repeated scripting** raise concerns about **obfuscation** or **custom attack tooling**.\n- While no direct malicious payloads are visible, the **frequency and nature of the events** align with **post-exploitation behavior** (e.g., establishing footholds, evading detection).\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check the contents of the created `.bat` files** (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`) to confirm if they contain malicious commands (e.g., `dir`, `powershell`, or other payloads).\n2. **Analyze the registry changes** for signs of persistence (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` or `HKLM` entries).\n3. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process creation) to determine if these actions are linked to external command-and-control (C2) servers or data exfiltration.\n4. **Verify user activity** (e.g., `fiddelis`) for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and merits further investigation. While not conclusive proof of malicious activity, the combination of **PowerShell scripting, file\/registry modifications, and obfuscated paths** is consistent with **malicious behavior** (e.g., persistence, evasion, or initial access). **Confidence level: 75%** (moderate risk)."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the processes, there are multiple entries with PowerShell commands. The command lines involve creating new items and setting content in various paths. For example, \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\" commands are used to create files and write \"dir\" into them. That seems suspicious because creating files in different directories, especially with paths that have \"..\\\" which might indicate moving up directories, could be part of an attempt to modify system files or inject malicious code.\n\nAlso, there are several \"File created\" events, but most of them are in temporary directories like AppData\\Local\\Temp or Microsoft\\Windows Defender. Those might be legitimate, but the PowerShell scripts creating files in other locations might not be. The repetition of similar commands across different paths could indicate a pattern, maybe trying to establish persistence or modify system behavior.\n\nThe \"Image loaded\" events mention .NET Framework DLLs and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. While loading these is normal, if combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a more complex attack. However, the main red flags here are the multiple PowerShell commands creating and modifying files in various directories, which is a common technique in malware for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nI should check if there's any indication of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or unusual network activity, but those aren't mentioned here. The events are all local file operations and process activities. However, the frequency and the nature of the PowerShell commands (using New-Item and Set-Content in different paths) suggest that someone is trying to manipulate the file system, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nConfidence-wise, since there are multiple instances of similar suspicious commands, but no direct evidence of exploitation or network activity, I'd say it's interesting but not definitive. Maybe around 0.75 confidence. The justification would be the repeated PowerShell commands creating and modifying files in various directories, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating and modifying files across various directories using 'New-Item' and 'Set-Content', which is suspicious.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a PowerShell process checking if a specific executable exists. The command line uses Test-Path to check for \"registro_geral.exe\". That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script. But the path mentioned, \"C:\\\\estrutura_comum\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\entrada_padrao\\\\bin\\\\registro_geral.exe\", doesn't look standard. Maybe that's a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But there's also MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Loading those might be part of regular operations, but maybe not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreated event in the Temp directory with a filename like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. Temporary files created by PowerShell scripts could be normal, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are multiple PowerShell scripts checking for the existence of certain files. The paths mentioned (like C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\entrada_temporario\\\\elemento_base\\\\src\\\\unidade_principal.cs) seem arbitrary. If these files are part of a legitimate application, that's fine, but if they're being checked in a way that's unusual for the system, it might be suspicious.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. These could be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern of accessing processes or modifying registry values repeatedly, that might indicate something malicious. However, the logs don't show any obvious changes to critical registry keys or processes that are typically targeted by malware.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes is normal. The command lines for cmd.exe are checking if a file exists in the temp directory, which is a common administrative task. However, the repeated use of PowerShell with these checks might be part of a larger script that's trying to determine the environment before proceeding with more actions.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: the repeated PowerShell checks for specific files in non-standard paths, along with the creation of temporary script files, might indicate that someone is probing the system for certain files or trying to execute scripts. However, without seeing actual malicious activity (like downloading payloads, executing commands, or modifying system settings), it's hard to confirm. The logs could be part of a legitimate script that's just checking for dependencies or configuration files.\n\nBut since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should note that the combination of these events, especially the non-standard paths and temporary file creation, might warrant further examination. It's not conclusive evidence of a security threat, but it's enough to flag the activity for closer inspection. So, the answer would be that the batch is interesting enough to investigate further, but more data would be needed to determine if it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Interest:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripts with Non-Standard Paths:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` to check for files in unusual directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\unidade_secundario.cs`). These paths lack standard system or application directory structures, which could indicate probing for specific files (e.g., configuration files, dependencies, or potential targets for exploitation).\n\n2. **Temporary Script Files Created in User Directories:**\n   - Files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1` are created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. While temporary script creation is common during PowerShell execution, this pattern could also be used by attackers to stage malicious payloads or bypass security controls.\n\n3. **Frequent Process and Registry Activity:**\n   - Repeated `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` tasks (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) might suggest attempts to interact with system processes or evade detection. However, these events alone are not conclusive of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No direct evidence of payload execution, command injection, or unauthorized modifications is present. The scripts appear to perform **file existence checks** rather than destructive actions.\n\n### **Contextual Considerations:**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases:** The activity could be part of a **legitimate script** (e.g., dependency checks, environment validation) or a **benign automation tool**. However, the non-standard paths and repetitive checks raise questions about their purpose.\n- **Potential Threats:** If these scripts are part of a **phishing campaign**, **reconnaissance**, or **exploitation chain**, they may be probing for vulnerabilities or preparing for further attacks (e.g., checking for the presence of specific files before deploying malware).\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional events (e.g., network connections, file modifications, user activity) that might contextualize these PowerShell scripts.\n- **Analyze Script Content:** Inspect the contents of temporary files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*` to determine if they contain malicious code.\n- **Monitor User Behavior:** Investigate the user (`fiddelis`) for other anomalous activity or access to sensitive resources.\n- **Check for Known Threats:** Use threat intelligence platforms to see if the file paths or scripts match known malicious patterns.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not definitively indicate a security breach, the **combination of non-standard paths, temporary script creation, and repetitive checks** suggests **potential reconnaissance or preparation for further malicious activity**. This warrants **closer scrutiny** and **additional forensic analysis** to rule out threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole, so I can't look at individual events in isolation.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a File Delete logged by PowerShell, deleting a temporary script file. That's normal, maybe part of cleanup. Then there's a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. The next few events are PowerShell processes checking if certain files exist, like 'elemento_base.cs' and others. These seem like checks to see if files are present before proceeding, maybe part of a script's logic.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set and Process accessed events, which could be benign, but might also indicate some configuration changes. The 'whoami.exe' process running is standard for checking user identity, so that's probably okay.\n\nNow, looking at the command lines for some PowerShell processes, they're using 'Test-Path' to check for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various directories. The fact that this script is being checked multiple times in different paths might be suspicious. 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' sounds like a script that could capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. However, just checking if the file exists doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious. But the repetition across different paths might indicate an attempt to locate or access this script from multiple locations, which could be part of a larger malicious operation.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading .dll files, including those from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a red flag.\n\nThe presence of multiple 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events for temporary files might be part of normal operations, but when combined with the repeated checks for 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', it raises a flag. The fact that the same script name is checked in different directories might indicate an attempt to access or execute this script, which could be malicious.\n\nHowever, without seeing actual execution of the script or other indicators like network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of multiple checks for a potentially malicious script name, along with file creation and deletion, might be enough to warrant further investigation. The user might be looking for signs of data exfiltration or keystroke logging, which are common in malware.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious patterns that could be worth investigating, even if not conclusive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits a mix of normal system behavior and potential indicators of suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion Cycles:**\n   - PowerShell repeatedly creates and deletes temporary script files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`). While this could be part of script execution cleanup, the pattern of creation followed by immediate deletion may be used to obscure malicious activity or evade detection.\n\n2. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in various directories (e.g., `unidade_logico\\elemento_logico\\...`). The name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is highly indicative of keystroke logging malware, which is commonly used for data exfiltration. The repetition across different paths suggests an attempt to locate or access this script, possibly to execute it.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads .dll files, including those from Windows Defender (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). While these are legitimate system components, their presence in conjunction with suspicious script activity could indicate an attempt to bypass or interact with security software.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation Events:**\n   - Multiple \"Pipe Created\" events (e.g., via `PipeEvent` rule) may indicate inter-process communication. While this is common in legitimate scenarios, it could also be used to exfiltrate data or coordinate malicious actions.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - A `winlogbeat.yml.new` file is created in the Downloads directory. This could be part of a legitimate configuration update, but the absence of context (e.g., user activity, source of the file) raises questions about its origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Recurring Reference to `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:** The repeated checks for this script name across multiple directories suggest an attempt to locate or access it, which is highly unusual and indicative of potential malicious intent.\n- **File Creation\/Deletion Cycles:** The temporary script files are created and deleted in quick succession, which could be a tactic to avoid leaving persistent traces of malicious activity.\n- **Lack of Contextual Clues:** No evidence of network activity, user interaction, or explicit execution of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is present, leaving the logs ambiguous but warranting further scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script:** Check if the script exists on the system, its contents, and its execution history. Verify if it is part of a legitimate application or if it contains malicious code.\n- **Audit PowerShell Activity:** Review PowerShell logs for additional commands, script execution, or attempts to bypass execution policies (e.g., `Bypass` or `RemoteSigned`).\n- **Monitor Network Traffic:** Check for outbound connections to external servers, which could indicate data exfiltration.\n- **Check for Anomalies in Winlogbeat:** Investigate the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file to determine if it is part of a legitimate configuration change or if it contains malicious settings.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not conclusively prove malicious activity, the recurring checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and the file creation\/deletion cycles are **suspicious and merit further investigation**. These patterns align with tactics used by malware to evade detection and exfiltrate data, even if the full scope of the threat is not yet clear."}
