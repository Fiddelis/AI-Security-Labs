The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe doing that? I should check if that's normal. SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process, but if it's loading these DLLs repeatedly, maybe there's something off. However, those DLLs are in the System32 directory, which is standard. Hmm, maybe not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there are some User Account Management events with process set to null. That might be normal system events, but if they're frequent, maybe not. But in the logs, they're not too many, just a few instances. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, rundll32.exe is executing a command with shell32.dll. That's common for some system functions, but the command line looks a bit long. The GUID here might be related to some COM object. Not sure if that's malicious, but sometimes attackers use rundll32 for executing malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nsvchost.exe and Registry value set events. Those are normal for system services. Winlogbeat creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a log file, probably part of the software's normal operation. EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs, including amsi.dll and Defender's MpOAV.dll. That seems normal because Excel might need those for security checks. But why is there a lot of ImageLoad events for Excel? Maybe just part of normal operations when opening files.\n\nWait, the same file .winlogbeat.yml.new is created twice. That's part of the configuration, maybe just setup steps. The WmiPrvSE.exe process is related to WMI, which is used by legitimate tools but can also be abused. The image loaded event for wmiutils.dll is normal.\n\nThere are multiple User Account Management events, but they don't have process or file info. Maybe just system logins. Services.exe and Logon events are standard. \n\nPutting it all together: Most events seem to be normal system operations. SDXHelper.exe's activity doesn't stand out as malicious. The EXCEL.EXE loading DLLs is expected. The only thing that might be a red flag is the repeated User Account Management events, but without more context, they could be benign. Also, the rundll32 command line might be worth checking, but without knowing the GUID's purpose, it's hard to say. \n\nI don't see any clear signs of malicious activity here. The events don't form a pattern that suggests an attack. So, maybe this batch isn't interesting for investigation. But I should be cautious and note that if there's more context or other events not shown, it could change. But based on what's here, I think it's NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations and legitimate software behavior (e.g., Excel loading standard DLLs, WMI processes, and log file creation by winlogbeat). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are five entries here. The first two are about files being created in the Recent folder under Microsoft Office, specifically a .LNK file named real_values.csv.LNK. The process involved is EXCEL.EXE. Then, the next three entries are DNS queries initiated by EXCEL.EXE, but the file field is null here.\n\nHmm, creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory might be suspicious. Usually, .LNK files are shortcuts, and having one in the Recent folder could indicate that someone is trying to track or access files. But why would Excel create such a file? Maybe it's part of normal operations, but sometimes malware creates shortcuts to hide malicious activities. However, just creating a shortcut isn't necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThen there are the DNS queries from Excel. Excel typically doesn't perform DNS queries unless it's connecting to some online service or there's a macro involved. If there are multiple DNS queries, that might indicate communication with a remote server, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or command and control traffic. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, but the DNS queries don't have any file associated with them. That might mean that the process is making network requests without interacting with a specific file, which could be normal if Excel is accessing online resources. However, combined with the creation of the .LNK file, it's possible that this is part of a larger malicious activity. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Are there any red flags here? The .LNK file in the Recent folder might be a sign of something, but it's not definitive. The DNS queries could be normal if Excel is using online features. However, the fact that there are multiple DNS queries might be a bit unusual for Excel. \n\nAnother angle: the user's name is fiddelis. Not sure if that's relevant. Maybe a typo? Or a specific user account. But without more info, that's not helpful.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of creating a .LNK file in a sensitive location and multiple DNS queries from Excel might be worth investigating. However, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent. It's possible that this is a false positive or part of normal operations. But the presence of both events could indicate something more, so I'd lean towards \"interesting\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE combined with creation of a .LNK file in the Office Recent directory may indicate suspicious activity, such as potential malware persistence or data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
