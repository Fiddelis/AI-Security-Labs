The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. One of the entries shows a command line that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task with the command \"cmd \/c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The path mentioned here is a non-existing script, which might be a red flag. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is unusual and could indicate a persistent backdoor.\n\nAnother entry has schtasks.exe creating a task with a similar command, pointing to another non-existing script. The fact that the scripts don't exist might mean the attacker is trying to execute commands directly without a file, or maybe the file was deleted after execution. The use of \"-ep bypass\" in PowerShell is often used to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThere are also multiple registry value set events, which could be part of configuring the system for persistence. The svchost.exe and conhost.exe processes accessing the registry might be normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's suspicious. \n\nAdditionally, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is a log shipper. However, the presence of multiple file creation events for .yml.new files might be part of configuration changes, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated registry events and scheduled tasks are more concerning.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are numerous, but all are registry value sets. Unless there's something specific about the registry keys, they might not be relevant. However, the volume of events from chrome could be noise, but I need to check if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies, the non-existing scripts, and the multiple registry changes. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of these events suggests an attempt to establish persistence and execute commands without leaving obvious files.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies (-ep bypass), non-existing script paths (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1), and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms and potential command execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
