So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking through the entries, there's a lot of process creation events, especially for powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and sc.exe. The sc.exe commands stand out because they're related to creating services. For example, one event shows sc.exe creating a service called win32times with a binPath that points to a command starting a PowerShell script. The path mentioned is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1, which seems suspicious because the filename includes \"NonExistingScript,\" which might be a red flag. That could indicate an attempt to execute a non-existent script, possibly a way to obfuscate the real payload or a failed attempt.\n\nThen there's another sc.exe event where it's querying the configuration of the same service, which might be part of checking if the service was created successfully. Also, there are multiple registry value set events, which could be part of modifying system settings or trying to persist the malicious activity. Processes like services.exe and svchost.exe are involved in registry changes, which might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe image loaded events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exe might be normal, but the fact that it's being loaded could be part of a larger attack. However, the main concern here is the use of sc.exe to create a service with a suspicious script path. Even though the script isn't found, the attempt to create such a service is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple process accesses for powershell.exe, which is often used in attacks for executing commands. The combination of creating a service with a non-existent script, multiple registry changes, and frequent PowerShell activity suggests potential malicious behavior. However, I should check if there's any legitimate reason for these activities. For example, some legitimate software might use sc.exe to manage services, but the presence of \"NonExistingScript\" is a strong indicator of something wrong.\n\nAnother thing is that there's a file created event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, but the file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal. However, the rest of the events don't seem to relate to that. The majority of the events are focused on process creation and registry changes, which are more concerning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key suspicious points are the sc.exe commands creating a service with a non-existent script, multiple registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell access. These activities are commonly associated with malware trying to establish persistence. While some events could be benign, the combination here is more indicative of a potential security threat. Therefore, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.85 because the indicators are strong but not definitive without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Use of 'sc.exe' to create a service with a suspicious script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), which may indicate persistence attempts. 2) Frequent 'powershell.exe' process access events, often associated with command execution. 3) Unusual registry modification events involving system processes (services.exe, svchost.exe). The combination of service creation with non-existent script paths and repeated PowerShell activity suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first seven events are all about 'chrome.exe' performing a 'Registry value set' task under the RegistryEvent rule. That's a lot of the same event repeating. Maybe that's normal behavior for Chrome? But then again, if it's happening multiple times, maybe there's something suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThen, looking at the eighth and ninth events: 'chrome.exe' is loading images from 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is related to Microsoft Defender. These are legitimate files, but if Chrome is loading them, that might be unusual. Normally, these DLLs are part of the system's security features, so maybe an attacker is trying to bypass them. But I need to check if this is a known legitimate behavior. Hmm, maybe not. Chrome typically doesn't load these DLLs directly. This could indicate a potential issue, like a malicious process trying to interact with or disable the antivirus components.\n\nThe tenth event is 'powershell.exe' accessing a process. That's not inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a sign of something. However, the other events are more concerning. \n\nPutting it all together: the repeated registry changes by Chrome might be normal, but the loading of those specific DLLs by Chrome is suspicious. However, the justification needs to be concise. The presence of multiple registry events might be a red flag, but combined with the unusual DLL loads, it's worth investigating. The confidence level should be around 0.7 because while there are some suspicious activities, they might not be conclusive without more data. \n\nWait, but the user said to consider the combination of all events. If Chrome is modifying the registry multiple times and loading those DLLs, maybe it's an attempt to modify system settings or interfere with security software. That would be interesting. However, I should check if these are common occurrences. If they are, then maybe not. But without knowing the normal behavior, the fact that these events are happening could be a sign of something malicious. \n\nSo, the classification is INTERESTING because of the combination of repeated registry modifications and loading of security-related DLLs by Chrome, which is unusual. The confidence is 0.7 because it's not definitive but raises enough flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated registry modifications (RegistryEvent) and loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), which may indicate evasion techniques or unauthorized system changes. Combined with PowerShell process access, this suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
