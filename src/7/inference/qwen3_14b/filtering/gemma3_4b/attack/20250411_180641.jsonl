{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are a bunch of chrome.exe processes with network connections. That's common, maybe normal browsing. But then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entry, there's a command line that includes csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command is compiling a .cs file into an executable and then running another exe from the temp directory. That seems suspicious because compiling code on the fly, especially from temporary directories, can be a sign of malicious activity. Also, the paths mentioned like C:\\modulo_secundario... might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's the creation of files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The file names like pacote_logico.exe and unidade_padrao.exe don't look like standard system files. Also, the image loaded events for estrutura_ativo.exe and others pointing to .NET framework DLLs might be part of a dropper or loader.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple registry events. While some registry changes are normal, if they're part of a pattern, like setting values in a way that's not typical, that could indicate persistence mechanisms. The presence of RuntimeBroker.exe and other system processes might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's a red flag.\n\nHowever, there are also some normal processes like notepad.exe and conhost.exe. But the overall pattern here seems to involve compiling and executing code from temporary locations, which is a common tactic in malware. The combination of process creation, file creation, and registry changes, along with the use of command-line tools for compilation, points towards potential malicious behavior.\n\nI should also check if there are any obvious signs of compromise. The use of csc.exe to compile a .cs file into an executable, then running it from temp, is a method used by some malware to execute payloads. The fact that multiple processes are accessing each other and modifying the registry could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or evade detection.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The confidence level is high because the combination of events is not typical of normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** INTERESTING  \n**Justification:** The event log contains multiple suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious behavior. Key red flags include:  \n1. **Unusual Compilation Activity**: A `cmd.exe` process executes a command involving `csc.exe` (C# compiler) to compile a `.cs` file into an executable (`pacote_logico.exe`) and subsequently run it from the `Temp` directory. This is a common tactic used by malware to execute payloads dynamically.  \n2. **Suspicious File Paths**: Files like `unidade_padrao.exe` and `modulo_temporario.exe` are created in temporary directories (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`), a common behavior for malware to evade detection.  \n3. **Image Loading from Untrusted Sources**: Processes like `estrutura_ativo.exe` and `componente_comum.exe` load DLLs from `.NET` framework paths, which could indicate exploitation of vulnerabilities or injection techniques.  \n4. **Registry Modifications**: Frequent `Registry value set` events involving processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` may suggest attempts to establish persistence or alter system behavior.  \n5. **Lateral Movement Indicators**: The combination of file creation, process execution, and registry changes aligns with patterns seen in malware campaigns, such as droppers or loaders.  \n\nWhile some processes (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `notepad.exe`) are benign, the overall pattern of dynamic code execution, temporary file usage, and registry tampering warrants further investigation.  \n\n**Confidence Level:** High (85%)  \n**Recommendation:** Perform deeper analysis on the compiled executables, check for unusual network activity linked to these processes, and examine system integrity (e.g., file hashes, registry keys)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so maybe not an issue. But then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a normal process, but frequent registry changes could be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nNext, there's a Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard name; usually, it's calc.exe. Maybe a typo or a renamed process? That could be suspicious. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path seems specific. However, the same file is mentioned twice, which might be redundant.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entries, there are multiple registry value sets. Chrome is a common application, but excessive registry changes might indicate something. Also, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Microsoft Defender. Those are legitimate, but if they're being loaded by chrome, maybe there's a conflict or an attempt to bypass security features?\n\nWait, the process names like Calculator.exe and the repeated registry changes by svchost and chrome could be part of a larger pattern. However, without more context like IP addresses, user actions, or other indicators, it's hard to say. The presence of winlogbeat creating a file might be normal if it's part of a configuration setup. But the repetition of events, especially the registry changes, might indicate a script or malware trying to modify system settings.\n\nBut I also need to consider false positives. Normal system processes can generate these logs. The key is whether there's a combination of events that point to malicious activity. The Calculator.exe with a different name might be a red flag. Also, the multiple registry changes could be part of a persistence mechanism. However, the confidence here is moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they might not be conclusive without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious patterns detected: 1) 'Calculator.exe' (non-standard name) loading system DLLs, 2) repeated 'Registry value set' events by svchost.exe and chrome.exe (potential configuration changes), 3) winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in a user Downloads directory (unusual for log shippers). These could indicate malicious activity or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
