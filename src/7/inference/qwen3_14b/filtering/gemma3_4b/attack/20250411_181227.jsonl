There are multiple entries where PowerShell is executing commands to create scheduled tasks. Each command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe as the executable. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag because running calc.exe via scheduled tasks with admin rights is unusual and could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe other events involve PowerShell accessing the registry and processes, which is normal, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it's suspicious. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks with different names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.) might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Also, the loading of .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll could be part of a more complex attack, maybe trying to execute .NET code or evade detection.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack here. The events are all about task creation and process activities. Since the tasks are set to run calc.exe, which is a legitimate tool, but in this context, it's being used as a payload. The confidence is high because the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges and using PowerShell in this way is commonly associated with malicious activities. Even though it's not a direct attack, the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, RunLevel Highest) that execute calc.exe at logon.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate path, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a temporary script might be part of an attack, like executing malicious code and then cleaning up traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Not sure about that yet. Then, looking at the command line for a powershell.exe process, there's a script that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe. The user here is setting up a scheduled task that runs as Administrators with high privileges. That's suspicious because using scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe (which is a legitimate app) might be a way to hide malicious activities. Also, the command line has a lot of parameters that set the principal to Administrators, which could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. But since there are so many, maybe that's just normal behavior. However, if it's repeated multiple times, it might be something else, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The rest of the logs have entries where the process is None and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" repeated many times. That's concerning because if a process is not identified, it might be a sign of something malicious, like a remote code execution or a command and control channel.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities involving scheduled tasks with admin rights, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and the numerous \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without a process involved. These could all be indicators of a potential security threat. The confidence level might be around 0.8 because there are several suspicious events, but some might be false positives. However, the combination of these events does point towards potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including scheduled task creation with admin privileges, temporary script creation\/deletion, and numerous unattributed 'Execute a Remote Command' events indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use WMI for malicious activities. However, loading a system DLL like taskschd.dll might be normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries with svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, and registry changes can be normal, but multiple changes might indicate something. But alone, not necessarily bad.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the System32 directory is usually protected. Creating a file there might be suspicious. But maybe it's a legitimate task? Hmm.\n\nThen there's an event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no process. That's odd. If the process is None, that could mean the event is from a source that doesn't have a clear process, maybe a service or something else. But executing remote commands without a clear process might be a red flag.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in user directories. That's common for scripts, but creating files like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be normal. However, if there's unexpected file creation, that could be a sign.\n\nAnother entry is chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files (AMSI is part of Windows Defender). But loading them from Chrome might not be standard. Wait, the paths are C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and the Defender DLL. Those are correct paths, so maybe it's just Chrome interacting with them normally. Not sure.\n\nThen there's a lot of registry changes from chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. Multiple registry events could indicate some kind of configuration change or maybe an exploit. But again, need more context.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its configuration. Not suspicious.\n\nPowerShell creating other text files in downloads. Again, could be normal user activity, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: There's a mix of normal processes and events. The suspicious parts are the svchost creating a file in System32\\Tasks, the remote command execution with no process, and the excessive registry changes from Chrome. However, some of these could be benign. But the presence of multiple registry changes and the file creation in a protected directory might indicate a potential security issue. The remote command execution without a process is also a bit concerning. However, without more context or additional indicators, it's hard to be certain. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6. So, the classification would be INTERESTING because there are several events that could be indicative of malicious activity, even though some might be normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including svchost.exe creating a file in the protected System32\\\\Tasks directory, unexplained 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, and excessive registry modifications by chrome.exe which is unusual for a browser. These patterns could indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
