First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe and powershell.exe with some registry events. But then I see a whoami.exe process, which is normal, but then there's a powershell.exe command line that's running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is definitely a red flag. That script is likely capturing keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe loading various DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be part of the script's execution. Also, there are several FileCreate and FileDelete events, including a temporary file that's created and then deleted. That could be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths. Even though the paths are different, the script name is the same, which suggests that this might be part of a larger attack where the attacker is trying to log keystrokes. The fact that the log path is set to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log indicates that the attacker is trying to store the captured data in a temporary directory, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are events related to winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be part of the logging or data exfiltration. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell script execution and the keystroke logging. Even though some events are normal (like registry changes from chrome.exe), the combination of the PowerShell activities points towards a potential security incident.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the presence of keystroke logging scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even if some events are benign, the overall pattern suggests an investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in temporary directories, combined with file creation\/deletion events and .NET DLL image loads, indicate potential keystroke logging and malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The task is to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Since it's just one event, I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nLooking at the event: the process is powershell.exe, and the Windows log indicates a file was created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the action here is a file creation, which is a normal activity. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for users to save files. \n\nNow, considering the classification. The event alone doesn't show any signs of malicious behavior. There's no mention of suspicious commands, network activity, or any other indicators of compromise. The file name 'entrada_padrao.txt' seems generic, possibly related to a standard input file, which might be part of normal user activity. \n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers use PowerShell to execute scripts that create files as part of their payload. However, without additional context or other events (like process injections, unexpected network connections, or unauthorized access), this single event isn't enough to flag as interesting. \n\nThe justification would be that the event is a normal file creation by PowerShell, which is common. The confidence is around 0.2 because there's no strong evidence of malicious activity. Since the classification is based on the entire batch, and only one event is present, it's not interesting. \n\nI should make sure not to overinterpret. Unless there are other events that correlate, this alone isn't suspicious. So the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A single file creation event by powershell.exe in a user's Downloads directory is consistent with normal user activity. No suspicious indicators (e.g., unusual commands, network activity, or sensitive file paths) are present in the limited context provided.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
