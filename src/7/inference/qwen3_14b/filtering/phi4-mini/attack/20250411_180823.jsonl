{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe and process access events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but just seeing ProcessAccess might not be enough. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks. The command line has some odd names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command line parameters seem to be creating tasks that run calc.exe. Now, calc.exe is just the calculator, but if it's being triggered by scheduled tasks, especially with names that look like they might be obfuscated or part of a larger attack, that's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of svchost.exe and schtasks.exe creating files in the Tasks directory. Creating scheduled tasks, especially with system-level permissions (like \/ru system), could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the file paths mentioned, like C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon, might be part of a pattern where attackers are setting up persistent access.\n\nAnother thing is the use of cmd.exe \/c calc.exe. While calc.exe itself is benign, using it in this context might be a way to execute other commands or part of a larger payload. The repetition of similar task names with different prefixes (modulo_principal_005, pacote_secundario_005) suggests a possible automated or scripted attack, maybe trying to create multiple points of entry.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence. The involvement of svchost.exe and conhost.exe in these events might be normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's worth looking into.\n\nHowever, there are also normal processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe doing regular activities. The key here is the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with suspicious names, using system-level permissions, and the potential for persistence through these tasks. Even though some elements are normal, the overall pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with non-standard names and using calc.exe in this way might indicate malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of multiple scheduled tasks created with potentially malicious intent, along with the use of system-level permissions and the repetition of similar task names, makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some processes are normal, but the combination of these events is suspicious enough to warrant looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Obfuscated Names:**\n   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` creating scheduled tasks with names like:\n     - `elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon`\n     - `unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup`\n     - `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`\n   - These names follow a pattern (`[adjective]_[number]_[Trigger]`), suggesting **obfuscation** or **automated task generation**, which is common in malware campaigns.\n\n2. **Use of `calc.exe` in Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - Tasks are configured to execute `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`, which is typically benign but **could be a decoy** or part of a larger payload (e.g., executing hidden commands via `cmd.exe`).\n\n3. **Persistence via System-Level Permissions:**\n   - Tasks are created with `\/ru system` (run as **SYSTEM**), indicating an attempt to **establish persistence** with elevated privileges.\n\n4. **File Creation in System-Protected Directories:**\n   - Files like `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon` and `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup` are created in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks`, a **highly sensitive location**. This is a common tactic for malware to ensure persistence across reboots.\n\n5. **Unusual Registry Modifications:**\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events involving `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` may indicate **tampering with system settings** or **registry-based persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Concerning:**\n- The combination of **scheduled task creation**, **system-level execution**, and **obfuscated naming** is highly indicative of **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, lateral movement, or payload delivery).\n- While some processes (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are normal, the **context** (e.g., task creation, registry changes) suggests **unauthorized system modifications**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check the content of the created scheduled tasks** (e.g., inspect `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\*` for hidden or malicious scripts).\n2. **Analyze the full command lines** of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` for obfuscated payloads (e.g., encoded commands, PowerShell scripts).\n3. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to determine if the tasks are part of a larger attack chain.\n4. **Scan for malware** using endpoint detection tools, focusing on the involved processes and files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and **requires immediate investigation** due to the use of persistence mechanisms, obfuscation, and system-level modifications. The confidence level for flagging this as malicious is **high (85â€“90%)**, though further analysis is needed to confirm the intent."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing actions like creating pipes, setting registry values, and loading image files. But wait, there's also some activity from powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Let me check each entry.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, chrome.exe is doing registry modifications multiple times. That's a lot. But is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own purposes, like settings or extensions. However, repeated registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're modifying critical keys. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the filename is .yml.new, which could be part of a setup process. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files. Loading them is normal, so that's probably okay. But maybe if they were loaded from an unusual path, but here the paths look standard.\n\nThen there's a file creation by powershell.exe named \"unidade_ativo.txt\". That's a text file, maybe just a regular file. But why is PowerShell creating it? If it's part of a script, maybe. Not immediately suspicious, but worth noting.\n\nAnother event is whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user information. If it's run by a legitimate user, that's fine. But if it's part of a privilege escalation or information gathering, that could be bad. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe. That might indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate the process, but again, depends on the context. Maybe a legitimate process, maybe not.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from chrome.exe doing normal activities. The PowerShell and whoami.exe events are not necessarily malicious. However, the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a sign of something. But since Chrome can modify the registry, and without seeing the actual changes made, it's hard to classify this as malicious. The other events don't show clear signs of attack. So maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be medium. Alternatively, if the registry changes are in sensitive areas, but the logs don't specify that. So overall, maybe it's not interesting unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate activities from chrome.exe (registry modifications, pipe creation, and loading standard system DLLs) and benign file operations (e.g., PowerShell creating a text file, winlogbeat configuring itself). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
