First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe being accessed. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to check user identity. Next, there's a cmd.exe process that's trying to create a service called win32times with a command line that includes starting a non-existent PowerShell script. The path mentioned is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. The fact that the script is non-existent might be a red flag, but maybe it's a typo or a mistake. However, the use of sc create to set up a service that runs a script is suspicious. \n\nThen there are multiple entries of services.exe and other processes modifying the registry. A lot of Registry value set events could indicate that some configuration changes are happening. The sc.exe commands are used to create and query services, which is normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of an attempt to persist or modify system behavior. \n\nThere's also a mention of calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected context, that could be an issue. However, in this case, the path is the standard System32 location, so maybe that's okay.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of setup. However, the presence of .yml.new suggests that it's a new configuration file being created, which might be part of a setup or update. But unless there's other malicious activity, this might not be an issue.\n\nLooking at the repetition of Registry value set events for services.exe, svchost.exe, and others, it could be part of a larger effort to modify system settings or install a service. The combination of creating a service with sc.exe and modifying the registry might be an attempt to establish persistence. Additionally, the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with commands that reference non-existent scripts could be an attempt to execute malicious code that's not yet present, or maybe the scripts were deleted after execution.\n\nThe multiple entries for Registry events could also be indicative of a malware trying to change system settings to avoid detection or to maintain access. However, without more context, like unusual registry keys or values being modified, it's a bit hard to tell. But the fact that there are several events related to service creation and registry changes might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch shows multiple suspicious activities such as service creation with potentially malicious commands, numerous registry modifications, and references to non-existent scripts. These could be signs of an attack or malicious activity, so classifying this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75 seems appropriate. It's not a definitive proof, but it's enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75,\n  \"REASONING\": \"The log shows multiple suspicious activities: 1) `cmd.exe` attempting to create a service (`win32times`) with a command line referencing a non-existent PowerShell script (`NonExistingScript.ps1`), which may indicate obfuscation or failed execution. 2) Repeated `Registry value set` events involving `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other system processes, suggesting potential configuration changes or persistence attempts. 3) Use of `sc.exe` to manage services, which, while legitimate, combined with other anomalies, raises concerns. These patterns could indicate an attack chain or malicious activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst two events: chrome.exe is setting a registry value. That's a common activity, maybe part of normal operations. Not sure yet. The third event is chrome.exe loading an image from a specific path. Wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Hmm, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender's antimalware platform. But why is chrome.exe loading it? That might be unusual. Typically, Chrome doesn't interact with Defender's DLLs directly. Maybe a legitimate process, but could also be a sign of something malicious.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe accessed, but no file involved. Process access can be normal, but depending on context. However, the third event's DLL path is specific. Let me check if that DLL is legitimate. Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll is a real file, but if it's being loaded by chrome.exe, that's unexpected. Maybe a malicious process is using Chrome to load a DLL. Alternatively, maybe a legitimate scenario, but it's a red flag.\n\nCombining all events: two registry changes by Chrome, then loading a Defender DLL, and PowerShell access. The key point is the unexpected loading of MpOAV.dll by Chrome. That's suspicious. Even though the other events are normal, the combination might indicate an attack. However, I need to be cautious. Maybe there's a legitimate reason. But the presence of that specific DLL path in a Chrome process is unusual. So the classification would be INTERESTING with moderate confidence. Not 100% sure, but enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Chrome.exe is loading a Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll) from a non-standard path, which is unusual behavior. Combined with multiple registry modifications by Chrome, this may indicate potential malicious activity or unexpected process interactions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
