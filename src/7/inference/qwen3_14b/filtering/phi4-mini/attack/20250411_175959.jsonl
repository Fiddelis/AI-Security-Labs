{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag here. But then I see several entries about powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, it's executing a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance. \n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but the presence of Windows Defender's DLL could be a sign that the script is interacting with antivirus components, which might be suspicious. \n\nAnother notable event is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating a temporary script and then deleting it could be an attempt to hide the script's existence, which is a common tactic in malicious activities. \n\nAlso, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for the same PowerShell command line. These events might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening, but repeated entries could suggest that the process is running for an extended period or that there's some kind of loop or persistent activity.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of reconnaissance commands (like checking users and groups), loading potentially suspicious DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and repeated provider lifecycle events might indicate that an attacker is trying to gather information or establish persistence on the system. Even though some activities could be benign, the pattern here seems more aligned with malicious behavior. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. For example, checking user groups or running scripts might be done by authorized users. But the deletion of the script file and the number of events might tip the scales towards being suspicious. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.75. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a security breach. The key indicators are the reconnaissance commands and the temporary file handling.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executes commands to gather system information:\n     - `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `dir C:\\Users`, etc.\n     - This suggests **reconnaissance** to map users, groups, and system configurationâ€”common in **pre-exploitation phases** of attacks.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`) is **created and immediately deleted** in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory.\n   - This pattern is often used to **obfuscate malicious activity** or execute scripts without leaving persistent traces.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - `powershell.exe` loads `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender). While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **interaction with antivirus components** (e.g., bypassing detection or exploiting vulnerabilities).\n\n4. **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - The same PowerShell command line is logged multiple times under \"Provider Lifecycle\" events. This might indicate **persistent or looping behavior**, potentially tied to **exploits or persistence mechanisms**.\n\n5. **High Volume of Events**:\n   - Multiple entries for the same command line and process suggest **prolonged or repeated execution**, which could signal **malicious automation** or **script-based attacks**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- The combination of **reconnaissance**, **ephemeral file usage**, and **unusual DLL interactions** aligns with tactics used in **post-exploitation phases** (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement).\n- The deletion of the temporary script file may be an attempt to **avoid detection** by log analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the PowerShell script** (if recoverable) for malicious content.\n- **Check for unauthorized user accounts** or group memberships (e.g., via `net user` and `get-localgroupmember`).\n- **Audit Windows Defender logs** for anomalies related to `MpOAV.dll`.\n- **Monitor the Temp directory** for unexpected file creation\/deletion patterns.\n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) to identify lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict**\n**Interesting for investigation (Score: 0.75\/1)**  \nThe logs exhibit behaviors consistent with **malicious activity**, though not definitively proven. Further analysis is required to confirm whether this represents a **security incident** or **legitimate administrative activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. That's a log shipper, so maybe normal. But the file path is in the Downloads folder, which sometimes can be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, so maybe that's just part of its operation.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, etc. This looks like someone is trying to gather system information. That's suspicious because these commands can be used to enumerate users, groups, and credentials. The same command line appears twice, which might indicate that the process is being repeated or maybe a script is running multiple times.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file named pacote_ativo.txt by powershell.exe. Not sure what that file is, but the name doesn't ring a bell. Could be benign, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that powershell is creating files might be part of normal operations, but combined with the previous command line, it might be more concerning.\n\nThere are multiple entries for chrome.exe setting registry values. That's common for Chrome updates or configuration changes, so probably normal. The same for the updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll is normal as well. combase.dll is a system file, so that's expected.\n\nNow, the key points here are the powershell.exe processes running commands that gather system information. The command line includes net user, which can list users, and cmdkey.exe \/list, which shows stored credentials. This could be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker trying to map the system. Also, the fact that there are multiple instances of the same command line might indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure they get the information even if one instance is blocked.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of the .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but creating a new config file could be part of a setup, but if it's in the Downloads folder, maybe it's a drop zone for malicious files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple powershell.exe processes running commands that collect system information and the creation of files by powershell could indicate a potential security threat. The logs don't show obvious malware, but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the answer would be that this is interesting because of the reconnaissance activities and file creation by powershell, which might be signs of an attacker gathering information.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance Commands**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script containing multiple system enumeration commands:\n     ```powershell\n     {net user; get-localuser; get-localgroupmember -group Users; cmdkey.exe \/list; ls C:\/Users; get-childitem C:\\Users; dir C:\\Users; get-localgroup; net localgroup}\n     ```\n     - **Purpose**: These commands gather **user accounts, group memberships, stored credentials (via `cmdkey`), and directory structures**. This is **consistent with attacker behavior during reconnaissance** (e.g., mapping users, checking for sensitive data, or identifying potential targets for lateral movement).\n\n   - **Repetition**: The same command line appears **twice**, suggesting either a script being re-run or an attempt to bypass detection.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation by PowerShell**:\n   - **File**: `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`\n     - **Context**: PowerShell creating files in the `StartupProfileData` directory is **unusual**. While PowerShell scripts can legitimately create files, this path is often associated with **malicious persistence mechanisms** (e.g., configuring startup scripts or hiding malicious code).\n\n   - **File**: `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (repeated in another entry) and `pacote_ativo.txt` (a file with an ambiguous name, possibly obfuscated or part of an attack chain).\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Configuration File in Downloads Folder**:\n   - **File**: `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\Downloads\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`\n     - **Context**: While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log shipper, creating a `.yml.new` file in the **Downloads** folder is **unusual**. This could indicate:\n       - A **misconfigured** or **malicious** instance of Winlogbeat.\n       - A **drop zone** for an attacker to stage malicious configuration files (e.g., to inject malicious logging rules or exfiltrate data).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**:\n- **Chrome and Google Updater Processes**: These are normal for system updates and user activity.\n- **SDXHelper.exe loading `combase.dll`**: This is a legitimate system component (part of Windows COM services).\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: If Winlogbeat is properly configured, this could be a normal operation, but the **location** (`Downloads` folder) raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis log batch contains **behavior consistent with an attacker performing reconnaissance** (via PowerShell) and **unusual file creation** that could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence setup, data exfiltration, or misconfigured tools). \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Investigate the **PowerShell script execution** (e.g., check for malicious payloads in memory or on disk).  \n- Analyze the **`.winlogbeat.yml.new`** file for anomalies (e.g., unexpected configurations, obfuscation).  \n- Monitor for **unauthorized file creation** in user directories and ensure **PowerShell execution policies** are appropriately enforced.  \n\nThis is **definitely worth further investigation**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: conhost.exe is involved in a registry value set. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, usually related to console windows. Registry changes can be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper is part of the Windows Search service, and urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL. However, sometimes malware can use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But here, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32, which is a standard location. Not sure yet, but maybe not a red flag.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs. The file is a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration setup. This seems normal, maybe part of installation or configuration changes.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe creating a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell creating files can be normal, but sometimes it's used in malicious activities. However, without knowing the content of the file, it's hard to tell. Maybe just a regular file creation.\n\nFifth event: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe being run with command line arguments. The command line includes \/ua and \/installsource scheduler. Microsoft Edge updates are usually handled by the system, but the scheduler might be involved in scheduled tasks. This could be normal, but sometimes malicious software uses similar command lines. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, svchost.exe changing a registry value. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Registry changes here could be part of normal service operations, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother event with MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler. If this is part of a legitimate update process, it might be okay. However, sometimes malware uses Task Scheduler to persist. But the path is correct, so maybe not.\n\nThen, powershell.exe changing a registry value again. PowerShell interacting with the registry can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. However, without seeing specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to determine.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe having a process accessed event. This might indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which could be part of a larger attack chain. But again, without more context, it's unclear.\n\nPutting it all together, there are a few suspicious elements: multiple registry changes by PowerShell and svchost, which are sometimes used in attacks. The SDXHelper loading a legitimate DLL, but maybe that's okay. The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate process might be normal. However, the presence of multiple events involving PowerShell and registry changes, along with file creations, could indicate some level of activity that's worth investigating. However, none of the events are extremely obvious malicious activities. So, I'd say this is interesting but not highly suspicious. Maybe confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell and registry modifications, along with file creation in user directories, suggest potential legitimate activity or early-stage malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
