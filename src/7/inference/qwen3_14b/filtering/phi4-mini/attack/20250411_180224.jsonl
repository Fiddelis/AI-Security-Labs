Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's a process creation for cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line is creating a task named \"win32times\" that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to bypass execution policy restrictions. The script path is \"c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\" – the name includes \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a red flag. However, the file is not found, so maybe it's a typo or a misconfiguration. But the fact that they're creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (running as system) and using PowerShell with bypass is suspicious.\n\nNext, there's an entry for powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not sure yet, but maybe related to the previous task.\n\nThird event is another schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task with a similar command line, but the script path is different: \"c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\". Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. Maybe the attacker is trying to create a scheduled task that runs a non-existent script, which could be a way to hide the actual malicious activity or a mistake. But the fact that they're creating these tasks with system privileges is concerning.\n\nThen, there's an ImageLoad event for schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is normal, so probably not an issue here.\n\nMultiple entries for svchost.exe with Registry value set events. That's common for system processes, so maybe not malicious unless there's a pattern. But there are several of them, which might be normal system behavior.\n\nAnother svchost.exe event with a FileCreated event for \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times\". That's the scheduled task file created, which aligns with the earlier schtasks commands. So this is a confirmation that the task was created.\n\nThen, more schtasks.exe ImageLoad events again, which are normal.\n\ncmd.exe and conhost.exe with Registry value set events. Again, could be normal, but maybe part of some configuration changes.\n\nThere are entries for winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The user might be setting up or testing it, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files like \"estrutura_geral.txt\" and \"entrada_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads folder. These could be benign files, but if they're part of a larger pattern, maybe not. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe entries with Registry value set events. Chrome is a common browser, and registry changes could be from extensions or normal operations. But so many entries might be a red flag if they're all related to the same thing, but without more info, not sure.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is normal, just checking the user. Not suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that have non-existent filenames, running as system, and using -ep bypass. Creating scheduled tasks with system privileges is a common attack vector. However, the scripts don't exist, which could be a mistake or a way to avoid detection. The other events seem to be normal system activity or user operations. But the combination of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and using bypass parameters is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. So I think this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges:**\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`** are used to create scheduled tasks named **`win32times`** that execute PowerShell scripts with **`-ep bypass`** (bypasses execution policy restrictions). These tasks are configured to run as **`SYSTEM`** (high-privilege), which is highly unusual for benign processes.\n   - Example command line:\n     ```\n     schtasks \/create \/tn \"win32times\" \/tr \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -f c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\"\n     ```\n   - **Non-existent script paths** (e.g., `c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) suggest either a **misconfiguration**, **attempted obfuscation**, or **malicious intent** (e.g., hiding the actual payload or testing for success).\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage with Bypass Flags:**\n   - **`-ep bypass`** is a common technique in attacks to execute scripts without user interaction, often linked to **payload delivery** or **lateral movement**.\n\n3. **File Creation in User Directories:**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** create files like `estrutura_geral.txt`, `entrada_ativo.txt`, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the **`Downloads`** directory. While these could be benign, the combination with elevated task creation raises concerns about **data exfiltration** or **log tampering**.\n\n4. **High Volume of Registry Changes:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`chrome.exe`** trigger multiple **`Registry value set`** events. While normal for some applications, the **volume** and **lack of context** (e.g., no clear purpose) could indicate **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious Activity:**\n- **`whoami.exe`** and **`schtasks.exe`** (normal system tools).\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating configuration files (likely part of log management setup).\n- **`ImageLoad`** events for **`taskschd.dll`** (normal behavior for `schtasks.exe`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware persistence** (e.g., scheduled tasks with elevated privileges) and **techniques used in attacks** (e.g., PowerShell bypass). The non-existent script paths and lack of clear benign context justify **further investigation**, including:\n- Checking if the scheduled tasks actually execute.\n- Analyzing the created files for hidden payloads.\n- Reviewing system logs for additional anomalies.\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** – the activity aligns with attack patterns and requires deeper analysis."}
