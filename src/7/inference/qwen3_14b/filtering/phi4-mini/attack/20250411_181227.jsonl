{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing some system log events. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines in several entries are similar, involving the creation of scheduled tasks using PowerShell commands. Specifically, they use New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, and Register-ScheduledTask. The tasks are set to run calc.exe at logon, which is a classic example of a benign command, but the context here might be different.\n\nWait, the trigger is set to \"AtLogon,\" which means the task runs when a user logs on. The principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, so it's running with administrative privileges. That's a red flag. Normally, scheduled tasks with high privileges can be a sign of malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell commands, they're creating scheduled tasks with the name \"unidade_ativo$object\" and similar variations. The use of $object in the task name seems odd. Also, the fact that multiple tasks are being registered with different names but similar structures might indicate an attempt to create multiple persistence points.\n\nThere are also entries about image loading, like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. Mscoree.dll is related to .NET execution, which is normal for PowerShell, but MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Maybe the script is interacting with antivirus components, which could be a sign of evasion techniques.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1 is created and then deleted. This might be part of a script execution that's trying to avoid leaving traces, which is common in malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if these activities are actually malicious. The use of calc.exe is a test command, often used in examples. But combined with the scheduled tasks and the elevated privileges, it's suspicious. Also, the repeated creation of tasks with different names could be an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and ImageLoad events related to PowerShell suggests that the script is executing multiple steps, possibly loading additional components or checking for security software (like the MpOAV.dll). The deletion of the temporary script file might be an attempt to clean up after execution, which is another red flag.\n\nConsidering all these points, even though some elements could be benign (like testing scripts), the combination of creating multiple high-privilege scheduled tasks, interacting with security software, and cleaning up temporary files makes this activity suspicious. It's likely a sign of malicious activity, such as an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potentially malicious activity** involving PowerShell-based persistence mechanisms and suspicious file operations. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Administrative Privileges**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands create scheduled tasks (e.g., `Register-ScheduledTask`) configured to execute **`calc.exe`** at user logon, with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the principal and **`RunLevel Highest`**.\n   - **Why this is suspicious**: \n     - `calc.exe` is a benign utility, but its use here may be a **test** or **obfuscation** technique.\n     - Scheduled tasks with **admin privileges** are often used for **persistence** by attackers to maintain access after initial compromise.\n\n2. **Unusual Task Names**:\n   - Task names like `unidade_ativo$object`, `tarefa_geral$object` (with `$object` appended) suggest **dynamic naming** or **script-generated identifiers**, which is atypical for legitimate tasks and may indicate **automated tooling** (e.g., malware).\n\n3. **File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created in `%Temp%` and immediately deleted.\n   - **Why this is suspicious**: \n     - Temporary file creation\/deletion is a common **anti-forensic technique** to avoid leaving evidence.\n     - The filename `PSScriptPolicyTest` may reference **PowerShell script execution policies**, suggesting **bypassing restrictions**.\n\n4. **Loading of Potentially Malicious DLLs**:\n   - **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender component) is loaded by PowerShell. While not inherently malicious, its interaction with PowerShell could indicate **evasion techniques** (e.g., bypassing antivirus).\n   - **`mscorlib.ni.dll`** and **`mscoree.dll`** are .NET-related, which is normal for PowerShell, but their presence in logs may indicate **script execution** or **sandbox detection**.\n\n5. **Repeated Process and Image Load Events**:\n   - Multiple entries for **`ProcessCreate`**, **`ImageLoad`**, and **`ProcessAccess`** suggest **complex script execution** or **module injection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The scheduled tasks could be used to re-establish access if the attacker is evicted.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2)**: The temporary script might be part of a larger payload (e.g., downloading additional malware).\n- **Anti-Analysis Techniques**: File deletion and interaction with Windows Defender may aim to **evade detection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of PowerShell Execution**:\n   - Check the **parent process** of the PowerShell instances (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`) and **user context** (e.g., admin vs. standard user).\n   - Examine **PowerShell logs** (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell\/Operational` event log) for full script content.\n\n2. **Analyze the Deleted Script**:\n   - Recover the deleted file from **shadow copies** or **temp directory backups** (if available) to inspect its contents.\n\n3. **Check for Additional Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Use `schtasks \/query \/fo LIST \/v` to list all scheduled tasks and verify if others exist with similar patterns.\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **network activity** (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) from the affected system, as this could indicate C2 communication.\n\n5. **Review Windows Defender Logs**:\n   - Investigate interactions with `MpOAV.dll` to determine if **malware was detected or blocked**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity strongly resembles **malware execution** designed to establish **persistence** and **evade detection**. Immediate investigation is warranted to determine if the system has been compromised and to mitigate further risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command_line shows they're using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common trick to test if the task is set up. The trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with highest privileges. That seems a bit odd because why would an administrator task be created with such permissions? Also, the task is named 'estrutura_auxiliar' and 'unidade_comum' later. Maybe that's just a name, but the fact that it's using elevated privileges might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' as the task. That's definitely suspicious. If there are multiple remote commands executed, that could indicate an attack. But wait, the process is None for those entries. Hmm, maybe the remote command execution is being logged without a specific process, which might be an indicator of something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events. There's a file created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum' by svchost.exe. That path is in the System32 directory, which is a common place for legitimate tasks, but creating a task there might be normal. However, the other file created is 'entrada_principal.txt' in the Downloads folder by PowerShell. That might be benign, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be used for data exfiltration.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries have registry value sets and image loaded events. The image loaded is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a process like chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll, that might be normal, but if it's being manipulated, it could be an attempt to bypass detection. However, the registry events might be part of normal operations, but multiple entries could be a sign of something else.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell.exe events, the first one is creating a scheduled task, and another is creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That might be part of the attacker's setup. The presence of both scheduled tasks and remote command executions could indicate an attempt to establish persistence and execute commands remotely.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The combination of creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges, multiple remote command executions, and file creations in sensitive directories might indicate a potential security threat. However, some of these events could be benign. For example, scheduled tasks are often used for legitimate purposes, and remote command execution might be part of a remote management tool. But the repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' and the elevated privileges in the scheduled task suggest something might be wrong.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The presence of a few suspicious events, but not an overwhelming number. However, the combination of elevated task creation and remote command executions is enough to raise suspicion. I'd say this is a medium to high risk, but not 100% certain. Therefore, the batch is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**  \n   - A PowerShell command creates a scheduled task (`estrutura_auxiliar`, `unidade_comum`) with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** permissions and **highest privileges**. This could be an attempt to establish **persistent access** or execute commands under elevated rights, which is highly unusual for benign activity.\n\n2. **Multiple \"Remote Command Execution\" Events**  \n   - Over 10 entries with the task **`\"Execute a Remote Command\"`** (e.g., process `None`). This could indicate **remote code execution (RCE)** or **exploitation of vulnerabilities** (e.g., via unpatched software). The lack of a specific process (`None`) may suggest obfuscation or exploitation of system-level mechanisms.\n\n3. **File Creation in Sensitive Directories**  \n   - A file (`unidade_comum`) is created in **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\`**, a protected directory. While legitimate tasks exist here, unauthorized creation of files in this location is a red flag for **malware persistence** or **tampering**.\n\n4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**  \n   - PowerShell is used to create files in user directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt`) and modify registry settings. This could be part of **data exfiltration** or **configuration changes** to evade detection.\n\n5. **Chrome.exe and AMSI.dll Interaction**  \n   - Chrome.exe loads **`amsi.dll`** (Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface). While normal, this could indicate an attempt to **bypass AMSI** or **interact with security software**, which is common in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Analysis**\n- **Scheduled Tasks as Persistence Mechanism**: The use of elevated-privilege tasks aligns with techniques used by attackers to maintain **long-term access** to a system.\n- **Remote Command Execution**: Repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events suggest **external control** over the system, possibly via **RDP, remote management tools, or exploited services**.\n- **File Creation in System32**: The task `unidade_comum` (translated as \"main unit\") might be a **misleading name** for a malicious payload or backdoor.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs)**, including **elevated privilege abuse**, **remote execution**, and **suspicious file operations**. While some events could be benign (e.g., legitimate task creation), the **combination of threats** and **lack of clear benign context** makes this batch **highly suspicious** and **worthy of further investigation** (e.g., checking for malware signatures, network traffic analysis, and user behavior).\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Check for Malware**: Scan the system for malware, focusing on files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\`.\n2. **Investigate Remote Connections**: Review network logs for unauthorized remote access (e.g., RDP, SSH).\n3. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**: Verify the legitimacy of `estrutura_auxiliar` and `unidade_comum` tasks.\n4. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**: Investigate PowerShell scripts for obfuscation or malicious commands.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (multiple overlapping suspicious events)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events are related to Chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of them—like six entries. Now, Chrome doing registry changes isn't necessarily bad, but if it's happening repeatedly, that might be a red flag. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity alongside these.\n\nLooking further down, there's a Dns query event from Chrome.exe. DNS queries can be normal, but if they're going to unusual domains, that's a problem. However, the log doesn't specify the domain, so I can't tell yet. Then there's an event about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the path seems to be in the Downloads folder, which could be a sign of someone setting up a new tool. \n\nAnother event is from powershell.exe creating a file called \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but creating a file named like that (which translates to \"auxiliary object\" in Spanish) might be benign, but it's worth noting. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all these together: multiple registry changes by Chrome, a DNS query, and file creations by different processes. The key point is whether these activities are part of normal user behavior or something more suspicious. Since Chrome modifying the registry multiple times could indicate something like a browser hijack or malware trying to persist. But without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to be certain. The other events don't show obvious malicious activity, but they also don't confirm anything benign either.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same event (Chrome.exe registry changes) multiple times might indicate a pattern that's worth investigating. The presence of multiple processes (Chrome, PowerShell, winlogbeat) doing various actions could be part of a larger attack, but again, without more data, it's speculative. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant a closer look, but not enough to be certain. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is that there are multiple registry modifications by Chrome, which could be indicative of malicious activity, along with other file creation events that might be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe registry modification events (RegistryEvent) could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious configuration changes. Additional file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe may suggest tooling or data exfiltration activity, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
