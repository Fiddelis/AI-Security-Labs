{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? Maybe they're just browsing the web. But then there's powershell.exe showing up multiple times. The first mention is ProcessAccess, which might be normal, but then there's a whoami.exe process created. Whoami is a legitimate command to get user info, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's doing some XOR encryption on a string. The string seems to be \"Path\\n----\\nC:\\Users\\victim\", which looks like it's trying to encode a path to a user directory. Then it's sending that encrypted data to example.com via a POST request. That's suspicious because it's exfiltrating data, even if the destination is a placeholder like example.com. The use of XOR encryption might be an attempt to obfuscate the data being sent.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell, but the fact that it's loading several of them could indicate that the script is doing more complex operations. Also, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red herring, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere's a FileCreate and then FileDeleteDetected for a temporary script file. That could be part of a legitimate process, but if the file is created and then immediately deleted, it might be an attempt to hide the script's presence. The PipeCreated event might be related to inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the normal activities from chrome.exe are probably benign. However, the PowerShell activities, especially the encrypted data exfiltration, multiple image loads, and the creation\/deletion of a temporary script file, point towards potentially malicious behavior. The XOR encryption and POSTing data to a server are signs of data exfiltration, which is a common indicator of compromise. Even though some of the files loaded are legitimate, the combination of events suggests that this is worth investigating further. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.85 because there are multiple suspicious indicators that don't seem to fit normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious indicators** that suggest potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities:**\n1. **Data Exfiltration via PowerShell:**\n   - A PowerShell script is observed encrypting a string containing a user path (`C:\\Users\\victim`) using XOR and sending it to `example.com` via a POST request. This is a clear sign of **data exfiltration**, even though the destination (`example.com`) is a placeholder. The use of XOR encryption suggests an attempt to obfuscate the payload.\n\n2. **Unusual File Operations:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1`) is created in the user's Temp directory and immediately deleted. This pattern (create â†’ delete) is often used to **hide malicious scripts** or avoid detection.\n\n3. **Abnormal PowerShell Behavior:**\n   - Multiple `ImageLoad` events for PowerShell-related DLLs (e.g., `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) suggest the script is executing complex operations, possibly involving **code injection** or interaction with system components.\n\n4. **Lateral Movement Indicators:**\n   - The script's encryption of a user path (`C:\\Users\\victim`) implies an attempt to **target specific user data**, which could be part of credential theft or lateral movement.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `PipeCreated` event may indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which could be used to evade detection or coordinate with other malicious processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious:**\n- **Legitimate:** Chrome's DNS queries and network activity are normal for a browser.\n- **Suspicious:** PowerShell's actions (encryption, exfiltration, file tampering) are highly unusual and align with **malicious behavior** (e.g., data theft, persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The combination of **data exfiltration, file tampering, and obfuscation** strongly indicates a potential security incident (e.g., malware execution, insider threat, or APT activity).\n\n**Classification:** `INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence Level:** `0.85` (High)  \n**Recommended Action:** Analyze the PowerShell script's decrypted payload, check for unauthorized access, and investigate the destination server (`example.com`)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. There are a bunch of PowerShell commands here. The same command line is repeated multiple times. Let me parse what's going on.\n\nThe PowerShell script is taking a string, encoding it to bytes, then XORing each byte with a key. Then it's converting that back to a string and sending it via a POST request to example.com. That seems suspicious because XOR is a common method for obfuscating data, which attackers might use to hide the actual payload. Also, sending data to an external server like example.com could be part of exfiltrating information.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be normal, but the repeated PowerShell events are more concerning. The 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll are part of normal system operations, but the same PowerShell command being executed multiple times is a red flag. \n\nSince the same malicious-looking command is present in multiple logs, even though some have different winlog tasks, the repetition and the nature of the command (XOR encryption and exfiltration) suggest this is worth investigating. The confidence is high because the pattern is consistent and the behavior is indicative of data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell commands performing XOR encryption on user path data and exfiltrating it via POST to example.com, indicating potential data theft. Repeated execution of the same suspicious payload across multiple log entries raises strong red flags for malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit unusual because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files in startup folders might be part of persistence mechanisms. But maybe it's just a normal user activity.\n\nThen there are several entries about registry value sets. A lot of processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, etc., modifying the registry. That's common for some legitimate operations, but if it's too frequent or from unexpected processes, it could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the file creation by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation when configuring or updating settings. But the same file is mentioned twice, which might be redundant or a mistake in the logs.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Chrome loading these could be normal if it's being scanned, but if it's not expected, it might indicate some tampering. However, since Chrome is a common application, it's possible that these are legitimate.\n\nOther entries include image loaded events for urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows component. The Calculator.exe and svchost.exe entries don't stand out immediately. The Pipe Created event for chrome.exe might be part of normal communication, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. There are multiple registry modifications by various processes, which could be part of a configuration change or a malicious activity. However, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be a false positive if the user is setting up log shipping. The repetition of chrome.exe events might be normal if the user is running multiple instances or extensions.\n\nBut there's also the fact that powershell.exe is involved in file creation and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, without seeing the actual content of the files created or the specific registry changes, it's hard to determine intent.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't show clear signs of a security incident. The events are mostly related to normal operations, even though some might be a bit unusual. The confidence is moderate, but not high enough to flag it as definitely interesting. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.5, but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the file created by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a known place where PowerShell might store startup scripts. If that's a user's own script, it's fine, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of persistence. However, without knowing the user's actions, it's hard to tell. Similarly, the winlogbeat file creation might be part of a legitimate setup.\n\nOverall, the logs don't show clear malicious activity. The events are either normal or require more context to assess. Therefore, it's likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.5.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not present clear evidence of malicious activity or require immediate investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:  \n   - A file was created in the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` directory by `powershell.exe`. While this could be part of legitimate scripting or user activity, it is not inherently suspicious without additional context (e.g., unexpected commands or persistence mechanisms).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:  \n   - Multiple processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `chrome.exe`) modified registry values. These are common in both legitimate system operations and potential malicious behavior. However, no specific malicious registry changes (e.g., persistence keys, obfuscation) are indicated here.\n\n3. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**:  \n   - The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is consistent with `winlogbeat` (a log shipper) during configuration updates. This is a normal operational activity.\n\n4. **Chrome and System DLLs**:  \n   - `chrome.exe` loaded `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components). This is typical for antivirus scanning or security checks, though further analysis would be needed to confirm legitimacy.\n\n5. **Repetitive Entries**:  \n   - Multiple `chrome.exe` events (e.g., registry modifications, image loads) may reflect normal user behavior (e.g., running multiple tabs, extensions) rather than malicious activity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs contain no clear indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected binaries, network connections, privilege escalation). While some entries (e.g., PowerShell file creation, registry changes) warrant further context, they are not inherently suspicious in isolation. \n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence**: 0.5 (neutral, no definitive malicious activity detected)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. The tasks mentioned are Process accessed, Process Create, Registry value set, and Image loaded. The command lines show commands like Remove-Item with paths that have some suspicious patterns. For example, the path \"C:\\\\objeto_temporario\\\\objeto_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\registro_auxiliar\\\\pacote_padrao_script.bat\" has multiple directory jumps with \"..\", which might be trying to access parent directories, possibly to evade detection or reach a specific file.\n\nThen there's a File created event for \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" in the Downloads folder. Not sure if that's malicious yet, but combined with other activities, it might be part of something. Also, the Image loaded events point to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are legitimate system files, but loading them multiple times could be a red flag if they're being used for something unexpected.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, there are multiple Remove-Item commands with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. This could be an attempt to delete files without prompting errors, which is common in malicious scripts to clean up after themselves. The paths being deleted are in various directories, and the use of .. suggests they might be trying to delete files in parent directories, which could be a way to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, there are several events with the task 'Provider Lifecycle', which might be related to PowerShell's provider model, but combined with the other activities, it's possible that these are part of a larger script or attack. The fact that there are multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events could indicate that temporary files are being created and then deleted, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple Registry value set events might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. However, the Chrome.exe events are all about Registry value set, which might be normal if the browser is updating its settings, but the frequency might be worth checking.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Some of these events could be legitimate, like normal PowerShell usage or Chrome updates. But the combination of multiple suspicious file operations, registry changes, and the use of PowerShell commands with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore does raise concerns. The repeated deletion of files with paths that include .. might be an attempt to delete files in a way that's harder to track, which is a common technique in malicious scripts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the high number of PowerShell-related events, the suspicious file operations, the use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore, and the multiple registry changes do point towards potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential **malicious activity** or **unusual system behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Command Patterns**:\n   - **`Remove-Item` with `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore`**:\n     - Multiple commands attempt to delete files (e.g., `modulo_principal\\\\registro_logico_script.bat`) using paths with `..` (parent directory jumps). This could be an attempt to **obfuscate file paths** or **delete files in unexpected locations** without raising errors.\n     - Example:  \n       ```powershell\n       Remove-Item \"C:\\\\componente_ativo\\\\pacote_base\\\\..\\\\modulo_principal\\\\registro_logico_script.bat\" -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\n       ```\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - **Temporary files created and deleted** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1` in `AppData\\Local\\Temp`). This is common in **malware cleanup** or **script execution** to avoid leaving traces.\n   - **`estrutura_temporario.txt`** in the Downloads folder may be part of data exfiltration or logging.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Repeated `Registry value set` events** (e.g., for Chrome.exe). While Chrome may legitimately update registry keys, the **volume and context** (no clear benign purpose) could indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n4. **Image Loading of .NET Assemblies**:\n   - **Multiple `Image loaded` events** for system files like `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) and .NET components (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While these are legitimate, **unusual loading patterns** (e.g., repeated or unexpected contexts) could signal **DLL hijacking** or **misuse of legitimate processes**.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events**:\n   - PowerShell's **`Provider Lifecycle`** events (e.g., for `Remove-Item` commands) may indicate **interaction with PowerShell providers** (e.g., registry, file system). Combined with other activity, this could suggest **script-based attacks** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Red Flags**\n- **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**: Over 20 PowerShell-related events, many with **destructive or stealthy commands**.\n- **Path Obfuscation**: Use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `modulo_principal\\\\registro_logico_script.bat`) may be an attempt to **evade detection** or **access sensitive directories**.\n- **Lack of Clear Benign Purpose**: No obvious legitimate reason for the volume of file deletions, registry changes, or temporary file creation\/deletion.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Cleanup**: Deletion of files (e.g., `.bat` scripts) may be part of **post-exploitation cleanup**.\n- **Persistence**: Registry modifications could be used to **install backdoors** or **persist across reboots**.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2)**: Temporary files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) might be used for **data exfiltration** or **receiving malicious payloads**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) during these events.\n   - Investigate **user accounts** involved (e.g., `fiddelis`) for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Examine the contents of deleted files (if recoverable) or use **PowerShell transcript logging** to reconstruct commands.\n\n3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Audit the registry for **unusual entries** (e.g., startup keys, scheduled tasks) linked to the observed activity.\n\n4. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools or **antivirus scans** on affected systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and **requires immediate investigation**. The combination of **PowerShell misuse, file tampering, registry changes, and obfuscation** strongly suggests **malicious activity**. Further analysis is critical to confirm threats and mitigate risks."}

The command lines use Remove-Item with paths that have \"..\\\" which might indicate moving up directories. That could be a red flag because sometimes attackers use such paths to delete files in parent directories, possibly to cover their tracks or remove evidence.\n\nThen there's the use of sc.exe to stop and delete services. Stopping and deleting services can be part of a malicious activity, like trying to disable security software or other services that might interfere with their operations. The service names here are generic like \"objeto_temporario\" and \"estrutura_secundario,\" which don't immediately ring a bell as standard services, so that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are events related to registry value sets and process accesses. While some of these might be normal, the combination with the file deletions and service manipulations could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or hide the presence of malicious activities.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of actual malicious behavior. The logs don't show any direct access to sensitive files or obvious payloads. The whoami.exe executions are standard for checking user context, which isn't necessarily bad. The Windows Defender DLL being loaded is normal too.\n\nBut the repeated use of PowerShell to delete files across different paths and the manipulation of services do raise concerns.

That's a bit odd because deleting temporary files might be normal, but the use of \/A:H suggests it's targeting hidden files, which could be part of cleaning up after something malicious. The command is redirected to nul, which might be to hide the output. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for powershell.exe and cmd.exe related to registry value sets. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. The fact that conhost.exe is also involved in registry changes is unusual since conhost is typically a helper process for consoles.\n\nLooking further, there are several image loads from PowerShell, including .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the process is interacting with antivirus components, which could be a sign of evasion techniques.\n\nA file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory.

These could be signs of a malicious actor trying to manipulate the system, avoid detection, and execute commands.

The winlog task is 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure about that yet. Then there's a file entry as None, so maybe no file involved here.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe the process is being used for something else. Then a file created in the user's AppData folder.

PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. \n\nLooking at the files loaded, there are several .dll files from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate, but the presence of multiple image loads might be normal.

The events seem to be mostly legitimate PowerShell operations, possibly related to testing or temporary files. The deletion of the .ps1 file might be part of a normal process, like a script that's run and then cleaned up.\n\nBut wait, the fact that a file is created and then deleted quickly could be an indicator of something trying to hide its tracks.

But the fact that it's being executed multiple times might not be suspicious on its own. However, the repetition could be a sign of something if there's a pattern.\n\nNow, looking at 'powershell.exe', there are several 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But just having access events isn't necessarily bad. However, when combined with other events, it might be more telling. \n\nWait, there's also a 'Registry value set' event for 'powershell.exe'. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence mechanisms. That's a red flag. But in this case, the event is just a registry value being set. However, without more context, like what the value is or which key was modified, it's hard to say for sure. But the presence of such an event alongside multiple process accesses could indicate something.\n\nAnother thing is the 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, but the file path mentioned is a temporary YAML file. That might be part of a normal installation or configuration process. However, if this is happening in an unexpected context, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple process accesses for PowerShell, a registry event, and a file creation by Winlogbeat. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity. The 'whoami.exe' is normal, and the PowerShell accesses could be part of routine operations. The registry change is a bit suspicious, but without more details, it's hard to confirm. The Winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the repetition of the same processes and events might be a pattern. However, the justification for being interesting would need more concrete evidence. Since there's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities, maybe this isn't interesting. But the presence of registry modification by PowerShell could be a low-level indicator. However, the confidence here is low because the evidence isn't strong enough. So, maybe the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because the events don't show clear malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repetitive process access events for common tools (powershell.exe, whoami.exe) and a single legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe. No clear indicators of compromise, malicious behavior, or anomalous patterns are present in the combined dataset.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
