Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the powershell events, one entry has a command line that runs a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup.

Creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to execute something without leaving traces. \n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events might be normal, but the sheer number of events from PowerShell with those commands stands out. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell running suspicious commands, loading multiple DLLs, creating and deleting a script, and the repeated events could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any suspicious activities or patterns that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. There's a lot of PowerShell activity here. The first entry shows a PowerShell process with a task \"Pipe Created\" which might be normal, but then there's a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That looks like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups. That's a red flag because those commands are often used in reconnaissance during an attack.\n\nNext, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. However, just creating a config file might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother PowerShell process loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not an issue. But then there's a process for net.exe and net1.exe running \"net user\", which is a standard command to list users. However, the presence of both net.exe and net1.exe might be odd. Wait, net1.exe isn't a standard Windows executable. That could be a typo or a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate one. That's suspicious.\n\nThen there's a file created by PowerShell called \"pacote_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads directory. Not sure what that file contains, but the name might be in Portuguese, which could be a red herring, but without knowing the content, it's hard to say. However, the fact that PowerShell is creating a file might be part of data exfiltration.\n\nThere are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, but if it's doing so repeatedly, that might indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's just normal operations.\n\nThe updater.exe process is creating a pipe, which might be normal for communication, but the command line for updater.exe seems legitimate as part of Google's updater. However, the presence of multiple processes and the command line parameters might be okay.\n\nThe cmdkey.exe \/list command is also part of the PowerShell script, which lists stored credentials. That's a potential issue because if an attacker is listing credentials, that's a security risk.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there's \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" events with no process information. That might indicate that some system changes are happening without clear process owners, which is suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands gathering system info, presence of non-standard executables like net1.exe, potential credential listing with cmdkey.exe, and unusual registry modifications by Chrome. These points suggest that this could be a compromised system where an attacker is trying to gather information and possibly exfiltrate data. The combination of these activities makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, indicating potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance:**\n   - A PowerShell script runs commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, `ls C:\/Users`, `get-childitem`, and `net localgroup`. These commands are commonly used to **enumerate users, groups, and stored credentials**, typical in **reconnaissance phases** of attacks.\n\n2. **Unusual Executable (`net1.exe`):**\n   - A process named `net1.exe` (not a standard Windows executable) runs the `net user` command. This could indicate **malware masquerading as a legitimate tool** or a typo in the process name (e.g., `net.exe` vs. `net1.exe`).\n\n3. **Credential Enumeration:**\n   - `cmdkey.exe \/list` is executed via PowerShell, which **lists stored credentials** (e.g., Windows credentials, SSH keys). This is a **high-risk activity** if done by an unauthorized actor.\n\n4. **File Creation by PowerShell:**\n   - A file named `pacote_ativo.txt` (possibly in Portuguese, meaning \"active package\") is created in the `Downloads` directory. While not inherently malicious, **PowerShell creating files** in user directories could indicate **data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms**.\n\n5. **Unusual Chrome Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show `chrome.exe` modifying registry values. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry extensively, so this could signal **malicious tampering** or **adware**.\n\n6. **Unattributed System Events:**\n   - Events under **\"Security Group Management\"** and **\"User Account Management\"** have no associated process (`process: None`). This may indicate **unauthorized changes** to system security policies or user accounts without clear audit trails.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likely Threat:** **Reconnaissance or initial access** by an attacker seeking system details (users, credentials, file locations).\n- **Potential Impact:** **Data leakage** (via `cmdkey.exe` or file creation), **privilege escalation** (via user\/group enumeration), or **malware persistence** (via PowerShell scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Check the content of `pacote_ativo.txt` and analyze the PowerShell script for malicious payloads or exfiltration attempts.\n2. **Verify `net1.exe`:**\n   - Confirm if `net1.exe` is a legitimate process or malware. Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **Process Explorer** for analysis.\n3. **Audit Credential Storage:**\n   - Review stored credentials via `cmdkey.exe` to ensure no sensitive information is exposed.\n4. **Monitor Chrome Activity:**\n   - Investigate registry changes made by Chrome for signs of tampering or adware.\n5. **Check for Unauthorized System Changes:**\n   - Review security group\/user account modifications linked to the unattributed events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs contains **multiple red flags** consistent with **malicious activity**, particularly **reconnaissance and credential enumeration**. Further investigation is **highly recommended** to confirm if the system has been compromised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries with \"task\": \"Security Group Management\" in the winlog. But since the process and file are all \"None\", those might just be system logs or placeholders that aren't actually indicative of any activity. Maybe they're just part of the system's normal operations or maybe they're incomplete logs. Not sure yet, but maybe not the most concerning part.\n\nThen there are some entries with actual process names. Let's see. There's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are system DLLs, but SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a legitimate application, but sometimes malicious software uses similar names. However, loading system DLLs is normal, so not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's net.exe and net1.exe running \"localgroup\" commands. Net.exe is a standard Windows tool for network commands, but \"net1.exe\" might be a typo or a renamed version. However, the command \"localgroup\" is part of the net command, so maybe that's normal. But if there are multiple instances or unexpected processes, that could be suspicious. However, the presence of both net.exe and net1.exe might be worth checking, but I need more context.\n\nThen there's PowerShell.exe creating files in user directories, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and modulo_base.txt. Creating files in AppData is common, but if it's done in an unusual way or with suspicious content, that could be a red flag. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily malicious. Also, there's a registry value set event from PowerShell and conhost.exe, which might indicate configuration changes.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe process creating a file in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, so that might be normal. However, the presence of multiple file creation events from PowerShell and winlogbeat could be part of normal operations or data collection.\n\nLooking at the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process, which is a legitimate update tool. The command line mentions installing from the scheduler, which is normal for updates. The image load of taskschd.dll is also part of the Task Scheduler, so that's expected.\n\nNow, considering all these events, there's a mix of normal system processes and some that are a bit suspicious. However, none of the events seem to indicate a clear attack pattern. The repeated Security Group Management logs might be noise. The SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs is normal unless there's other context. The PowerShell activities could be part of legitimate scripting, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nBut since there's no clear malicious activity, like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or unusual network activity, the batch might not be interesting. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations might warrant further investigation. But the confidence is low because there's no concrete evidence of a threat. So, I'd say it's not interesting, but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly routine system events (e.g., process creation, file operations, registry changes) and no clear indicators of compromise. While there are some non-standard processes (e.g., SDXHelper.exe, net1.exe), they do not exhibit malicious behavior patterns like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The events appear to align with normal system operations or benign monitoring tools (e.g., winlogbeat).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
