{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through the entries.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then I see some PowerShell and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. The command lines here are a bit concerning. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that uses sc.exe to create a service with a path that looks like it's trying to execute some executable. The path includes \"modulo_geral.exe\" and \"modulo_comum\", which are in directories that seem a bit generic, maybe obfuscated? Also, the command line has a lot of spaces and equals signs, which might be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nThen there's the sc.exe process creating another service, which is suspicious because creating services can be a way to persist on a system. The services are named things like \"elemento_principal\" and \"tarefa_principal\", which again, are not standard service names. Also, the paths mentioned in the service creation don't look like typical system paths. They're in directories like \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\", which seems a bit off. Legitimate services usually have more standard names and paths.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are references to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate files, but the fact that they're being loaded by various executables might indicate that .NET applications are running. However, combined with the service creation and the use of sc.exe, this could be part of a larger attack. The presence of multiple registry value set events, especially from services.exe and sc.exe, suggests changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple entries for process access by PowerShell might indicate that someone is trying to manipulate processes or inject code. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes includes \"sc.exe create\" and \"sc.exe start\", which are used to create and start services. This is a common technique in malware to maintain persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating services with non-standard names and paths, using sc.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious command lines, along with multiple registry changes and image loads of .NET components, seems like a pattern that could indicate malicious activity. Even though some of the processes are legitimate, the overall behavior is more indicative of something trying to establish persistence on the system. So, I think this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious patterns that indicate potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`:**\n   - Multiple entries show `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` being used to **create services** with non-standard names (e.g., `elemento_principal`, `tarefa_base`) and paths pointing to executable files in atypical directories (e.g., `C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe`). \n   - **Why this is concerning:** This behavior is commonly associated with **malware persistence** (e.g., creating hidden services to maintain access to the system).\n\n2. **Obfuscated Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The `cmd.exe` command lines include obfuscated paths and parameters (e.g., `modulo_geral.exe`, `modulo_comum`), which may be an attempt to **evade detection** by hiding malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events from processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `modulo_secundario.exe` suggest **tampering with system configuration**, which could be part of **persistence or evasion techniques**.\n\n4. **Loading of .NET Runtime Components:**\n   - Multiple `Image loaded` events reference .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While legitimate, this could indicate the execution of **malicious .NET payloads** or **code injection**.\n\n5. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - PowerShell and `cmd.exe` are used in ways that deviate from typical user behavior (e.g., creating services, modifying the registry), which may signal **post-exploitation activities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat:**\n- The combination of **service creation**, **registry modifications**, and **.NET component loading** suggests **malware persistence** or **remote code execution**. The obfuscation in file paths and service names further supports this hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Check for Malicious Files:**\n   - Investigate the files referenced in service creation paths (e.g., `modulo_geral.exe`, `unidade_base.exe`) for malware signatures or anomalies.\n2. **Analyze Process Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to trace the execution of suspicious processes.\n3. **Review Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit the registry keys modified by `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` for unauthorized changes.\n4. **Network Traffic Analysis:**\n   - Monitor DNS queries and network connections from `chrome.exe` and other processes for **C2 communication** or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events exhibits **behavior consistent with malware persistence, evasion, and exploitation**. Further investigation is **highly recommended** to confirm the presence of malicious activity and mitigate potential risks. \n\n**Verdict:** üîç **Interesting for investigation** ‚Äî Likely indicators of compromise (IoCs) present."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. That seems normal if someone is installing or configuring winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. But maybe the presence of multiple file creation events could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, the same file path is mentioned twice, so maybe it's just a repeated event.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe triggering registry value set events and process access events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected registry changes, it's hard to say. The events here are generic.\n\nOther processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and calc.exe are mentioned. Some of these are standard system processes. The image load events for urlmon.dll are normal since that's a system DLL. However, the fact that 'Calculator.exe' is mentioned might be a typo (should be calc.exe?), but that's probably just a naming variation.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system operations and legitimate user activities. The repetition of file creation by winlogbeat could be part of a setup process. There's no evidence of suspicious file paths, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation. The confidence here is low because the events don't show any clear signs of an attack. So, I would classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations and legitimate process activities (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, standard registry access by PowerShell, and system DLL loading). No suspicious patterns, unusual file paths, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
