{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not immediately suspicious, but maybe part of a larger pattern. Then there's a cmd.exe command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script names are like \"NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, the script doesn't exist? That might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to execute a non-existent script, which could be a way to bypass detection or indicate a failed attempt.\n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe entry creating a task with a similar command. The file created is in the Tasks directory, which is normal for scheduled tasks, but the command line parameters are suspicious. The use of -ep bypass is a known method to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks. Also, the script paths mentioned don't exist, which could be an attempt to execute a script that's not there, possibly part of a larger attack plan.\n\nOther entries include svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry changes. Chrome's repeated registry events might be normal, but svchost.exe is a common host process for system services. However, multiple registry changes could indicate tampering. The winlogbeat.exe entries are about file creation, which might be part of log collection, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe key points here are the use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks with powershell.exe and the non-existent script paths. This could be an indicator of an attempted attack, even if the script isn't found. The combination of creating tasks with elevated privileges (using \/ru system) and bypassing execution policies suggests a possible security threat. Even though some entries might be benign, the overall pattern of creating scheduled tasks with suspicious parameters is concerning. The confidence here is medium to high because the indicators are common in attack scenarios, but there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with 'powershell.exe -ep bypass' command, non-existent script paths (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'), and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with malware execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
