{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's an unusual number, but the logs don't specify any anomalies here. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe involved in several events. Registry value sets, process creation, image loaded, file created and deleted. The command lines show Start-Process commands pointing to various .bat files. Some paths look a bit odd, like with multiple backslashes and directory traversals (e.g., ..\\\\). That could be a red flag. Also, the files being loaded include some .dlls from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender, which might be legitimate, but combined with the other activities, it's worth checking.\n\nThe file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but if it's part of a malicious payload, that's a sign. The Pipe Created event might be normal, but in combination with other events, it could indicate something.\n\nThe repeated use of Start-Process in the command lines with different paths might be an attempt to execute scripts from various locations. The paths have a pattern with \"..\\\\\" which could be trying to access parent directories, maybe to bypass some security measures or to hide the actual location of the script.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .dll files. While some are legitimate, others like MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be part of normal operations, but if there's an unusual number or unexpected modules, that's a concern.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe changing registry values. Not sure if that's normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes normal browser activities, but the PowerShell events with multiple Start-Process commands, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and loading of various DLLs could indicate a potential security incident. The repeated use of Start-Process with different paths might be an attempt to execute malicious scripts. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of events suggests something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activities**\n1. **Chrome.exe DNS Queries & Network Connections**  \n   - Routine for a browser; no immediate red flags unless correlated with malicious domains or unusual traffic volume.\n\n2. **Legitimate DLL Loads**  \n   - Modules like `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) and `.NET` assemblies are legitimate, though their presence should be contextualized.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Script Execution Patterns**  \n   - **Repetitive `Start-Process` Commands**:  \n     Multiple entries show PowerShell invoking `.bat` files from paths like `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...` and `C:\\componente_secundario\\...`. The use of `.. \\` (directory traversal) in paths may indicate attempts to obfuscate or access non-standard directories.  \n     Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     Start-Process \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat\"\n     ```\n\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory**:  \n     A temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This is common in benign scenarios (e.g., script execution), but could also mask malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**  \n   - **`ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and `PowerShell.exe`** modifying registry values. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate attempts to persist or alter system behavior.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation**  \n   - A `PipeEvent` logged for `PowerShell.exe`. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but their presence here could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Hypothesis**\n- **Script-based Attack**: The repeated use of `Start-Process` with obfuscated paths and temporary files suggests a possible **script-based attack** (e.g., lateral movement, payload delivery).  \n- **Persistence or Obfuscation**: Registry changes and directory traversal in paths may hint at **persistence mechanisms** or **obfuscation techniques** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with External Threat Intelligence**  \n   - Check if any of the invoked `.bat` files or domains in DNS queries are associated with known malicious activity.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**  \n   - Examine the content of the temporary `.bat` files (if available) for indicators of compromise (e.g., command-line arguments, encoded payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**  \n   - Investigate if the `Start-Process` commands are part of a broader network traversal or data exfiltration attempt.\n\n4. **Check for Anomalies in Registry Changes**  \n   - Validate the purpose of registry modifications by `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and PowerShell.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile some activities are benign, the **combination of PowerShell script execution, obfuscated paths, and temporary file operations** raises **moderate concern**. This batch merits **further investigation** to rule out malicious activity. **Confidence Level: 60%** (likely benign but with potential for hidden threats)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe. The majority are from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Now, the tasks mentioned are things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, Pipe Created, File created, etc. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the command_line in one of the entries: \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process \\\"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\\\"}\". That seems like a PowerShell command starting a batch file. The path here has some dots and double backslashes, which might be a way to obfuscate the path. Also, the file is in a directory named \"registro_temporario\" which might be a red herring, but the presence of a script being executed from an unusual location could be suspicious.\n\nAnother entry is \"cmd.exe \\\/c \\\"\\\"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\\\" \\\"\". Again, a batch file being executed. These scripts might be doing something malicious, like modifying the registry or executing other commands.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome might legitimately modify its own registry keys, having so many entries could indicate something's wrong. Also, there's an image loaded from \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\amsi.dll\" and \"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25030.2-0\\\\MpOAV.dll\". These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, that might be a sign of something like a malicious process trying to bypass detection.\n\nAnother suspicious point is the file created by powershell.exe at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_principal.txt\". While creating a file isn't inherently bad, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it could be relevant. Also, the svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder might be normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nHowever, there are also a lot of normal activities, like Chrome accessing the registry, which is common. The presence of legitimate processes and files might dilute the suspicious activities. But the combination of PowerShell executing batch files, multiple registry modifications, and loading of system DLLs could indicate a potential security incident. \n\nI need to weigh whether these events are part of normal user behavior or something more malicious. The fact that there are multiple registry changes and process accesses, along with the execution of scripts from potentially obfuscated paths, makes me think this is worth investigating further. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7. The justification is the suspicious command lines and multiple registry modifications that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Execution of Obfuscated Scripts:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executes a command with an obfuscated path:  \n     `C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat`.  \n     - The use of `..` in the path may be an attempt to hide the true location of the script.  \n     - The script name (`componente_padrao_script.bat`) and directory structure (`registro_temporario`, `entrada_comum`) could indicate custom or malicious tooling.\n\n2. **Unusual CMD Execution:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process runs a batch file:  \n     `C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat`.  \n     - The directory names (`entrada_ativo`, `estrutura_principal`) and script naming (`entrada_geral_script.bat`) suggest potential obfuscation or deliberate misdirection.\n\n3. **Excessive Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple entries for `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` modifying the registry. While Chrome may legitimately modify its own keys, the frequency and lack of clear context could signal tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Loading of System DLLs:**\n   - `chrome.exe` loads `amsi.dll` (Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and `MpOAV.dll` (Microsoft Defender Antivirus). While these are legitimate, their loading in conjunction with other suspicious activity could indicate evasion techniques (e.g., disabling AMSI).\n\n5. **File Creation in User Directories:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process creates a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt`. While not inherently malicious, this could be part of data exfiltration or logging.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal Activity:**\n- **Chrome and System Processes:**  \n  - `chrome.exe` modifying the registry and loading system DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) is common for legitimate operations.  \n  - `svchost.exe` creating a file in the Delivery Optimization directory is typical for Windows update processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **mixed signals**, but the combination of **obfuscated script execution**, **unusual registry activity**, and **loading of security-related DLLs** raises concerns. These patterns are consistent with **malicious behavior** (e.g., initial access, persistence, or evasion). Further investigation (e.g., analyzing the contents of the batch files, checking for lateral movement, or examining process memory) is warranted.\n\n### **Classification:**\n- **INTERESTING** (Confidence: **0.7**)  \n  - Justification: Suspicious script execution, obfuscated paths, and anomalous registry activity suggest potential compromise. Normal system behavior cannot be ruled out, but the risk is elevated."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSON objects, each representing a system event.\n\nFirst, looking at the first seven entries: they all involve chrome.exe and a registry value being set. The task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Now, Chrome is a common browser, and it's possible that it modifies the registry during normal operations, like updating settings or extensions. However, multiple registry changes from the same process might be suspicious, especially if they're all the same. But since they're all from chrome.exe and the same task, maybe it's just normal behavior. But I should note that repeated events might indicate something, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's the eighth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, part of the Elastic Stack. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal if the user is setting up the tool. However, the file name is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration. This might be a legitimate activity, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious configurations. However, without more events, it's hard to say.\n\nThe ninth event is powershell.exe creating a file named elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating a text file in the Downloads directory could be normal, like saving a document. But if this is part of a larger set of events, like downloading or executing malicious code, it might be suspicious. However, on its own, it's not clearly malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the first seven events are all from chrome.exe modifying the registry. That's repetitive but might be normal. The other two events involve file creation by winlogbeat and powershell. Since there's no obvious malicious activity, like unusual processes, network connections, or suspicious file paths, the batch might not be interesting. However, the repetition of registry changes by chrome.exe could be a red flag if it's abnormal for that process. But without more context or other suspicious events, it's not conclusive. The confidence here is low because there's not enough evidence of malicious behavior. So the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing legitimate actions (registry modifications, file creation) in typical locations (Downloads directory). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
