{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a command-line utility that displays the current user's identity. That's usually benign, but sometimes it's used in malicious contexts to check privileges.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The logs show ProcessAccess events, Registry value sets, and ImageLoad events. The ImageLoad events mention loading .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly can be a sign of a malicious script trying to execute without leaving evidence.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a PowerShell command that runs 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are used to list files recursively. This might be part of a script that's searching for something on the system. Combined with the file creation and deletion, this could indicate an attempt to run a script that's been downloaded or generated, then cleaned up immediately.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessAccess events and Registry modifications might suggest that the process is trying to modify system settings or access sensitive information. Also, the Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack here. The events are more indicative of reconnaissance or initial access attempts. Since the user is asking for classification, I need to weigh whether these activities are suspicious enough. The combination of PowerShell usage, file creation\/deletion, and registry changes does point towards potential malicious activity, even if it's not confirmed yet. Therefore, the batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and loading of .NET DLLs, which may indicate script-based attacks or reconnaissance activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. The path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpClient.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's own files are usually signed and legitimate. But maybe this is a drop-in? However, the task is 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)', which is normal for processes. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common log shipper. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Maybe it's just configuring itself, but creating a new config file could be part of setup or maybe tampering. Not conclusive yet.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event with command line 'ls -recurse' etc. That's just listing files recursively. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating 'objeto_principal.txt' in the user's Downloads. Creating a text file might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nRegistry value set events for powershell.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, etc. Registry changes can be benign or malicious. But multiple registry events from svchost and others might indicate something, but not sure yet.\n\nThere are multiple 'User Account Management' events, which could be related to account changes, but if they're just normal logins or account management, maybe not. However, the 'Special Logon' and multiple User Account Management entries might suggest some account manipulation, but without more context, hard to tell.\n\nThe same winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file multiple times. Maybe it's a configuration file being written repeatedly, which could be a sign of something trying to overwrite or tamper with the config. But maybe it's just a setup process.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: There's a mix of normal activities (like winlogbeat creating config files, powershell doing file listings) and some registry changes. However, the key point is whether there's any suspicious activity. The first event about loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory might be legitimate, but if that DLL isn't part of the usual Defender installation, it could be a red flag. However, the path seems correct for a Defender update.\n\nThe repeated creation of the same .yml.new file by winlogbeat could be a sign of something trying to modify the configuration, but if it's part of the software's normal operation, it's not suspicious. However, if it's being done multiple times, maybe there's an attempt to inject malicious configurations.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple registry events from svchost.exe and others. svchost is a common host process for services, and registry changes could be part of service updates. But if there's a lot of them, maybe it's a sign of malicious activity.\n\nBut looking again, the majority of events are from legitimate processes (winlogbeat, powershell, svchost) doing normal things like creating files, accessing processes, and changing registry values. The only potentially suspicious thing is the first event with the DLL load from Defender's path. However, that might be a false positive if the DLL is legitimate.\n\nAlternatively, if the DLL is not signed or is a different version, that could be an issue. But without more info, it's hard to tell. The other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The repeated file creation by winlogbeat could be a red herring, but maybe not.\n\nOverall, I think the logs don't show clear signs of a security incident. The activities are mostly normal for the processes involved. Unless there's something I'm missing, like the DLL being malicious or the registry changes being part of a larger attack, but based on the given data, it's not obvious. So the answer might be that it's not interesting for investigation, but I need to be careful.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate a clear security incident or malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Legitimate Processes and Activities**:\n   - **`powershell.exe`** and **`winlogbeat.exe`** performing routine tasks (e.g., file listing, configuration file creation) are consistent with normal operations. The `objeto_principal.txt` file creation and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file updates may be part of legitimate configuration management or data processing.\n   - **`svchost.exe`** and **`RuntimeBroker.exe`** registry modifications are typical for system services and user account management, especially in environments with frequent updates or user interactions.\n\n2. **Potential Red Flags (But Not Confirmed)**:\n   - The **`MpClient.dll`** load from the Windows Defender directory (`C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\...`) could be benign (e.g., a legitimate Defender component). However, without additional context (e.g., file hash verification, unexpected behavior), it cannot be confirmed as malicious.\n   - Repeated **`winlogbeat.exe`** file creation may suggest configuration tampering, but this is speculative without evidence of unauthorized changes or anomalies in the file content.\n\n3. **No Clear Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - No suspicious network activity, anomalous process behavior, or unexplained system changes are evident.\n   - The **`User Account Management`** events are generic and could relate to normal account operations (e.g., login attempts, policy changes).\n\n**Conclusion**: The logs reflect typical system and application behavior. Unless further analysis (e.g., file integrity checks, network traffic inspection) uncovers hidden threats, these events are not currently indicative of a security incident. **No immediate investigation is warranted** based on the provided data."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first event is about calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but urlmon.dll is part of the Windows system files. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But in this case, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location. So maybe that's normal.\n\nThe next two events are svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. Setting registry values could be normal, but if it's done repeatedly or in unusual ways, it might be suspicious. However, the events here are the same, so maybe it's just a regular service update. But since there are two identical entries, maybe that's a red flag? Or maybe it's just a log duplication.\n\nThe fourth event is Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard Windows process. The correct name is calc.exe. Maybe that's a typo, but it could also be a malicious process masquerading as Calculator.exe. If the process name is different (with a capital 'C'), that might indicate something's wrong. However, the file path is the same legitimate location. \n\nPutting it all together: The first and fourth events involve loading urlmon.dll, but the process names are calc.exe and Calculator.exe. The difference in process names might be a typo, but it's worth checking. The svchost.exe events are normal, but duplicates might be a sign of something. However, without more context, like unusual registry changes or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The presence of a process named Calculator.exe instead of calc.exe could be a red flag. However, since the file paths are legitimate, maybe it's just a benign process. \n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because all the file paths are legitimate, and the processes are common, even if there's a typo. But the difference in process names might be worth noting. However, without more evidence of malicious activity, like unexpected network connections or other anomalies, the batch might not be interesting. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's some ambiguity with the process name, but no clear signs of a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe) and standard system files (urlmon.dll). The process name variation ('Calculator.exe' vs 'calc.exe') appears to be a typographical inconsistency rather than a security concern, as the file paths and system activities align with normal Windows operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
