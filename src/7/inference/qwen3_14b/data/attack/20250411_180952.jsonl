{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, which is normal, MpDefenderCoreService.exe (probably part of Windows Defender), chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The first few entries are DNS queries and network connections from chrome and svchost, which might be normal browsing. But then I see some cmd.exe and net.exe commands. \n\nWait, the command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is adding a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain, and then adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts with temporary passwords sounds like a potential attack. Also, there's another command using net1.exe, which I don't recognize as a standard Windows tool. Maybe a typo or a malicious executable? \n\nThen there's the use of powershell.exe multiple times, which is common but can be abused for malicious activities. The Registry value set events might indicate changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms. Also, the file creation events include a .yml.new file for winlogbeat and a pacote_base.txt. The winlogbeat file might be part of a log shipping setup, but the presence of multiple file creations could be normal. However, the combination of user creation commands, domain admin additions, and suspicious process executions (like net1.exe) points towards a possible compromise. \n\nI should check if the user accounts being created are legitimate. The passwords have \"temporario\" (temporary) in them, which might be a sign of a temporary setup, but adding someone to Domain Admins is a big deal. Also, the use of cmd.exe with net commands to add users and groups is highly suspicious, especially if it's not part of a known administrative task. The presence of multiple network connections and DNS queries might be part of exfiltration or command and control. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the creation of domain admin accounts, the use of suspicious tools like net1.exe, multiple registry changes, and the file creations could indicate a security incident. The confidence here is high because these activities are typically associated with malicious activities such as privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via net.exe\/cmd.exe with temporary passwords, use of non-standard tools (net1.exe), repeated registry modifications, and PowerShell process access. These patterns suggest potential privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
