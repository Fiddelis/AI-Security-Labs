{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used. That's common, but sometimes they can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. There's an entry for 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes 'sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\"'. Wait, the script path is 'NonExistingScript.ps1', which might be a red flag. Also, there's another 'sc.exe' command creating a service with a similar path: 'c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. \n\nThe use of 'sc create' to set up a service that runs a PowerShell script is suspicious. Typically, attackers might create a service to maintain persistence. Also, the script names have 'NonExisting' in them, which could be a typo or an attempt to hide the real name. \n\nThen there are multiple 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration, like modifying startup entries or hiding the malware. The fact that 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are involved in registry changes might indicate something is trying to alter system settings. \n\nThere's also an event where 'calc.exe' loads 'urlmon.dll', which is a normal system file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a sign of something wrong. However, the same DLL is also loaded by 'Calculator.exe', which might just be normal behavior. \n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the presence of '.new' suggests it's a temporary file, which isn't necessarily bad. \n\nHowever, the combination of creating services with PowerShell scripts, multiple registry changes, and the use of 'cmd' and 'powershell' in ways that suggest automation or persistence is concerning. The fact that the scripts referenced don't exist (NonExisting) might be an attempt to avoid detection, or maybe it's a typo. \n\nI should also check if there are any other red flags. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate tool, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. \n\nPutting it all together, the presence of service creation with PowerShell, multiple registry modifications, and the use of non-existent script names points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of a Windows service with a PowerShell script path containing 'NonExistingScript.ps1' (likely a typo or obfuscation), 2) Frequent registry modifications by system processes, 3) Unusual use of 'sc create' command with PowerShell scripts, 4) Multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, which is often used in attacks.\",\n  \"MITRE_TACTICS\": [\"Persistence\", \"Defense Evasion\"],\n  \"RECOMMENDATIONS\": [\"Investigate the 'NonExistingScript.ps1' references\", \"Check for unauthorized registry changes\", \"Monitor service creation activities\", \"Analyze PowerShell script execution patterns\"]\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are eight entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with no file involved. That's a lot of registry changes by Chrome. But Chrome does modify the registry during normal operations, like updating settings or extensions. However, multiple registry changes might be normal depending on the context.\n\nThen there are two more entries where chrome.exe is involved in \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" events. The files are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files. Loading these DLLs could be part of normal antivirus operations. But why would Chrome load them? Maybe it's a false positive, or maybe there's something else going on. However, these are signed Microsoft files, so that's a good sign.\n\nNext, there's an event with powershell.exe and a \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" task. No file path is given here. Process access events can be normal, but if it's a high-privilege process or accessing sensitive areas, that might be suspicious. However, without more details, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: Chrome making multiple registry changes might be normal, but the image loads of Defender DLLs are legitimate. The PowerShell event is a bit concerning but not enough on its own. However, all events are from legitimate processes and don't show obvious signs of malicious activity. The lack of other suspicious events and the presence of legitimate files might mean this isn't interesting. But the high number of registry changes by Chrome could be a red flag. However, I'm not sure if that's enough to classify as interesting. Maybe the confidence is moderate, but the justification would be that while there are multiple registry changes, they are from a legitimate process and the other events involve known good files. So perhaps it's not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) and known good files (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). Registry modifications by Chrome are consistent with normal operation, and no suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
