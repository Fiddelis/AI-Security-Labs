{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if there's any malicious activity. Let's start by going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial event is about DiscordSetup.exe being created from the Downloads folder. That's a normal installation process, right? People often download setup files from the internet. Then, there's an ImageLoaded event for the same executable. That seems standard too.\n\nNext, the logs show that Update.exe is created in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used for Windows application updates, so this might be part of a legitimate update process. The command line for Update.exe includes --install, which is typical during installation. Then, several ImageLoaded events for Update.exe and various .NET DLLs. Again, this could be part of a normal installation, especially since .NET components are common in applications.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of ProcessAccessed events for Update.exe. The rule here is ProcessAccess, which might indicate that the process is accessing other processes or resources. But since Update.exe is part of the Squirrel update framework, maybe this is just part of the update process. However, the high number of ProcessAccess events might be a red flag. Typically, during an installation, you might expect some process interactions, but if there are too many, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the files are being created in AppData\\Local\\Discord and other directories, which is where applications usually store their data. The presence of files like app-1.0.9190\\Discord.exe suggests that it's an update to Discord, which is a legitimate application. However, the fact that the installer is using Squirrel and creating multiple files and processes might be a bit more involved than a standard install.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the logs are from a batch that needs to be analyzed as a whole. Let me check again. The first process is DiscordSetup.exe, which is a legitimate installer. Then Update.exe is created, which is part of Squirrel's update mechanism. The multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs are part of the application's dependencies. The ProcessAccess events might be part of the update process, but if there's an unusual number, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the events don't show any signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, file deletions, or attempts to modify system settings.\n\nAlso, the final event shows that Discord.exe is created and run with the --squirrel-install flag, which is part of the installation process. The ImageLoad for Discord.exe is also normal. There's no mention of any suspicious files or processes being executed, or any unexpected behavior.\n\nHmm, but maybe the sheer number of ProcessAccess events is a bit concerning. However, considering that Squirrel is a legitimate framework, and the events align with a standard update process, it's possible that this is just a normal installation. The absence of any other suspicious indicators like unexpected network traffic, registry changes, or execution of unknown binaries makes me think this is not malicious.\n\nSo, the conclusion would be that this batch of events is not interesting because it aligns with a legitimate software update process. The confidence might be around 0.7 because while the number of events is high, they all fit within normal installation activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events aligns with a **legitimate software update process** for Discord, utilizing the **Squirrel framework**, which is commonly used for Windows application updates. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Legitimate Installation Flow**:\n   - **DiscordSetup.exe** and **Update.exe** are standard components of Squirrel-based installers. The presence of `--squirrel-install` in the command line confirms this is part of an update process.\n   - **ImageLoad** events for `.NET` DLLs are typical for applications relying on the .NET runtime.\n\n2. **ProcessAccess Events**:\n   - While there are multiple **ProcessAccess** events for `Update.exe`, these are likely part of the Squirrel framework's internal operations (e.g., interacting with system resources during installation). No suspicious behavior (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected process interactions) is observed.\n\n3. **File Locations**:\n   - Files are created in standard directories like `AppData\\Local\\Discord`, which is consistent with application updates.\n\n4. **No Red Flags**:\n   - No evidence of **malicious activity** (e.g., unexpected network connections, file deletions, registry modifications, or execution of unknown binaries).\n\n**Conclusion**: The events represent a **normal update process** for a legitimate application. The high volume of events is due to the complexity of the Squirrel framework, but no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **0.7** (Moderate). While the events are not suspicious, the number of **ProcessAccess** events could raise questions in some contexts, but they are justified by the Squirrel framework's typical behavior."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. There's a lot of ImageLoad events, which is normal for a process to load its own DLLs. For example, Discord.exe loading ffmpeg.dll and its own executable. Also, there are Pipe Created events, which might be part of normal communication within the application. The command line arguments for Discord.exe include typical parameters like --type=crashpad-handler and some GPU process flags, which seem legitimate.\n\nThen there's the Update.exe process. It's creating a shortcut and using .NET libraries like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Loading these .NET DLLs is normal for an updater application. The command line for Update.exe also looks standard for an update process.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual activity. Are there any unexpected files being loaded? The paths are all within the Discord application directory or standard Windows directories. No mention of suspicious files or network activity. The Pipe Created events are repeated, but that's common for applications that use named pipes for inter-process communication.\n\nWait, the same ImageLoad events for ffmpeg.dll and Discord.exe are repeated multiple times. But that might just be multiple instances of the process starting up. Also, the Update.exe is part of the Discord installation, so it's expected during an update.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation. All the processes are related to Discord's normal operations. The classification here is probably NOT INTERESTING because all activities are within the bounds of normal application behavior. The confidence is high since there's no red flags detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events relate to normal Discord application behavior, including legitimate process creation, image loading of expected DLLs (e.g., ffmpeg.dll), and standard .NET framework components during updates.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. The initial entries for Discord.exe seem normal—like process creation, image loading, and access. The command line arguments look like typical ones for a legitimate application. Then there's the loading of DLLs such as ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, and libGLESv2.dll. These are common libraries used by applications, especially for media and graphics processing. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nHowever, then there's a lot of activity related to Update.exe. The first occurrence is a file created in the Start Menu Programs folder for Discord Inc, which might be part of a legitimate update process. But then there's a Discord.lnk shortcut created on the desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but the frequency here is high—there are multiple entries of Update.exe accessing the process and creating files. The repetition of \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe could indicate something unusual. \n\nWait, but why so many ProcessAccess events? Maybe it's just normal operations, but the sheer number might be a red flag. Also, the fact that Update.exe is creating multiple shortcuts and being accessed repeatedly could be a sign of a malicious process trying to persist or spread. However, I need to check if these are all legitimate. For example, some of these might be part of a normal update process, but the repetition might not be. \n\nAnother point is that the first event for Discord.exe has a long command line with various flags. Some of the flags like --disable-features might be normal, but others could be suspicious. However, without knowing the exact context of the features being disabled, it's hard to say. The presence of --secure-schemes and --cors-schemes might be part of the application's configuration. \n\nI should also consider the combination of events. The fact that both Discord.exe and Update.exe are involved, with Update.exe creating multiple files and being accessed a lot, might indicate a potential compromise. However, I need to be careful not to assume malicious intent without more evidence. \n\nBut the key here is that the system is generating a lot of events related to Update.exe, which might be a legitimate updater, but the high frequency of ProcessAccess events could be a sign of something wrong. Alternatively, it could just be a noisy legitimate process. \n\nIn the absence of clear indicators like unexpected network activity, unusual file modifications, or known malicious hashes, it's a bit tricky. However, the repeated creation of shortcuts and the high number of access events might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to warrant looking into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show repeated 'Process accessed' events for 'Update.exe' (21 occurrences) and multiple file creation events (e.g., Discord.lnk shortcuts on desktop and Start Menu).

The presence of both Discord.exe (normal application) and Update.exe (potential malicious payload) warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"Medium\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Discord.exe is loading some DLLs like libEGL.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and vk_swiftshader.dll. These are legitimate files for Discord, especially since they're in the AppData directory. So far, nothing suspicious here. Those are normal dependencies for a Discord application.\n\nThen there's an event where Update.exe creates a shortcut in the Start Menu and on the desktop. That's a bit odd. Why would Update.exe be creating shortcuts? Typically, updates shouldn't create shortcuts unless it's part of the installation process. But the fact that it's creating a shortcut in multiple locations might be a red flag. However, I need to check more events.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. A lot of them—like 14 instances. That's a lot of process accesses. Usually, such a high number of access events could indicate something malicious trying to interact with the system or maybe a process that's being monitored heavily. But I need to see if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nThen there's a reg.exe process adding an entry to the Run key in the registry, pointing to Update.exe with a parameter to start Discord.exe. That's a classic sign of persistence. Malware often adds itself to the Run registry key so it starts automatically when the user logs in. The command line here is reg.exe adding HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the value pointing to Update.exe. That's definitely suspicious because it's creating a persistent mechanism.\n\nAnother reg.exe event adds a registry entry under Software\\Classes\\Discord, setting a URL protocol handler. This could be part of a legitimate application, but combined with the previous registry modification, it might be an indicator of a malicious payload. The URL protocol handler could be used to launch the application when a user clicks on a Discord link, which could be a vector for attacks.\n\nThe multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal, but when combined with the registry changes and the shortcut creation, it's a different story. Also, the fact that Update.exe is creating multiple shortcuts and modifying the registry to persist could indicate that this is not a normal update process.\n\nPutting it all together: The legitimate Discord processes are running, but the Update.exe is doing a lot of suspicious activities—creating shortcuts, modifying the registry for persistence, and having multiple process access events. The combination of these events suggests that this might be a malicious activity trying to install itself persistently on the system. Even though some of the files are legitimate, the behavior here is not normal for an update process. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Update.exe creating multiple shortcuts in user directories, 2) reg.exe modifying registry to add persistence (HKCU\\\\Run key), 3) Unusual number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe, and 4) Registry modifications for URL protocol handler.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to Discord.exe. There are several instances of \"Pipe Created\" and \"Process accessed\" events. But then there are some reg.exe commands modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That seems a bit suspicious because modifying registry keys, especially those related to file associations, can be part of malware behavior. For example, changing the default icon or the command that's executed when a Discord URL is opened might be an attempt to hijack the protocol or set up persistence.\n\nAlso, there's an \"Update.exe\" process creating a shortcut in the Start Menu. While creating shortcuts isn't inherently malicious, if it's done by an unexpected process, it could indicate something's wrong. The fact that Update.exe is involved here might be a red flag, especially if it's not part of a legitimate update process.\n\nLooking at the command lines for reg.exe, they are adding registry entries for Discord's URL protocol, default icon, and the command to open it. These changes could be part of setting up a custom handler for Discord URLs, which might be benign if done by the actual Discord application. However, since these changes are made by reg.exe, which is a legitimate tool, but the context here is important. If this is part of a normal installation or update, it's okay. But if it's happening without user consent or in an unusual context, it's suspicious.\n\nThe multiple \"Pipe Created\" events might indicate that Discord is creating named pipes for communication, which is normal for some applications. However, excessive or unusual pipe creation could be a sign of something else. But in this case, since it's Discord.exe, which is a known application, it might just be part of its normal operation.\n\nAnother thing is that the \"Update.exe\" process is loading DLLs and creating files. The image loaded events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll might be normal, but the presence of Update.exe in the logs could be part of an update process. However, the combination of registry changes and file creation by Update.exe might be worth investigating further.\n\nI should also check if there are any anomalies in the process tree or unexpected parent-child relationships. But from the given data, it's hard to tell without more context. However, the registry modifications and the creation of a shortcut by Update.exe could be part of a larger attack, like a dropper or installer that's modifying the system to persist or change behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of multiple registry modifications by reg.exe and the activities of Update.exe might indicate a potential security incident. Even though some actions are normal for legitimate software, the combination and the context here could be suspicious.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about \"Update.exe\" with tasks like ProcessAccess, FileCreate, RegistryEvent, and ProcessTerminate. There's a FileCreate event where a Discord.lnk shortcut is created on the desktop. That might be normal, but creating a shortcut isn't necessarily bad. However, the repetition of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe multiple times could be a red flag. Usually, if a process is accessed many times, it might be part of a larger operation, like trying to inject code or maintain persistence.\n\nThen there's the Registry value set event. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration. Also, the ProcessTerminate for Update.exe might indicate that the process is being killed after doing something, which could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the Discord.exe events, there are multiple ProcessCreate and ImageLoad events. The command lines for Discord.exe include parameters like --type=crashpad-handler and --url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e. The URL here is suspicious because \"f.a.k\/e\" looks like a placeholder or a fake domain. That might be a sign of phishing or malicious activity. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and its dependencies (like ffmpeg.dll) could be normal, but if those DLLs are not standard or are loaded from unexpected paths, that's a problem.\n\nAnother thing is the combination of Update.exe activities with Discord-related processes. Maybe Update.exe is a legitimate updater, but if it's creating shortcuts, modifying the registry, and then Discord is involved with suspicious URLs, that could indicate a chain of events where malware is using legitimate software as a vector.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility that this is just normal software behavior. For example, Discord might legitimately create shortcuts and have multiple processes. But the high number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe and the suspicious URL in the command line parameters lean towards being interesting.

The command line for the process creation seems normal, with standard parameters. The user might be concerned if there's any suspicious activity, but all the loaded files are part of the Discord application. The repeated \"Process accessed\" events might be normal as well, maybe part of the application's operations.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any anomaly.

The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to Discord.exe. There are multiple entries of \"Process accessed\" and \"Pipe Created\" events. Normally, Discord is a legitimate application, but the frequency of these events might be a red flag. However, I should check if there's anything unusual in the details.\n\nLooking closer, there's an entry involving reg.exe, which is a Windows utility for modifying the registry. The command line shows that it's adding a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. The command is adding a URL protocol association. While this could be part of Discord's normal installation, I need to check if this is done in an unusual way or if there are other suspicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the \"Image loaded\" events. One of them points to ffmpeg.dll being loaded by Discord.exe. Ffmpeg is a common library for multimedia, so that might be normal. However, if the file path is unexpected or if there are other unusual DLLs, that could be a problem. Here, the path seems to be within the Discord installation directory, which is likely legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the batch should be analyzed as a whole. There are multiple instances of ProcessCreate for reg.exe and Discord.exe. The reg.exe commands are modifying the registry to associate the Discord protocol with a URL. This could be normal, but if this is happening in a context where the user hasn't installed Discord or if there are other signs of tampering, that's a concern.\n\nAlso, the repeated \"Process accessed\" events might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. However, if it's just regular activity, that's normal. But since there's no other suspicious activity like network connections to unknown IPs, file modifications, or privilege escalation, maybe it's not a threat.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses could be part of a malicious activity, especially if the user didn't initiate the installation. But without more context, like if the user is a regular user and Discord is not supposed to be installed, or if there are other logs indicating compromise, it's hard to say.\n\nIn this case, since the logs only show Discord-related activities and registry changes that are somewhat normal for an application, maybe it's not interesting. But the repeated events might be a sign of something. However, I think the justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity here.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: reg.exe is adding a registry key for Discord's DefaultIcon. That seems normal because applications often modify the registry for their icons. But then there are multiple entries about Discord.exe creating pipes. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but having multiple pipe creations might be a red flag. However, Discord is a legitimate application, so maybe that's just part of its normal operation.\n\nNext, there's another reg.exe event adding a command for the shell open, which is also typical for setting up how the application is launched. Then, there are several NetworkConnect events. Discord being a communication app would naturally have network connections, so that's expected. The DnsQuery events are also normal for any application accessing the internet.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the Discord.exe processes, it's launching with various parameters, including some that look like they might be related to unzipping or handling media. However, the presence of --secure-schemes and other flags might be standard for the application's functionality. \n\nThere's an ImageLoad event for ffmpeg.dll. FFMPEG is a common library for multimedia handling, so that's probably legitimate. The FileExecutableDetected event points to a Widevine CDM DLL in the Temp folder. Widevine is used for DRM, and it's common for browsers and apps to use it. However, the Temp directory might be a concern if the file wasn't expected, but since it's part of the unpacking process mentioned in the command line, it might be legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are related to normal operations of Discord, like setting up registry entries, creating pipes for communication, network connections, and loading necessary DLLs. The only potentially suspicious thing is the multiple PipeCreated events, but since Discord is a legitimate app, this might be part of its normal functioning. There's no indication of malware or unusual behavior here. The events don't show any signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. \n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't seem to be interesting for investigation.
