{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, so that might not be a problem. But the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them multiple times could be normal if the process is doing something that requires those libraries. However, I should check if there are any other unusual activities.\n\nThen there's taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler. That seems normal too. Services.exe having a logon event is standard. The special logon event with no process might be something, but maybe it's part of a user login or a service starting up.\n\nNow, looking at the DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. Multiple DNS queries could indicate the process is communicating with external servers. If it's a legitimate application, that's okay, but if it's malware, it might be contacting command-and-control servers. However, just DNS queries alone aren't conclusive. Need to see if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nThen there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably normal if they're setting up monitoring. The temporary file created by PowerShell is deleted afterward, which might be part of a script execution. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved is common but can sometimes be a red flag if it's used for malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal for PowerShell. The file creation and deletion in the Temp folder could be part of a legitimate script, but if it's part of a malicious activity, that's a concern. However, the logs don't show any actual malicious commands or unexpected network traffic beyond the DNS queries.\n\nThe repeated DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe might be worth investigating. If that process is known to be legitimate, it's probably okay. But if SDXHelper.exe is a suspicious or unknown application, those DNS queries could be a sign of data exfiltration or communication with malicious servers. However, the logs don't provide the domain names being queried, so I can't confirm that.\n\nOther events include registry changes by svchost.exe and Explorer.EXE, which could be normal system operations. The Provider Lifecycle events from PowerShell are probably part of normal operations as well.\n\nPutting it all together: the main points of interest are the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe and the PowerShell activities. However, without more context, like the domains involved or other suspicious behaviors, it's hard to say for sure. But the fact that SDXHelper.exe is performing multiple DNS queries and the PowerShell script creating and deleting files might be indicative of something. However, since the logs don't show clear signs of exploitation or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. I'd lean towards being cautious and suggesting further investigation into the SDXHelper.exe's network activity and the PowerShell scripts, but the evidence isn't conclusive yet. So maybe this is a low to medium priority for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal system activities and potential areas for further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal\/Expected Behavior**\n1. **System DLL Loads**: \n   - `SDXHelper.exe` loading `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll` is typical for legitimate applications requiring COM or internet-related functionality.\n   - `taskhostw.exe` loading `taskschd.dll` is part of the Task Scheduler service.\n\n2. **PowerShell Operations**:\n   - Loading .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) is standard for PowerShell execution.\n   - File creation\/deletion in `%TEMP%` (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is common for script testing or policy enforcement.\n\n3. **Log Events**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a log file is expected for log shipping.\n   - `Provider Lifecycle` events during PowerShell sessions are part of normal operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Areas for Investigation**\n1. **Repetitive DNS Queries**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` performs **multiple DNS queries**. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate:\n     - **Command-and-control (C2) communication** if the queries point to suspicious domains.\n     - **Legitimate traffic** if the application is a known, trusted software (e.g., a game or media player).\n   - **Action Needed**: Correlate DNS query destinations with threat intelligence feeds or check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a known legitimate application.\n\n2. **PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - The temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and deleted. While this could be part of a **script policy test** (e.g., by Microsoft Defender), it’s also a common tactic in **malicious scripts** to avoid leaving traces.\n   - **Action Needed**: Review the script’s content (if available) and check for signs of obfuscation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - The **`Special Logon` event** with no associated process might indicate a **service or user authentication event** that requires further context (e.g., is it tied to a user login or a scheduled task?).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Risk Level**: **Low to Medium**. The logs do not show clear evidence of compromise (e.g., exploit activity, unauthorized access, or malicious payloads). However, the repetitive DNS queries and PowerShell script behavior warrant closer examination.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`**: Check its reputation via antivirus tools, file hashes, or process tree analysis.\n  2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: If the script content is available, inspect it for malicious intent (e.g., use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`, or `DownloadString`).\n  3. **Correlate DNS Traffic**: Use network logs to determine if the DNS queries point to known malicious domains or unexpected locations.\n\nIf no further suspicious activity is found, these events may be benign. However, the combination of repetitive DNS queries and PowerShell scripting could indicate a **false positive** or an **early-stage threat** requiring deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple PowerShell.exe processes with the task \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These might be normal, as PowerShell is commonly used. But I should check for any unusual patterns. Then there's an entry where PowerShell loads \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe if there were other unexpected DLLs, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a process called HxTsr.exe that sets a registry value. Hmm, HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. That might be suspicious. Then there are several Python-related processes: py.exe and python.exe creating processes and loading DLLs. Some of these are standard, like vcruntime140.dll, but others like libffi-8.dll might be part of Python's dependencies. However, the presence of multiple Python processes could be normal if someone is running scripts.\n\nAnother point is the repeated DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. If that's a legitimate application, maybe not. But if SDXHelper.exe is unknown or if there are multiple DNS queries to suspicious domains, that could be an issue. However, the logs here don't specify the domains, so that's a maybe.\n\nThere's also winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But if there's unexpected activity here, like writing to unusual locations, that's a concern. However, the path seems standard for a config file.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious parts are HxTsr.exe (unusual process name) and the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe. However, without more context on the domains or other malicious activities, it's not definitive. The rest of the events seem to be normal system and application processes. So, maybe this is a low confidence interesting case, but not high enough to be certain. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because of the unusual process names and repeated DNS queries, even though they might be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: HxTsr.exe (unusual process name) modifying registry, repeated DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe (potential exfiltration), and PowerShell processes with lifecycle events (possible malicious automation). Python process tree appears legitimate but could be part of a larger attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
