{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if there's any malicious activity going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is loading system DLLs like combase.dll, urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate Windows system files, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe loading them? Hmm, maybe that's normal, but I should check if there's any unusual pattern here. But the same DLLs are loaded multiple times, but that's not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an entry for rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll. That seems normal too, as rundll32 is used to run DLLs. The command line looks like it's part of a standard operation, maybe related to some COM object. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But maybe the path is a red flag? The file is .yml.new, which could be part of an update or setup. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs, including mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, and the Defender's MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The .NET DLLs are also standard for Excel. But why so many image loaded events? Maybe just part of Excel's normal operation when opening a CSV file. The user opened a real_values.csv, which might be legitimate.\n\nThere are multiple entries about User Account Management and some Registry value sets by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Those are common system processes, so unless there's a specific registry change that's suspicious, it might not be an issue. The task \"User Account Management\" is vague, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is creating a new process and loading wmiutils.dll, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. That's normal for WMI operations.\n\nNow, looking for any anomalies. The SDXHelper.exe is loading system DLLs, but those are standard. The same DLLs are loaded multiple times, but that's not unusual. The EXCEL.EXE events seem normal. The winlogbeat file creation is part of a legitimate process. The User Account Management events don't have specific details that indicate a problem.\n\nWait, but what about the process with name \"SDXHelper.exe\"? Is that a known legitimate process? I'm not sure. If it's a third-party application, maybe. But the name doesn't ring a bell. However, the fact that it's loading system DLLs multiple times isn't necessarily malicious. Unless there's a pattern of loading non-system DLLs or from unexpected paths. In this case, all the paths are standard system directories.\n\nAnother thing to check is if there are any processes that are not expected. For example, the process with name null in some entries, but those are probably just logs where the process name wasn't captured or is part of the system. The \"Logon\" and \"Special Logon\" events might be part of normal user sessions.\n\nOverall, I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal system operations, even though some processes and events are common in attacks. But without more context or specific indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unusual file modifications, or processes not typically found), it's hard to flag this as suspicious. The user might need more information or deeper analysis, but based on the given logs, it's probably not malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** loading system DLLs (e.g., `combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) is consistent with normal operations, as these are standard Windows components. Repeated loading of system DLLs is not inherently suspicious.\n   - **`rundll32.exe`** and **`WmiPrvSE.exe`** executing commands with system DLLs (e.g., `shell32.dll`, `wmiutils.dll`) aligns with typical Windows management tasks.\n\n2. **Excel-Related Activity:**\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** loading DLLs like `mscoree.dll` (for .NET), `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender), and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) is expected when processing files (e.g., opening `real_values.csv`). No anomalies in file paths or unexpected DLLs are noted.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Configuration:**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file in the user's Downloads directory is consistent with a log shipper updating its configuration. No signs of tampering or unauthorized modifications.\n\n4. **User Account Management Events:**\n   - Multiple entries with tasks like **\"User Account Management\"** and **\"Special Logon\"** are common during user sessions. No specific registry changes or security-related flags (e.g., privilege escalation) are highlighted.\n\n5. **System Processes:**\n   - **`svchost.exe`**, **`RuntimeBroker.exe`**, and **`services.exe`** performing routine operations (e.g., registry updates, logons) are typical for Windows services and user sessions.\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Mitigated by Context):**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a widely recognized system process, but its activity here does not involve non-system DLLs, unexpected network connections, or privilege escalation. Without additional context (e.g., unusual file locations, process behavior), this alone is not conclusive.\n- **`DnsQuery`** by **`EXCEL.EXE`** could be normal for file-related operations (e.g., resolving domain names in the CSV), though further investigation would be needed if the query targets suspicious domains.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect **normal system and application behavior**. No clear indicators of compromise (e.g., malware, unauthorized access, or anomalous network activity) are present. However, deeper analysis (e.g., checking process origins, network traffic, or file hashes) would be required to confirm benignity if `SDXHelper.exe` or other components are untrusted.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not Suspicious** â€“ No actionable threats detected in the provided logs."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, both are from EXCEL.EXE creating a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. That's a shortcut file. Now, the Recent folder in Office is typically used to store recent files, but creating a shortcut there might be normal. However, the name \"real_values.csv\" could be a red flag if it's supposed to be a CSV file but is actually a shortcut. Maybe someone is trying to disguise a malicious file as a legitimate one.\n\nThen there are three entries with process, winlog, and file all set to null. Those might be incomplete or error logs, but they don't provide much info. However, the presence of multiple null entries might indicate some logging issues, but not necessarily malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are three DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. Excel usually doesn't perform DNS queries unless it's connecting to some online service or there's a macro involved. If the DNS queries are to suspicious domains, that would be a concern. But the logs here don't specify the domains, so I can't confirm that. However, the fact that Excel is making multiple DNS queries might be unusual and warrant further investigation.\n\nPutting it all together: creating a shortcut in the Recent folder might be normal, but combined with DNS queries from Excel, it could indicate something like a macro trying to communicate with a C2 server. The shortcut could be a lure to open a malicious file. However, without more info on the DNS domains or other suspicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence isn't extremely high, but the combination of file creation and DNS queries from Excel is enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple EXCEL.EXE processes creating a suspicious shortcut file (real_values.csv.LNK) in the Office Recent folder, combined with subsequent DNS queries from the same process, suggests potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
