{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. A lot of them are about image loading, which is normal because PowerShell often loads various DLLs. However, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. That seems suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nThen there's the event where PowerShell is run with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which is a red flag. Bypassing execution policies can allow scripts to run even if they're not signed or approved, which is common in malicious activities. Also, the file 'teste.ps1' is created and executed. While creating a script file isn't inherently bad, combining it with bypassing execution policies raises concerns.\n\nAnother point is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events. Although they might be normal, the high number could indicate something unusual. However, the main suspicious activities are the file creation and deletion, and the use of bypassed execution policies. The presence of these events together suggests potential malicious behavior, even if individual events aren't conclusive. So, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities: file creation\/deletion (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1), execution policy bypass, and potential script execution (teste.ps1).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell.exe with ImageLoad events. The files loaded are mostly .dlls related to .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there's an entry where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. \n\nAlso, there's a Registry value set event, which could be part of configuring something, but not necessarily bad. The last event is about executing a remote command, but the process is null here. That might be a red flag, but I need to check if that's part of the same process or a separate event.\n\nWait, the first event is Process accessed, then several ImageLoads, then the file creation and deletion. The user might be trying to run a script temporarily, then delete it. But why would PowerShell load all those .NET DLLs? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it's a bit odd. Also, the remote command execution event might be related, but the process is null here, which could be an indicator of something malicious, like a remote code execution without a clear process.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of loading multiple system DLLs, creating and deleting a temporary script file, and a remote command execution event could indicate an attack. The confidence is medium because while some events are normal, the combination of actions might be suspicious. But I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Maybe the user is just running a script that's legitimate. However, the deletion of the file after creation is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes loading .NET Framework DLLs (normal behavior) combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion and a remote command execution event suggests potential malicious activity, such as script-based attacks or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
