This could indicate that the process was communicating with an external resource before it was closed.\n\n3. **RuntimeBroker.exe Registry Value Set:**\n   - RuntimeBroker.exe set a registry value. This is likely related to Windows 10's runtime broker, which manages app execution and background tasks.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat.exe Process Creation and Activities:**\n   - winlogbeat.exe was created from the downloads folder where it was presumably extracted.\n   - It loaded its executable file and created a new NDJSON log file in its logs directory (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs).\n   - No process access or termination events were recorded for winlogbeat.exe.\n\n5. **Powershell.exe Access:**\n   - powershell.exe accessed another process, but no further details are provided about the target process or the type of access granted."}
