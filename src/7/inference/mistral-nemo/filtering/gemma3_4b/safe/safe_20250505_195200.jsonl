The hash values at the end of each file name suggest that these files might be cached or compiled versions, with different content depending on the user's Office configuration or the Office version itself.\n\nSince there are multiple instances of the same hash (e.g., `ae065c48251e7598bbfce3bcfcb9cbd3`), it might indicate that either:\n\n- The file was created twice due to some error or retry mechanism.\n- The files are being shared or accessed by multiple users or processes simultaneously.\n\nTo gain more insights, consider checking the timestamps of these events and observing any patterns in the creation of these files. Also, monitoring other related processes or events could provide additional context for why these files are being created repeatedly."}

These are probably minified JavaScript files used by the Office AI Copilot feature.\n\n3. **Location**: The files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n\n4. **Behaviors**:\n   - The process is creating multiple files with similar names, differing only in the `<HASH>` portion (which likely represents unique content or versioning).\n   - Each creation event is logged separately, suggesting that these files might be created one by one, possibly due to an update or dynamic loading process.\n\n5. **Potential Concern**: If this activity is causing significant system resources usage or performance issues, it might indicate a problem with the Office application or its AI Copilot feature. However, based solely on this log, the activity appears normal for updating offline files used by the Office AI Copilot."}
