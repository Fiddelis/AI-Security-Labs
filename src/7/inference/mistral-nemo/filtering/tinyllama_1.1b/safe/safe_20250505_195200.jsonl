The `SDXHelper.exe` process, which is associated with Microsoft Office products, is creating JavaScript files (`excel-copilot-strings.js`) in the following directories:\n\n   - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d...`\n   - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8988909c18d...`\n\n   These JavaScript files are likely used for Office's scripting or customization features. The fact that multiple instances of these files are being created (as seen by the duplicate hashes) could indicate some form of replication, error, or intended behavior related to Office updates or add-ins.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons for this activity:\n\n- **Office Update**: Microsoft Office products regularly update their components and features. These logs might be associated with such an update process.\n- **Add-in\/Extension**: The creation of these JavaScript files could be due to the installation, update, or configuration of an Office add-in or extension.\n- **Corruption\/Recovery**: In some cases, Windows might recover or recreate certain files if it detects corruption or issues. This could potentially lead to duplicate files being created.\n\nIf this behavior is unwanted and causing issues (like high disk I\/O or increased Office application resource usage), it would be recommended to investigate the Office processes' configuration and check for any pending updates or problematic add-ins\/extensions. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance."}

This behavior is normal and shouldn't cause concern unless there are unusual aspects like excessive file creation leading to performance issues or disk space exhaustion."}
