However, without additional context or investigation, it's not possible to determine if this is indeed an issue.\n\nTo further investigate, you may want to check:\n- What process created these files (other than `SDXHelper.exe`, which only seems to be creating them)?\n- Are there any other unusual activities or errors around the same time?\n- Were any files modified or deleted after creation?"}
