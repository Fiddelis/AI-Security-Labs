{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"These logs appear to be related to file creation activities by a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". Here's a breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Process Name:** The process involved is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which might be associated with Microsoft Office, as it's creating or modifying files in the local app data folder for Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **File Creation:** The logs indicate that this process is continuously creating new files. Each log entry represents the creation of a new file with a unique hash (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.js`) in the following directory:\n\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\n   ```\n\n3. **File Content:** The filenames suggest that these are minified JavaScript files, possibly related to Office's AI features (e.g., \"officeaicopilot-strings\").\n\n4. **Duplicate Files:** Some of the logs indicate that duplicate files with the same hash and filename are being created in rapid succession. This could potentially lead to disk space issues over time or other unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **Other Process Activity:** There are also some interspersed logs indicating other activities, such as registry modifications (seen in the \"winlog\" field), which might suggest that this process is not solely focused on file creation.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check if any recent updates or installations have been made to Microsoft Office.\n- Monitor the system for any unusual resource usage or behavior changes.\n- Consider reaching out to Microsoft support or consulting their official documentation if these activities seem abnormal or are causing issues."}

This could be a process related to Microsoft Office or some other software.\n\n2. **Task**: The task being performed by this process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means the process is creating new files.\n\n3. **Files Created**: The process is creating multiple instances of two JavaScript files:\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` (or `.min.js` file)\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js.map`\n\n4. **Location**: These files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n\n5. **Frequency**: It seems like the process is creating these files in pairs (one `.min.js` and one `.min.js.map`) repeatedly, as shown by the duplicated file hashes.\n\n6. **Potential Issue**: The repeated creation of these JavaScript files might indicate an issue or misconfiguration with your Microsoft Office software or a related application. It could be due to a bug, corrupted data, or an incorrect setting."}
