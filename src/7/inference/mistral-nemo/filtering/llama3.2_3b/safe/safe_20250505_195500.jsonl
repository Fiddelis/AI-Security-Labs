This indicates that new files are being created or detected by the system.\n\n3. **File Path:** The file path points to a directory under the user's AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office folder, specifically under SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. These are the locations where Microsoft Office-related files and cache data are stored.\n\n4. **File Names:** The file names follow a pattern of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\". This suggests that these are minified JavaScript strings related to the Office AI Copilot feature in Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Office.\n\n5. **Duplicate Entries:** Some entries are duplicated, suggesting that the same file was created or detected twice, possibly due to a system bug or an error in the tool used.\n\n6. **Security Group Management Entry:** There's one entry with \"task\" as \"Security Group Management\", but without any process name or file path, which seems incomplete or unrelated to the other entries.\n\nIn summary, it appears that Microsoft Office is creating or detecting multiple minified JavaScript files related to the Office AI Copilot feature.

These files are likely part of Microsoft Office's package for offline use. There were duplicates created, possibly due to an error or intended caching mechanism:\n   - 24 unique `.min.js` files were created.\n   - Some files were duplicated, such as `officeaicopilot-strings.min_94649010c84dbf22dae304c33369015e.js`.\n\n2. **Chrome Downloads**: The process `chrome.exe` created a temporary file (`ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp`) in the user's Downloads folder.
