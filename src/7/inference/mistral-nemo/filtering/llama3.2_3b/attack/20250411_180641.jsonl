It starts with suspicious network connections from chrome.exe, followed by the creation of whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes with unusual command lines. These processes then create and execute csc.exe to compile a potentially harmful CS file. This is followed by the creation of an executable file and its loading into memory by uncommon process names like componente_comum.exe and tarefa_base.exe. The batch concludes with powershell.exe being accessed repeatedly, which could indicate further command-and-control activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
