Its usage here aligns with expected behavior when working on projects involving version control.\n\n2. **File Paths**: The paths are consistent with typical development setups where libraries like Cypress and Lodash (part of Node.js ecosystem) might be used. These libraries have numerous configuration or definition files, which match the patterns observed in the logs.\n\n3. **Task Description**: The task \"File created\" under rule \"FileCreate\" is a standard operation for version control systems when new files are added or existing ones are modified and committed to a repository.\n\n4. **Behavioral Consistency**: There are no anomalies such as unusual file locations, unexpected process activity, or signs of malicious operations (e.g., known malware executables).\n\nGiven these factors, the batch represents normal system behavior during software development activities and does not warrant further investigation for security concerns. The confidence level is high due to the clear alignment with expected usage patterns of `git.exe`."}
