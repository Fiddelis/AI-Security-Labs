The sequence starts with 'cmd.exe' executing 'schtasks' to create a task scheduled under the system account (a common tactic for persistence), followed by querying the created task. Additionally, 'powershell.exe' being accessed could be related to this attempt. These events collectively point towards an effort to execute or prepare a script in a manner that may bypass security measures.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
