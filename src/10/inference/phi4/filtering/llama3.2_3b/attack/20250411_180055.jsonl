A process named 'Calculator.exe' loaded a DLL from 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32', which could indicate a potential exploit or malware using a legitimate system file for malicious purposes. Additionally, there are several instances of registry value modifications by 'chrome.exe', suggesting possible persistence mechanisms or configuration changes aimed at facilitating unauthorized access or behavior alteration.
