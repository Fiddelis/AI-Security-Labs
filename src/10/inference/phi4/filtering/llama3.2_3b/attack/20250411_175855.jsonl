The repeated process creation of `winlogbeat.exe` with file creation logs might indicate log tampering. There are also multiple registry value set events by various processes including `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `chrome.exe`. These patterns, combined with the presence of scripts and executable commands typically associated with malicious behavior, warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
