These activities may indicate an attempt to execute or manipulate scripts, which are often associated with malicious behavior. Additionally, the creation of multiple files by `winlogbeat.exe` could be benign but warrants further inspection due to its timing with PowerShell activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
