PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute scripts stealthily.\n\n2. **Obfuscation Techniques**: The command line involving XOR-based encryption for the string `C:\\\\Users\\\\victim` suggests an attempt to hide sensitive information or actions from detection, which is typical in malware execution.\n\n3. **Network Activity**: Although initiated by `chrome.exe`, network connections are frequently involved in data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication, especially when paired with other suspicious activities.\n\n4. **File Manipulation**: The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1`) is indicative of techniques used to avoid detection by security tools.\n\n5. **Overall Pattern**: The combination of these events suggests coordinated actions that are typical in post-exploitation phases, such as maintaining persistence or exfiltrating data.\n\nGiven these points, the batch warrants further investigation due to its potential association with malicious activities."}
