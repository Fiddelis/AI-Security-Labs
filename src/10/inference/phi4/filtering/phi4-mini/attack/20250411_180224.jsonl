This suggests an attempt to load and potentially execute malicious scripts in a manner designed to evade detection. Additionally, the repeated creation of registry values by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`, alongside file creations using `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe`, may indicate further suspicious activities or misconfigurations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
