This includes setting up autorun entries with potentially malicious executables (e.g., 'estrutura_principal.exe', 'pacote_temporario.exe'), which are indicative of persistence mechanisms. The use of winlogbeat.exe to create a file in an unusual manner may also suggest tampering for exfiltration or logging purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
