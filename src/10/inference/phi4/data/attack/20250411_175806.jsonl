The use of commands like 'cmd.exe' to modify the registry startup entries is indicative of potential malware behavior aiming for persistence. Additionally, file creation events involving executables and logbeat configuration files in non-standard locations raise concerns about data exfiltration or tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
