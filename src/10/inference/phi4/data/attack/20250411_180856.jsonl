The use of 'powershell.exe' accessed multiple times could indicate scripting for automation or evasion, a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs). The execution of 'whoami.exe', especially if not from its usual location, might be used to gather system information by an attacker. Additionally, the 'Registry value set' event by 'svchost.exe' could suggest privilege escalation attempts, as legitimate tasks typically do not require setting registry values. Lastly, a 'Special Logon' with no associated process indicates unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
