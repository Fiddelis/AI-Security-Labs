This can be indicative of malware attempting to hijack or alter application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Registry Modification:** The use of `reg.exe` to add entries for a 'Discord Protocol' is atypical and suspicious, as it could indicate an attempt to create or modify URL schemes that Discord doesn't natively support. This behavior can be associated with malicious activities such as phishing or redirection attacks.\n\n- **Frequent Pipe Events:** Multiple instances of pipe creation events by `Discord.exe` suggest potential inter-process communication (IPC) which might be used for command and control operations or data exfiltration, especially if the pipes are not part of normal Discord operations.\n\n- **Process Access Monitoring:** Repeated process access events for `Discord.exe` without additional context could indicate attempts to gather information about running processes or tamper with their execution state, both common tactics in malware behavior.\n\nOverall, these activities combined warrant further investigation as they deviate from typical user or application behavior and align with patterns seen in certain types of malicious software. The confidence level is high but not absolute due to the potential for legitimate customization or extensions within Discord's ecosystem."}
