The presence of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` alongside multiple file creations, particularly `entrada_logico.txt` and the winlogbeat configuration files, raises suspicion of potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. The frequent access to processes and registries suggests probing or configuration manipulation. Furthermore, the loading of AMSI, wbem, and other system DLLs by `tasklist.exe` is not inherently malicious, but combined with the other activities makes the batch more suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
