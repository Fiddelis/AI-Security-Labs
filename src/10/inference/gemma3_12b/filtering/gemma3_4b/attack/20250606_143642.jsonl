{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data. This appears to be a sequence of events likely associated with a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n**1. Initial Execution & Reconnaissance:**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe`:** The script likely starts with a call to `whoami.exe`. This is a common technique to determine the user context under which the script is running - a basic reconnaissance step.\n*   **`powershell.exe`:** The main process starts with the execution of PowerShell.\n\n**2. Data Exfiltration and File Manipulation**\n*  **`powershell.exe` with `Remove-Item`**:  This is a critical line. It demonstrates the script is attempting to delete a file. The command `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` uses PowerShell's `Remove-Item` cmdlet to forcibly delete all files ending in `.zip` within the temporary directory (`$env:Temp`).  This is a strong indicator of cleanup - the script is trying to remove traces of itself.  The file name `entrada_principal.zip` suggests a potentially downloaded archive containing malicious components.\n*   **Creation and Deletion of a Test Script:** The script creates and immediately deletes a PowerShell script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the user's AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp directory. This is a tactic sometimes used to bypass PowerShell execution policies.  The script likely attempts to briefly test the execution policy before running the actual malicious code.\n\n**3. DLL Loading (Indicates PowerShell Scripting):**\n\n*   The `powershell.exe` process loads several DLLs:\n    *   `mscoree.dll`:  The core .NET runtime DLL. This is almost always used if a PowerShell script uses .NET objects or calls .NET methods.\n    *   `mscoreei.dll`:  Another .NET runtime DLL.\n    *   `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`:  A DLL for PowerShell's management automation features.\n    *   `clr.dll`:  The Common Language Runtime (CLR) DLL.\n    *   `MpOAV.dll`: A DLL associated with Microsoft Windows Defender (platform), which may indicate attempt to evade detection.\n\n**Summary & Assessment:**\n\n*   **Malicious Activity:** This sequence of events strongly indicates malicious PowerShell activity. The deletion of a downloaded `.zip` file and testing execution policies are tell-tale signs.\n*   **Cleanup:** The script is actively attempting to clean up after itself. This is a common tactic to avoid detection and complicate forensic analysis.\n*   **Potential Payload:**  The downloaded file `entrada_principal.zip` is highly suspicious. It likely contains the actual malicious payload.\n*   **Evasion Attempts:** The script potentially attempts to evade detection, utilizing Windows Defender platform DLL.\n*   **Further Investigation Required:**  It is essential to investigate the origin of this activity.  This means looking at:\n    *   **Execution Source:** How was the PowerShell script invoked?  Was it from a scheduled task, a phishing email, or some other mechanism?\n    *   **Downloaded File:** If possible, attempt to recover the `entrada_principal.zip` file (if it wasn't completely deleted). Analyzing its contents would reveal the nature of the malicious payload.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Affected System:**  Immediately isolate the system to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Scan with Updated Antivirus:** Perform a full system scan with an up-to-date antivirus solution.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Tighten PowerShell execution policies to restrict the ability to run unsigned scripts.\n4.  **Monitor System Activity:**  Implement continuous monitoring for suspicious PowerShell activity.\n5.  **Investigate the Source:** Determine the origin of the PowerShell script to prevent future infections.\n6.  **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**  Check for any persistence mechanisms that the malware might have installed (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry modifications).\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A more comprehensive investigation would require examining other log sources and system artifacts."}
