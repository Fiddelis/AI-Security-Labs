The scripts reference non-existent files (e.g., `c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which may indicate an attempt to obfuscate the true target. Repeated creation and querying of a scheduled task named 'win32times' further raises suspicion.  While other benign events are present (Chrome, winlogbeat), the scheduled task creation and PowerShell execution bypass flags warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
