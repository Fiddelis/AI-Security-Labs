The task names appear to follow a naming convention (\\\"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\\\", \\\"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\\\", etc.), which suggests automated or scripted behavior. Additionally, file creation events related to scheduled tasks are observed. The repeated use of `svchost.exe` in conjunction with registry modifications also warrants investigation. While `calc.exe` itself is not inherently malicious, its consistent presence within scheduled tasks raises concerns about potential persistence mechanisms or obfuscation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
