Specifically, repeated DNS queries from 'SDXHelper.exe' coupled with PowerShell process creation and multiple DLL loads (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll) suggests a possible scripting or malware execution. The creation of a temporary PowerShell script file also raises concern. The unusual DLL loads into PowerShell warrant further investigation to determine their origin and purpose.
