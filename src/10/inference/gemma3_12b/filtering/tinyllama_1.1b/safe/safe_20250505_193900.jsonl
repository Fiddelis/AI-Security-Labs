The loading of DLLs by chrome.exe, including taskschd.dll, and the creation of pipes by various processes are also noteworthy. The unusual svchost command lines (-k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted\/LocalSystemNetworkRestricted, -p, -s NgcCtnrSvc\/NgcSvc) warrant investigation as they could be indicative of malicious activity or unusual legitimate processes. The Google Updater process creation with a command line including a crash handler and attachment path suggests potential tampering or monitoring. Finally, winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory is suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
