Powershell's file creation, the use of systeminfo.exe and reg.exe queries suggest information gathering. The repeated registry modifications across various processes are also suspicious. Additionally, the winlogbeat installation and subsequent file creation, combined with chrome.exe's numerous registry modifications, warrants investigation. The amsi.dll loading by both systeminfo.exe and chrome.exe could indicate attempts to evade detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
