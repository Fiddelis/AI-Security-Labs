Multiple events involve `powershell.exe` executing commands, including enumeration of users and groups, and attempts to load DLLs commonly associated with exploitation. A temporary PowerShell script is created and immediately deleted, suggesting an attempt to evade detection. Furthermore, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Security Group Management' tasks along with `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands are suspicious. These actions are indicative of reconnaissance and potential credential harvesting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
