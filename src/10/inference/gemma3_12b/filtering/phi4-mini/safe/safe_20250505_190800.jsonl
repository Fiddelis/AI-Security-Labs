Specifically, the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts (e.g., '__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1', '__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1'), registry modifications, and multiple Image Loads (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll) suggest script execution and potential code injection.  The execution of a script with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` further raises suspicion. The repeated PowerShell Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events, along with file creations and deletions, warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
