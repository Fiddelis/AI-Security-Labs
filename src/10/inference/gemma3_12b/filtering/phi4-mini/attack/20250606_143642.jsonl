{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The sequence of events reveals a malicious PowerShell script execution, likely part of an attack. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, categorized by phase and highlighting key suspicious activities:\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Entry & Preparation**\n\n*   **Dism Operations (DLLs and WIM):**  The `Dism.exe` process is being used.  `Dism` is a Windows System Image Management tool.  The attacker is deleting several DLLs (WimProvider.dll, etc.) from a temporary location. This is unusual and strongly suggests an attempt to disable or remove legitimate system components. This is likely to avoid detection or to modify the Windows environment.\n*   **PowerShell Initialisation:** `PowerShell.exe` is invoked.  The initial use is a standard `Process Create` event which is benign in itself.\n\n**Phase 2: Stealth & Configuration**\n\n*   **`whoami.exe`:**  This command is run to determine the current user's identity.  This is typical reconnaissance for an attacker to understand the privileges and context they've landed in.\n*   **PowerShell Script Execution (StartupProfileData):** A PowerShell script creates a file in `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\config\\\\systemprofile\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. This location is associated with persistent configuration that executes upon system startup, effectively ensuring the malicious script will run again on reboot.  The \"NonInteractive\" component means this configuration isn't tied to a specific user session.\n*  **File Deletion (Zip File):** A PowerShell script is executed with the command `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`.  This is a critical sign of cleanup. The script deletes a zip file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the temporary directory. This indicates a file was initially downloaded or used in the attack but is now being removed to cover tracks. The `-Force` parameter ensures deletion without prompting.\n\n**Phase 3: .NET and Persistence**\n\n*   **.NET Loading:** The PowerShell process loads several .NET libraries (`mscoreei.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`). This suggests the malicious script is written in or relies on .NET for its functionality.\n*   **Registry Modification:** A `Registry value set` event linked to `services.exe` suggests the attacker might be manipulating system services to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) & Summary**\n\n*   **Unusual Dism Activity:** Deletion of DLL files associated with Windows Imaging.\n*   **Startup PowerShell Configuration:**  `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\config\\\\systemprofile\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` â€“ a key persistence mechanism.\n*   **File Deletion of `entrada_principal.zip`:**  Indicates downloaded or previously used malicious files are being removed.\n*   **.NET Usage:** The use of .NET libraries points to a potentially sophisticated script.\n*   **Registry Modification:** Modification of service configurations.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis is a clear indication of a sophisticated attack. The attacker is attempting to avoid detection by cleaning up after themselves, establishing persistent execution via PowerShell startup configuration, and potentially modifying system services. The use of .NET also suggests the attacker possesses a reasonable level of scripting expertise. Immediate action to isolate the affected system, scan for malware, and investigate further is crucial.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the compromised machine from the network.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus\/anti-malware tools.\n3.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Preserve the system's state for forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the attack.\n4.  **Examine PowerShell History:** Check PowerShell history logs for any other suspicious commands executed.\n5.  **Review Registry:** Examine the registry for any modified keys or values related to services or PowerShell.\n6.  **Patch Systems:** Ensure all systems are patched against known vulnerabilities.\n7.  **Strengthen PowerShell Security:**  Implement PowerShell security best practices, such as restricted execution policies and monitoring.\n8.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Implement or improve EDR capabilities for enhanced threat detection and response."}
