The use of `sc.exe` to create services and the creation of custom executables, combined with PowerShell activity, strongly suggests potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or the deployment of malware. Additionally, the naming conventions of the created executables ('elemento_principal', 'modulo_comum') suggest a structured deployment.
