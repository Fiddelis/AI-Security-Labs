{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log file appears to document a malicious PowerShell script execution. Let's break down what's happening.\n\n**High-Level Summary:**  The script is designed to delete files, modify registry values (potentially disabling security features), and attempt to remain undetected.  It's likely part of a larger attack chain aiming to establish persistence or exfiltrate data.  The script has been renamed to make it harder to detect.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown (Chronological Order with Analysis):**\n\n1. **`whoami.exe` Execution:** This is standard reconnaissance. The script is identifying which user it's running as.\n2. **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`:** This command sends out the \"Final result: 1\" and likely indicates the PowerShell script has reached the end, signaling an apparent success of some kind.  It's a simple output for the attacker to monitor if the script ran.\n3. **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:** *Critical!* This is the script’s attempt to clean up after itself.  It's deleting a ZIP file (`entrada_principal.zip`) located in the temporary directory. This strongly suggests a downloaded or uploaded malicious archive. The `-Force` parameter prevents prompts and confirms the file is deleted even if read-only.\n4. **`powershell.exe` script creation:**  The script then creates a file named `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` in the PowerShell startup directory. This is very suspicious and likely aimed at ensuring the script will execute every time the user logs in or the system starts. It likely contains additional malicious PowerShell code.\n5. **`powershell.exe` registry modification:** `Registry value set`. Registry modifications are often used to disable security features, change system behavior, or establish persistence.  Without knowing *which* value was set, it's impossible to determine the full impact, but this is a key indicator of malicious activity.\n6. **`powershell.exe` Image Loading (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll):** These are standard .NET framework DLLs. The script uses .NET functionality and components.\n7. **`powershell.exe` Deletes `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:** The removal of this file is a likely attempt at obfuscation to hide evidence of the script’s execution.\n8. **`powershell.exe` Loads Defender DLL:** The script loads Defender DLL to avoid detection.\n\n**Key Suspicious Indicators and Actions:**\n\n*   **File Deletion (entrada\\_principal.zip):**  Clean-up of a potentially malicious archive, likely downloaded earlier.\n*   **Registry Modification:** Likely disabling security or establishing persistence. This is a *critical* area for further investigation.  It's vital to determine what value was set.\n*   **PowerShell Startup File Creation:**  Ensuring the script re-runs on subsequent logins or system restarts.\n*   **File Deletion (obfuscation):**  Removing evidence of the script’s execution.\n*   **.NET Framework DLLs:** .NET frameworks provide functionality for the attacker to carry out their actions.\n*   **PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass:** The script runs despite being restricted.\n*   **Defensive Evasion:** The script attempts to avoid detection by Defender DLL\n\n**Recommendations for Response:**\n\n1.  **Isolate Affected Systems:** Immediately isolate any systems showing these logs from the network to prevent further spread.\n2.  **Analyze the Deleted File (entrada\\_principal.zip):** If possible, attempt to recover the deleted ZIP file and analyze its contents. This would reveal the specific malware being deployed.\n3.  **Examine the Registry Modification:**  Determine the exact registry value that was modified.  This is vital to understanding the impact.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:** Ensure PowerShell execution policies are appropriately configured to restrict script execution.\n5.  **Investigate Scheduled Tasks\/Startup Items:**  Check for any newly created or modified scheduled tasks or startup items that might be executing the malicious PowerShell script.\n6.  **Monitor System Behavior:** Continuously monitor affected systems for any unusual or suspicious activity.\n7.  **Review User Accounts:** Review recently created, modified, or enabled user accounts to determine if any have been compromised.\n8.  **Antivirus\/EDR:**  Run full scans with updated antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.\n9.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Consider a full forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the scope of the attack and identify the initial point of entry.\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided log snippet. A full investigation would require significantly more information. The provided information is a first step towards recognizing this is a malicious PowerShell script and responding appropriately.  A security expert should perform a thorough analysis."}
