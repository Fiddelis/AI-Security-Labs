Multiple .exe files (e.g., `estrutura_ativo.exe`, `modulo_secundario.exe`) are loaded, suggesting possible execution of dynamically compiled or injected code. The frequent registry modifications and process creation events combined with .NET framework DLL loading are concerning, potentially indicative of malware activity or unauthorized scripting.
