The deletion of a PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1`) after execution is suspicious. Additionally, numerous registry modifications by different processes indicate potential configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. The sequence of events, combined with the use of PowerShell, and the script deletion, points towards potentially malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
