While seemingly benign (using Compress-Archive), the repetitive nature and consistent use of similar file paths suggest a potential automated process, possibly for data exfiltration or archiving malicious payloads. The presence of a Notepad process modifying a registry value, combined with the activity involving winlogbeat, adds further complexity and warrants investigation.
