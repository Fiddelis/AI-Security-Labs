The tasks are named 'win32times' and the scripts reference non-existent file paths, suggesting an attempt to conceal the script's location. Multiple entries confirm the attempt, and the `whoami.exe` call may be related to privilege escalation. The file creation events for winlogbeat and powershell scripts suggest a possible data exfiltration or further execution of malicious code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
