The repeated use of `whoami.exe` along with the file searches and powershell\/cmd executions suggests reconnaissance and potential data exfiltration attempts. The file creation events involving `winlogbeat` and a `tarefa_geral.txt` file require further investigation. Although some events appear benign (e.g., calculator, Chrome), the combination and frequency of malicious indications warrants a deeper investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
