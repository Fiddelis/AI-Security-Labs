{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log data appears to document a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, potential risks, and what to look for in the future:\n\n**Overall Summary: Malware Execution**\n\nThe log sequence strongly suggests a multi-stage malware attack leveraging PowerShell. The script likely attempted to download, unpack, and execute a malicious payload, then attempts to clean up its tracks.  The specific intent is unknown without further analysis of the scripts involved, but the behavior is characteristic of malicious activity.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Events:**\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Execution (`powershell.exe`)**:  The first PowerShell instance seems to be the entry point, receiving a complex encoded command. This is a red flag, as legitimate PowerShell commands are rarely this convoluted. It's likely obfuscated to evade detection.\n2. **Service Activity (`services.exe`, `svchost.exe`)**: These are normal system processes.  Their presence doesn't directly indicate malicious activity *on their own*, but their involvement can be exploited by malware (e.g., a malicious service started or manipulated).\n3. **Sppsvc.exe & Task Scheduler Interaction:** `sppsvc.exe` relates to Software Protection Services. The event \"Image loaded\" along with `taskschd.dll` suggests an attempt to leverage Windows Task Scheduler for persistence or delayed execution. Malware often uses Task Scheduler to re-run itself after a reboot.\n4. **File Downloads & Unpacking (`powershell.exe`)**: The script is downloading and unpacking (likely from a remote server). The `Remove-Item` command indicates an attempt to delete the downloaded file to cover its tracks.  The `file` information (`entrada_principal.zip`) points to a compressed archive.  This is a highly suspicious action.  The remote location where this file was pulled from would need to be investigated.\n5. **Script Policy Test (`powershell.exe`)**:  The lines involving `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` indicate the script is attempting to bypass PowerShell's execution policy. Malware often tries to set the execution policy to 'Bypass' which allows unsigned scripts to run. The file creation and immediate deletion is a common tactic to evade detection.\n6. **DLL Loading (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`)**: These are Microsoft .NET Framework DLLs. Malware frequently uses .NET to execute code due to its flexibility and potential for obfuscation.  `MpOAV.dll` relates to Windows Defender, and the loading of this DLL alongside other .NET components might be part of a technique to interfere with Defender's functionality, although this requires further investigation.\n\n**Key Risks & Concerns:**\n\n* **Malware Persistence:** The use of Task Scheduler (evident from `sppsvc.exe` and the DLLs) is a strong indicator that the malware is attempting to establish persistence and re-run itself after a system reboot.\n* **Data Exfiltration:**  The downloaded zip file (`entrada_principal.zip`) could contain malware designed to steal sensitive data (credentials, documents, etc.).\n* **System Compromise:**  The malware could provide an attacker with remote access to the system or allow them to install further malicious components.\n* **Defense Evasion:** The script's obfuscation and attempt to manipulate Windows Defender indicate a deliberate effort to avoid detection.\n\n**Recommendations & Remediation Steps:**\n\n1. **Isolate the Infected System:**  Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread.\n2. **Full System Scan:** Perform a comprehensive scan using reputable anti-malware tools.  Update definitions *before* scanning.\n3. **Review Task Scheduler:** Carefully examine all scheduled tasks to identify any suspicious entries.  Disable or delete any tasks that appear malicious.\n4. **Examine PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Check the current PowerShell execution policy using `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.  Ideally, it should be set to `Restricted` or `AllSigned`.  If it's set to `Bypass`, revert it to a more secure setting.\n5. **Analyze the Downloaded File:** If you can recover the downloaded `entrada_principal.zip` file (even a partial copy), submit it to a malware analysis service (like VirusTotal or Hybrid Analysis) to determine its contents and purpose.\n6. **Check System Logs:** Examine system logs (Windows Event Logs) for any other suspicious activity related to PowerShell or other processes.\n7. **Implement Security Controls:**\n    * **PowerShell Restriction:**  Implement PowerShell restrictions, such as Constrained Language Mode, Script Block Logging, and Module Logging.\n    * **Application Whitelisting:** Implement application whitelisting to allow only approved applications to run.\n    * **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious attachments or clicking on links from untrusted sources.\n8. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** If not already in place, consider implementing an EDR solution to provide enhanced threat detection and response capabilities.\n\n\n\n**To provide a more specific analysis and recommendations, please provide:**\n\n* **The full PowerShell command executed initially.** (If possible to retrieve)\n* **Any information about the source of the PowerShell script.** (Email, website, etc.)\n* **Any unusual network activity observed on the system.**"}
