Notably, a PowerShell script `teste.ps1` is created and executed, with a bypassed execution policy. A temporary script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1` is also created and then deleted, potentially indicating a script policy bypass test. Several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events are also logged by powershell.exe, which is frequently used for malicious activity. The creation and deletion of temporary files also warrants investigation. While some events are benign (Winlogbeat file creation), the overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity or at least a suspicious user attempting to circumvent security controls.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
