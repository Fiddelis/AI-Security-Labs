While they might be benign, they could also indicate unwanted advertisement tracking or potential malicious scripts.\n- **Normal\/Low Risk (GREEN):** These events are typical for a game like Solitaire. The `.archive` files likely contain game assets and data necessary for its functioning.\n- **Low Impact (YELLOW):** A DNS query from Solitaire.exe is not unusual, as it might be checking for updates or communicating with online services. However, it's still worth keeping an eye on the domains involved to ensure they're legitimate and not excessive in number.\n\n**CONFIDENCE LEVEL:** Medium to high confidence in these classifications based on typical game behavior and expected file types."}
