This could be related to Microsoft Office, given the directory path.\n3. **File Content:** Since these are minified JavaScript files (`.min.js`), they likely contain strings used by Office products in offline mode.\n4. **Directory Location:** The files are located under the `OfflineFiles` directory within the `SolutionPackages` folder of Microsoft Office, suggesting that these files might be used when Office is running in offline or reduced functionality mode.\n\n**Security\/Caution:**\nWhile the events logged here seem benign (creating JavaScript files), it's always a good practice to be cautious with any file creation activities, especially those related to software installed on your system. Always keep your software up-to-date and consider scanning these files with an antivirus solution if you're unsure about their origin or purpose."}

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Process Involved**: The process named `SDXHelper.exe` is involved in this activity.\n\n2. **Task**: The task performed is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means new files or possibly modifications to existing files are happening.\n\n3. **Files Affected**: The files affected are all variations of `officeaicopilot-strings.min` with different hashes appended, suggesting these are potentially minified JavaScript files.\n\n4. **Location**: The files are located in a path under the user's local app data for Microsoft Office (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`).\n\n5. **Repetition**: The logs show repeated creation of these files, suggesting that this process might be running on a loop or triggered frequently.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n- **Legitimate Process**: If this is a legitimate and necessary process (e.g., part of Office's functionality or an update), then there might not be any cause for concern. However, the repetitive nature could suggest it's a performance optimization gone wrong or perhaps a bug.\n\n- **Malware**: On the other hand, if this is malicious activity, it could potentially indicate a malware infection that's trying to modify your system files or introduce new files into your system.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n1. Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process by searching online for its file path and digital signature.\n2. Scan your system for any potential malware using up-to-date antivirus software.\n3. Monitor the process using tools like Process Explorer (by Microsoft Sysinternals) to see what files it's interacting with and whether it's communicating with other processes or the internet.\n4.
