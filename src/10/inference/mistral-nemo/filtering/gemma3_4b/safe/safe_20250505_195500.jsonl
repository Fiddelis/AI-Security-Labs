This could indicate that Chrome has been installed or updated, as it might need to write values to the registry for its own configuration or to manage extensions.\n\n3. **Process Involved:**\n   - The `SDXHelper.exe` process is involved in creating these files. `SDXHelper` is a component used by Microsoft Office and other applications for managing add-ins and extensions.\n   - Additionally, `chrome.exe` is seen setting a registry value, as mentioned earlier.\n\nIf you're seeing excessive or repeated file creation events like these, it might be indicative of an issue with the Office add-in or extension. You could try the following steps to troubleshoot:\n\n- Disable any recently installed Office add-ins or extensions temporarily to see if the events stop.\n- Check if there are any error messages or warnings associated with these events in the Event Viewer (you can access this via `eventvwr.msc`).\n- Run a virus\/malware scan on your system, as excessive file creation could also be indicative of malware activity.\n- If you're using Microsoft 365, consider reaching out to their support or checking their official forums for similar issues and solutions."}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **File Creation**:\n   - The process is creating multiple files with names in the format `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`. The `<hash>` seems to be a unique identifier for each file.\n   - These files are located in the following directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n\n2. **File Deletion**:\n   - Almost immediately after creating each file, the process deletes it.\n   - This is inferred from the fact that there are no subsequent logs indicating that any of these files have been opened or used for any purpose.\n\nThis behavior could indicate a few things:\n\n- **Temporary Files**: The process might be using these files temporarily to store some data and then deleting them after use. However, the immediate deletion suggests that they're not being used for long.\n\n- **Corrupted or Unnecessary Files**: If the process is repeatedly creating and deleting these files, it could be a sign of corruption or unnecessary file operations. This could potentially impact system performance over time.\n\n- **Malicious Activity**: While less likely given the context, repeated file creation and deletion can also be a characteristic of malicious software trying to evade detection by constantly changing its \"footprint\".\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Identify the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". Check if it's a legitimate Microsoft process or something else.\n2. Monitor the activity of \"SDXHelper.exe\" using tools like Process Explorer ( Sysinternals suite from Microsoft) to understand why it's creating and deleting these files.\n3. If you find that this behavior is unnecessary or harmful, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support if it's a Microsoft process, or running a malware scan if it's not.\n\nFor now, I'd recommend keeping an eye on this activity and seeing if it impacts your system's performance or stability in any way. If it does, further investigation would be warranted."}

Here are some observations:\n\n1. **Process Name**: The process responsible for creating these files is \"SDXHelper.exe\". This suggests that the operation might be related to Microsoft Office products, as \"Office\" is often associated with SDX (Microsoft's internal software development kit).\n\n2. **File Names**: The filenames start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\", followed by a unique hash, and end with \".js\". This implies that these are minified JavaScript files related to some Office-related component named \"OfficeAiCopilot\".\n\n3. **Creation Time**: Since all the logs have the same timestamp (2021-07-09T14:58:16Z), it suggests that all these files were created within a very short duration, possibly at once.\n\n4. **Location**: All the files are being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" subfolder of some Office-related package. This could indicate that these files are intended to be used when Office is running offline or in a disconnected state.\n\n5. **Duplicate Files**: Some filenames appear multiple times, suggesting that there might have been attempts to recreate those specific files, possibly due to errors or retries.\n\nIf you're seeing these logs and experiencing issues with Microsoft Office, it might be worth looking into whether these files are causing any problems, perhaps by corrupting your Office installation or causing conflicts. You could try deleting these files and observing if the issue persists, but please ensure to backup important data before performing such operations. It's also a good idea to reach out to Microsoft Support for further assistance if you're unsure about how to proceed."}
