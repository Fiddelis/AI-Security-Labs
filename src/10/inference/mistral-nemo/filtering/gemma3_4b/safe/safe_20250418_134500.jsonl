This suggests that Winlogbeat, a log shipping agent for the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), was started.\n   - The process created an NDJSON log file (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`).\n\n4. **PowerShell Process Access:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process accessed another process, but the details are not provided.\n\nBased on these events, it seems like there was a Microsoft Edge update operation, followed by Windows Update operations, and then Winlogbeat was started to collect logs from the system. The PowerShell access event is not related to any of these processes directly based on the information provided."}
