This suggests that these files might be associated with localized strings for Excel Copilot features.\n\n2. **Creation Process**: All these files are being created by the same process, `SDXHelper.exe`, which is likely a component of Microsoft's Office suite.\n\n3. **Duplicate Files**: Some file names appear twice (e.g., `dc2d9a2b3ea2e7e05994c2a4cad853ad.js` and `df50bb8660801aff5168a73098dd7f99.js`), which could indicate a bug in the creation process.\n\nHere are some steps you might want to take:\n\n- **Monitor the Process**: Keep an eye on the `SDXHelper.exe` process. Is it running unexpectedly or frequently? If so, there might be something else causing these files to be recreated repeatedly.\n\n- **Check Disk Space**: Ensure that your system has enough disk space for these files. If not, consider freeing up some space or increasing your storage capacity.\n\n- **Microsoft Office Update**: Make sure your Microsoft Office suite is fully updated. There might be a bug fix related to this issue in the latest updates.\n\n- **Contact Microsoft Support**: If the issue persists and you're unable to troubleshoot it, consider reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.\n\n- **Check for Malware**: Although less likely given the process name, it's still worth running a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus software to rule out any malicious activity."}

Temporarily disable it to see if the behavior stops.\n- **Background Applications:** Check if there are any other applications running in the background that might be related to this behavior.\n- **System Files:** Make sure these files aren't causing any system instability or errors. You can check the System Information (msinfo32) tool for any related warnings or errors.\n- **Office Updates:** Ensure your Office suite is up-to-date, as the behavior might be due to a bug in an outdated version.\n\nIf the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or posting on official forums for further assistance.
