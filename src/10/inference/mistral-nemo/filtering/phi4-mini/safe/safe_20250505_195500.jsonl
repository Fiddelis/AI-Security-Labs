This suggests that a process related to Microsoft Office is actively creating and modifying files.\n\n2. **File Operations**: The process is performing two types of file operations:\n   - **File Creation**: It's creating new files in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b4e7b99c.js`.\n     The filenames are unique hashes (seemingly MD5 or SHA-1) and they all follow the pattern `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.\n   - **File Modification**: It's also modifying files with the same filename pattern but different hashes. This suggests that it might be updating or appending data to these files.\n\n3. **File Location**: All the file operations are happening within a Microsoft Office directory, specifically under `SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b4e7b99c.js`. This indicates that whatever operation is being performed, it's related to a specific Office solution package.\n\n4. **Event Timestamps**: Not provided in the given data, but if available, they could help determine how frequently these operations are occurring and whether there's any pattern or sudden change in activity.\n\n5. **Potential Threat Indication**: The fact that a process is creating and modifying files with unique hashes in an Office directory might indicate some form of malicious activity (e.g., file-based malware, data collection, etc.). However, without more context or further analysis, it's not possible to definitively identify any threat.\n\nTo investigate this further, you might want to consider the following steps:\n- Check if there are any recent changes in your system, software, or installations that could be related to these file operations.\n- Monitor the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" to see its behavior and interaction with other processes or files.\n- Analyze the contents of the created\/modified files (if possible) to understand their purpose.\n- Use security tools or consult with IT\/Security personnel if you suspect any malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of what's happening:\n\n1. **Process Name**: The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\". This suggests that all these events are related to Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Event Type**: All events have the type \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that each event signifies the creation of a new file.\n\n3. **File Path**: The files being created are all within the same directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c632729a4ff1d51af22e49e60abfdfb\\Resources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n   The filenames all follow this pattern: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\".\n\n4. **Timestamp**: The timestamps indicate that these events are happening within a short span of time (likely seconds or minutes apart).\n\n5. **Duplicate Files**: Some of the files appear to be duplicates, as evidenced by:\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_685611aa6ca3885619e5aad962528da5.js` appearing twice.\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_6cbe6a5cdc44c9a54cabe06c1615d335.js` appearing twice.\n\nThese logs suggest that the \"SDXHelper.exe\" process is repeatedly creating and recreating JavaScript files (possibly due to an error or misconfiguration in Microsoft Office), leading to duplicates. It might be worth monitoring this process to understand why it's creating these files, and potentially resolving any issues causing this behavior."}
