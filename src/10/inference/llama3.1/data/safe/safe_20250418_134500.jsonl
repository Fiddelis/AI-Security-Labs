{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file from the Winlogbeat tool, which collects and forwards Windows event logs to a central logging system. Here's an analysis of the events logged:\n\n**Initial Setup**\n\n* The first few lines show the installation and setup of various applications on the system:\n\t+ Microsoft Edge Update (multiple instances)\n\t+ RuntimeBroker.exe\n\t+ Winlogbeat\n\n**Edge Update Activity**\n\n* Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, with various events logged:\n\t+ Image loading (e.g., C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\1.3.195.49\\msedgeupdate.dll)\n\t+ Process access and termination\n\t+ Network connection detected\n\n**Winlogbeat Activity**\n\n* `winlogbeat.exe` is started, with the following events logged:\n\t+ Image loading (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\winlogbeat.exe)\n\t+ File creation (logs\/wingbeat-20250418.ndjson)\n\n**Powershell Activity**\n\n* `powershell.exe` is seen accessing a process ( likely related to the Edge Update or Winlogbeat activities)\n\n**System Events**\n\n* The following system events are logged:\n\t+ A file created in C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate ( WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.6.etl)\n\t+ Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` terminated\n\nOverall, this log suggests that the system has undergone some maintenance or updates involving Microsoft Edge and RuntimeBroker, with various related processes running in the background. The presence of Winlogbeat indicates that system event logs are being collected and forwarded to a central logging system.\n\nSome possible investigation paths based on these events:\n\n1. Verify the legitimacy of the Edge Update activity.\n2. Investigate why multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were terminated.\n3. Review the Winlogbeat configuration to ensure it's collecting relevant events and forwarding them correctly.\n4. Monitor system event logs for any potential security concerns.\n\nKeep in mind that this analysis is based on a summary of the log file content. If you're analyzing the actual log file, you may want to dig deeper into specific events or timestamp ranges for more context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"It appears you have provided a large log of Windows event data in the Elasticsearch Common Event Format (CEF). I'll provide an analysis and summary of the logs.\n\n**Event Types:**\n\nThe events can be categorized into several types:\n\n1. **File events**: These are related to file creation, modification, or deletion.\n2. **Process events**: These are related to process creation, termination, or execution.\n3. **Registry events**: These are related to registry value changes.\n4. **Network events**: These are related to DNS queries and pipe creations.\n\n**Notable Events:**\n\n1. **File downloads**: There are multiple instances of file downloads from the Microsoft Edge update server (e.g., `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`).\n2. **Unusual file paths**: Some files are created in unusual locations, such as `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\Cache`.\n3. **System process interactions**: The system processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `Explorer.EXE`) interact with various applications and services.\n\n**Insights:**\n\n1. **Potential malware activity**: The repeated file downloads from the Microsoft Edge update server might indicate a potential malware or infection.\n2. **Unusual network activity**: The DNS query events might be related to malicious activities, such as command-and-control (C2) communication.\n3. **System process interactions**: The system processes interacting with various applications and services could indicate a compromise of the system.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Review system logs**: Investigate further by reviewing the system logs for any suspicious activity or malware signatures.\n2. **Analyze network traffic**: Analyze the network traffic to identify potential C2 communication or other malicious activities.\n3. **Run anti-malware scans**: Run thorough anti-malware scans on the system to detect and remove any potential malware.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based solely on the provided log data and might not cover all possible implications or contexts. It's essential to investigate further using additional tools, techniques, and expertise to determine the actual cause of these events."}
