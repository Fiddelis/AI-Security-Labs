{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event involves svchost.exe making a DNS query. Svchost is a legitimate process often used by services, so that's not unusual on its own. Next, MpDefenderCoreService.exe detects a network connection. That makes sense because it's related to security features, likely monitoring for threats.\n\nThen there are multiple chrome.exe instances with both DNS queries and network connections. Chrome regularly does this for browsing, so nothing suspicious here. However, I notice several cmd.exe processes creating users and adding them to the Domain Admins group. This stands out because such administrative actions could indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also a PowerShell process accessing and modifying registry values. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command-line scripting and can execute malicious commands. The use of net.exe and net1.exe with user creation commands in a domain environment further raises flags, as these are often part of attack chains to create new accounts or elevate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there's an instance where conhost.exe modifies registry values, which is another red flag since it's not commonly used for legitimate purposes. The file creations by winlogbeat and powershell could be related to log management but might also be part of hiding evidence or deploying malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several signs of potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation attempts. Multiple instances of creating domain users and adding them to the Domain Admins group are concerning. The use of various legitimate tools like cmd.exe, net.exe, and PowerShell in this context suggests possible lateral movement or attack phases.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation attempts, such as the creation of new domain users and additions to the Domain Admins group using cmd.exe and net.exe. Additionally, there are signs of registry modifications and file creations which could be indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
