{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries related to `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`. The initial event with `chrome.exe` is just a DNS query, which isn't unusual on its own. But then there are multiple events tied to `powershell.exe`, starting with the creation of the process. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on.\n\nLooking closer at the `powershell.exe` events, I see a command line argument: `\"& {Get-Date}\"`. This seems like it's just running a simple script to get the current date, which doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the fact that it's appearing multiple times could be worth investigatingâ€”maybe someone is testing something or automating a task.\n\nThere are several registry access events and image load tasks. These might indicate that PowerShell is loading various DLLs, which can be part of normal operation, but sometimes attackers use dynamic loading to hide malicious activities. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks make me think there's activity in the system configuration areas, which could be concerning if it's not expected behavior.\n\nI also spot a file creation event for `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1`, followed by its deletion. This seems like a script test or policy check, but the creation and immediate deletion could be part of a larger script execution process. The fact that it's temporary might not be suspicious, but combined with other events, it's something to consider.\n\nAnother point is the file creation in the StartupProfileData folder. This suggests some configuration change on startup, which could be legitimate or part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThere are a few entries where `winlogbeat.exe` writes to a YAML file. Since this is an ELK Stack component, it's likely normal log shipping activity and probably not suspicious unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\nThe final event shows the creation of `estrutura_logico.txt`, which seems like a user document, so that might be benign.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell instances with specific command lines, registry accesses, image loads, temporary file handling, and startup profile changes. These activities could be part of a legitimate script execution or data collection process. However, given the number of events and the repeated actions, there's a moderate chance that this batch indicates some form of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nBut considering each individual action isn't overtly malicious, it's hard to say definitively without more context. The presence of `powershell.exe` with such specific behaviors might warrant further investigation but doesn't necessarily scream red flag based solely on the events provided.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system events exhibits signs that could potentially indicate suspicious activity, particularly due to multiple instances involving `powershell.exe`. These include command line arguments that appear non-malicious but could be part of a larger script or malicious payload. The repeated registry accesses and temporary file operations add some concern, suggesting possible unauthorized access or data collection. While not definitively malicious on their own, these events collectively warrant closer monitoring to ensure there's no underlying malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch is rated as moderately suspicious due to the repeated `powershell.exe` activities and related system changes. \n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{moderately suspicious}**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of three events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused in attacks. The fact that it's modifying the registry might indicate some configuration change, which could be malicious or just routine admin work.\n\nThe second event again involves powershell.exe accessing something, perhaps checking processes or other system information. This could be part of a script or an attacker exploring the system.\n\nThe third event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a known tool for log management, so this seems normal. It's setting up files to store logs, which is standard behavior.\n\nPutting them together: Two PowerShell events and one legitimate log file creation. The two powershell instances might be concerning, especially if there's no clear reason for those registry changes or process accesses. They could be signs of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. However, without more context about the user or system behavior, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards interesting because unusual PowerShell activity often warrants closer look, but the third event might not add much concern. My confidence is around 0.7 because while the first two are suspicious, they don't clearly indicate an attack on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events with PowerShell.exe modifying registry values and accessing processes, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
