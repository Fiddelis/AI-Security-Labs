{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me go through this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying the registry. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically need to make many registry changes in real-time unless something is wrong. Also, having seven such events in a row makes me think there might be an issue with Chrome or maybe some extension being malicious.\n\nThen, looking at powershell.exe activities: creating processes and accessing files. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful for scripting. The command lines show execution of scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds suspicious as that script likely captures keystrokes—so definitely a red flag for malware trying to monitor user input.\n\nThere are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with different paths pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1, each time writing logs to the TEMP directory. This repetition suggests an automated process or a persistence mechanism, which is worrying because it could mean the malware is running multiple times to stay active.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. That command usually outputs user information and in a script context, it might be used to gather system details for lateral movement or privilege escalation. The combination of whoami with other powershell executions adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET files are normal in some contexts, but when paired with the suspicious scripts, they could indicate the script is doing more than just running—it might be loading additional modules for malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes by Chrome, repeated PowerShell executions of a potentially harmful script, and use of whoami.exe. These signs point towards possible malicious activity, so I classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, creation and execution of powershell scripts with potentially malicious intent (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), and the use of whoami.exe. These events collectively indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. The goal is to analyze all these events together to determine if they indicate something malicious or at least worthy of investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's a PowerShell process with a command line that executes a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which logs keystrokes to a file in the TEMP directory. This immediately raises a red flag because such scripts are often used for keylogging, which is a common tactic in malware to capture sensitive information.\n\nThe second event shows that PowerShell loaded a DLL from Windows Defender's Platform folder. That seems suspicious because defender-related files shouldn't be directly loaded by scripts unless something is wrong. Maybe it's an attempt to hide malicious activity or inject code into trusted processes.\n\nThird and fourth events: PowerShell creates and then deletes a file in the TEMP directory. The file name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1, which looks like it's trying to bypass script execution policies. Malware often does this to avoid detection by renaming or moving files temporarily.\n\nFifth event: Another PowerShell instance creates a pipe. Pipes are used for interprocess communication, but in the context of scripts that try to hide or communicate with other processes, this could be a sign of command injection or lateral movement.\n\nThe sixth event is another PowerShell process executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 again. This repetition suggests persistence; the script might be running multiple times or across different instances to ensure it continues capturing keystrokes even if one instance is terminated.\n\nSeventh and eighth events: More DLLs being loaded from Windows Defender and urlmon.dll, which is part of URL handling in Windows. This could indicate that the script is attempting to communicate over the network or manipulate URLs for exfiltration.\n\nNinth event: PowerShell creates a file related to the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This might be an attempt to store data in non-standard locations, possibly avoiding standard logging mechanisms or trying to load on startup without being detected.\n\nTenth and eleventh events: Registry value sets by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can allow persistence across reboots or change system configurations to enable further attacks.\n\nTwelfth event: Another remote command execution with Get-Keystrokes.ps1, suggesting that this script is a key component of the malicious activity.\n\nThirteenth to sixteenth events: Various file creations by different processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe. These could be legitimate activities, but in combination with other suspicious events, they might indicate an attempt to log or move data around without proper authorization.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring theme is multiple instances of PowerShell executing a keylogging script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), which is attempting to hide itself by creating and deleting temporary files, using pipes for communication, and possibly altering system configurations through registry changes. The involvement of different processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe might be part of a broader attack vector, such as using legitimate services for persistence or network communication.\n\nThe fact that the same script is being executed multiple times across different processes suggests a possible attempt to ensure it runs continuously, which is a common tactic in persistent malware. The use of registry modifications could be an attempt to make the script run at system startup, making it harder to remove and more persistent.\n\nWhile some events might look like legitimate activities on their own (like file creation by winlogbeat.exe), the combination and frequency of suspicious activities involving PowerShell executing a known malicious script strongly indicate potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch of logs is definitely worth investigating further for signs of a cybersecurity incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the system log events reveals several red flags indicative of potentially malicious activity:\n\n1. **Keylogging Script Execution**: Multiple instances of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` running under PowerShell indicate an attempt to capture keystrokes, a common malware tactic.\n\n2. **Suspicious DLL Loadings**: PowerShell loading DLLs from Windows Defender's Platform and urlmon.dll suggests possible injection into trusted processes or network manipulation.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**: Creation and deletion of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1` in TEMP may aim to bypass script execution policies, a technique used by malware for evasion.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**: PowerShell pipe creation could facilitate interprocess communication, possibly for command injection or lateral movement within the network.\n\n5. **File and Registry Modifications**: Registry changes and file manipulations by processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe may indicate attempts at persistence or system configuration alteration.\n\n6. **Repetitive Malicious Script Execution**: The repeated execution of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across different instances suggests a strategy for persistence, ensuring the script continues functioning even after interruptions.\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the recurring and suspicious activities involving PowerShell executing a known malicious script, combined with attempts to hide and persist, this batch of logs is indeed concerning. Further investigation is recommended to assess the extent of potential compromise and implement appropriate remediation measures."}
