{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through them one by one to see if anything stands out as suspicious.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe and powershell.exe setting registry values. That's a bit concerning because those processes can be used maliciously, but they're also common for legitimate tasks. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, cmd.exe is seen running 'tasklist'. That's not unusual; users often check processes using command line tools. However, the use of tasklist.exe directly as a process might indicate something more manual or script-based activity. I should note if there are any anomalies here.\n\nLooking at the file paths loaded by tasklist.exe, they seem to be standard system files and defender components. No red flags there.\n\nI notice winlogbeat.exe creating files in its directory. That's expected since it's likely an agent running a log management tool. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new is normal during setup or updates.\n\nThen, Calculator.exe writing to the registry is odd. While some system tools do this, it's unusual for such a benign application. I should consider if this could be part of malicious activity.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing processes and creating files catches my attention. Powershell is a powerful tool often used in attacks, especially when combined with file creation. The 'registro_auxiliar.txt' file created by powershell could be related to data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple writes to registry by different processes, some legitimate and others like Calculator.exe that shouldn't typically do that. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks across various processes are a bit concerning but not necessarily malicious on their own. However, the combination with powershell.exe creating files and accessing other processes adds weight.\n\nThere's also consistent activity from chrome.exe, which is normal for browser operations, so I don't think it's an issue here.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated registry modifications across various legitimate processes could be part of a campaign trying to establish persistence or alter system configurations. Powershell's involvement in file creation and process access is particularly worrying as it's a common attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by various processes, including svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and cmd.exe, along with suspicious file creations and image loads that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process key always shows 'chrome.exe', which means these are related to the Chrome browser. The winlog key consistently mentions \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". So, every single event here involves Chrome modifying the Windows registry.\n\nI know that legitimate software often makes changes to the registry when installing updates or adjusting settings. Since all events are from Chrome and involve registry modifications, I don't immediately see any signs of malicious activity like unknown processes or suspicious file accesses.\n\nThere's no variation in the process name or task type across these events. No files are involved either, which could have indicated something more concerning. The repetition might just be normal updates or configuration changes by Chrome.\n\nConsidering all this, it doesn't look like there's anything out of the ordinary here. So, the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate registry modifications by Chrome.exe and show no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
