{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries involving `chrome.exe`. The logs show network connections and DNS queries. While Chrome is a common process, the repeated network activity could be worth monitoring, especially if it's excessive or directed to unusual domains. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nNext, there's significant activity from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command and control, so any unusual commands should raise an eyebrow. Looking at the command lines, I see scripts being executed that modify file timestamps using `Get-ChildItem` and set LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This tactic is known for evading time-based detection mechanisms. Additionally, there are multiple file creations and deletions in the Temp directory, which could indicate script execution or attempts to persistence.\n\nThe logs also show several registry accesses and modifications by `powershell.exe` and other processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `notepad.exe`. While legitimate software can modify the registry, unexpected changes here might be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nFurthermore, there are multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell, indicating it's loading various DLLs. This could be part of normal operation but also a way to execute malicious payloads.\n\nConsidering all these points together: PowerShell executing scripts that alter file times, creating and deleting files in Temp, accessing the registry, and repeated network activities by Chromeâ€”this combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The use of known attack techniques like timestamp manipulation for persistence or evasion adds to the concern.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs is definitely worth investigating further due to the red flags present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts that alter file timestamps and create\/delete temporary files, along with suspicious registry access. This indicates possible adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several powershell.exe processes with command lines that modify file last write times. The command line is using Get-ChildItem and setting the LastWriteTime to 01\/01\/1970, which looks like an attempt to change file timestamps. This could be suspicious because attackers often manipulate file times to hide their tracks.\n\nNext, there's a calc.exe process loading urlmon.dll, which is normal since it's part of Windows. But sometimes malicious processes load unusual DLLs, so I'm not sure about this one yet.\n\nThen, svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times. SvcHost is a common system process, but seeing multiple RegistryEvent tasks might indicate some activity, possibly legitimate or not.\n\nAnother event shows Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again, similar to calc.exe. Again, not inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nA powershell.exe instance loading MpClient.dll, which is from Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender uses PowerShell for scans and updates.\n\nThen more powershell.exe events modifying file times on different paths. This repetition makes me think there might be an automated script running, perhaps trying to cover its tracks by changing timestamps on multiple files.\n\nThere's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so this isn't concerning unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nOther events include ApplicationFrameHost.exe and more Calculator.exe\/RegistryEvent combos, which don't raise red flags on their own.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe processes setting registry values could be normal browser activity, but the number of such events (eight in a row) might indicate some automated or suspicious behavior, like malware attempting to modify settings.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several indicators that could point to malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell to alter file times is concerning because attackers often do this to hide their changes. Additionally, the multiple registry modifications and repetitive actions by different processes might suggest a script running in the background, possibly with malicious intent. However, some events like calc.exe loading urlmon and normal tool executions could be benign.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation because of the potential file tampering and unusual process behaviors. The PowerShell activities stand out as significant red flags.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several indicators that warrant closer examination, particularly due to the suspicious activities involving PowerShell and multiple registry modifications. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activities**:\n   - **File Timestamp Manipulation**: Several powershell.exe processes are observed modifying file last write times to 01\/01\/1970. This behavior is often indicative of malicious activity aimed at obfuscating tracks.\n   - **MpClient.dll Loading**: A legitimate action as part of Windows Defender operations, suggesting routine system checks.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple instances of svchost.exe and other processes (including chrome.exe) setting registry values. While svchost is a common process, the frequency of such events could signal suspicious behavior.\n   - Repetitive actions by different processes may suggest an automated script or malware attempting to modify system configurations.\n\n3. **Benign Processes**:\n   - calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are normal, as these are standard Windows components.\n   - winlogbeat.exe creating a file is expected if it's part of log collection activities.\n\n4. **Chrome Activity**:\n   - Eight consecutive registry modifications by chrome.exe might be unusual but could also relate to legitimate browser operations or extensions.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch contains notable red flags, particularly the PowerShell activities and multiple registry changes. These suggest potential malicious intent, making further investigation advisable."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. I'm looking at the provided JSONL data and trying to analyze it as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values multiple times. There are 13 such events where chrome.exe is modifying the Windows Registry. That seems like a lot, but I wonder if this is normal behavior for Chrome. Maybe Chrome does update certain registry keys when it runs, especially during updates or configuration changes.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in its own directory with a .yml extension. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so creating a config file here makes sense. No immediate red flags there.\n\nAnother event stands out: \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named \"unidade_logico.txt\". PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, but not all uses are malicious. However, the filename seems generic, but sometimes attackers use .txt files for lateral movement or storing commands. I'm not sure if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the other events where chrome.exe loads \"amsi.dll\" and another Defender-related DLL. These are legitimate system files that Chrome might load as part of normal operations to ensure security features are active. So, no immediate concern there.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from Chrome modifying registry keys, which could be part of its update or configuration process. There's a mix of other processes creating log or config files, which isn't unusual. I don't see any clear indicators of malicious activity here. While the repetition of Chrome's actions is notable, without additional context like timestamps or other related events, it's hard to say if that's suspicious.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think this batch doesn't indicate anything malicious and might just be normal system activities. Therefore, my classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal Chrome activity, such as registry modifications and loading legitimate system DLLs. There is no indication of malicious behavior in the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
