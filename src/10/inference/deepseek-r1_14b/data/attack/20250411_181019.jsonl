{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed and executed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The command lines aren't provided, but just seeing powershell running might be a red flag depending on the context.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe being run. That's usually harmless because it's used to get user information, but in some cases, attackers use it to check permissions or credentials.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe instances with command lines that create services. For example, \"sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\"\". Creating new services can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The script paths mentioned don't exist, which is suspicious—it might indicate an attempt to run malicious scripts.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events from various processes like cmd.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. Malware often manipulates the registry to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nI also notice that some entries show attempts to create or query services using sc.exe. This could be part of an attack chain where malicious actors try to install backdoors or other components on the system.\n\nAnother point is the use of RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems unusual. Typically, these processes wouldn't load such a DLL unless there's some injection happening, possibly by malware.\n\nThere are a few entries from svchost.exe modifying the registry as well. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malicious actors to hide their activities.\n\nOne entry stands out where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the user's Downloads folder. If this process is running legitimately, it might not be an issue, but if it's unexpected or part of a larger pattern, it could warrant investigation.\n\nLastly, there are some Pipe Created events from chrome.exe, which is more common and less concerning on its own.\n\nPutting all these together, the repeated use of powershell and cmd to create services with suspicious command lines, along with numerous registry modifications, suggests potential malicious activity. The non-existent script paths in the commands could indicate attempts to execute arbitrary code or payloads, which are red flags for an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious process creations and registry modifications, including powershell.exe accessing files and creating services with potentially malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" and the task is about setting registry values. This happens several times, which might indicate some activity within Chrome accessing the registry. Not sure if that's unusual yet.\n\nThen, there are two events where Chrome loads specific DLL files. One is amsi.dll, which I know relates to Microsoft Antimalware Scan Interface—this could be normal for system operations, but it might also be something more if it's being loaded by an unexpected process. The other file is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, so that seems legitimate.\n\nNext, there's an event with powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, even though it has legitimate uses too. An access event here might be worth looking into to ensure no malicious scripts are running.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated registry writes from Chrome, loading known system files, and a process access in PowerShell. Individually, these could be normal, but the combination—especially the multiple registry changes and the involvement of PowerShell—is a bit concerning. It might indicate some suspicious activity, like potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if it's malicious, but there are enough red flags to suggest possible investigation. So I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modification events from chrome.exe and a process access event from powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
