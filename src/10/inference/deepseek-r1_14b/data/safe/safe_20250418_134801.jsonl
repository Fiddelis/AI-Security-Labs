Then there are image loads from CompatTelRunner.exe, which I think is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected too.\n\nNext, I see setup.exe creating a pipe. Setup processes usually do this for communication, so nothing suspicious here. Services.exe and other system processes like taskhostw.exe loading DLLs or interacting with the registry are standard as well. \n\nThere's a PowerShell command executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That catches my attention because while it's common for scripts, executing commands that read .INF files could indicate malicious activity like checking for specific configurations or attempting lateral movement.\n\nThen there's more normal behavior from Chrome and winlogbeat.exe, which is likely monitoring logs as part of security measures. However, the repeated registry value sets by svchost.exe might be worth looking into since some malware uses services hosted under svchost to hide their activities.\n\nLastly, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll doesn't seem unusual on its own, but combining it with other events, it's good to note for context.\n\nPutting it all together, the PowerShell command stands out as potentially malicious.

MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, so this seems standard as it's part of system processes.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent used for log shipping, so it's expected to create files there. No red flags here.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again, which is another normal process related to Windows components.\n\nsvchost.exe creating several files under NetworkService's AppData. Svchost is a common service host, and these files are part of Delivery Optimization, so this is expected behavior.\n\nAnother svchost creating files in the same location—consistent with system updates or optimizations.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an update file. This is standard for background updates checking or downloading.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading defender components. MpCmdRun is used by Windows Defender for commands, and it's normal to load these DLLs.\n\nThen, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a file from the Temp directory. It's common for download managers to clean up after themselves, so this isn't suspicious.\n\nMore MpCmdRun activity, creating temp files and loading defender modules—nothing unusual here.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is used by command-line tools, which might be running scripts or making config changes. Mintty is often associated with Cygwin or MSYS environments, so if the user is running shell scripts, this makes sense.\n\nGit.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory. This looks like normal development activity; perhaps someone is working on a Node.js project and generating new files, especially semver-related modules which are common for versioning.\n\nLooking at all these events together, most of them are standard system processes, application updates, and development activities. There's nothing indicating malicious behavior or anomalies. Each process is performing actions that align with their expected functionalities—browsers adjusting settings, antivirus loading components, system services managing files, and development tools working on project files.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or writes to unexpected locations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all these events are generated by the same process: git.exe. That makes sense because Git uses various scripts and functions when it's running.\n\nThe task in each log is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system detected that a file was created. But looking at the paths, they're all within a node_modules directory. Specifically, under semver\/functions\/, there are multiple JavaScript files being created. The filenames include functions like compare.js, diff.js, parse.js, and so on.\n\nSo, what's semver? Semver stands for Semantic Versioning. It's a widely used standard for versioning software packages. Node modules often include semver as a dependency because it helps manage the versions of packages in a structured way. These functions (like compare, diff, etc.) are part of the semver package and are essential for its operation.\n\nNow, considering that all these events are about files being created by git.exe in a node_modules directory, this seems like normal behavior during a Git process. When you clone a repository or update dependencies, Node.js modules get installed, and their constituent files are created on the disk. This is a standard part of the package installation process.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's anything unusual here. Since all events are related to file creation by git.exe in a node_modules folder, it doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of access to sensitive files or any signs of malicious activity like multiple failed attempts or writes to unexpected locations. The paths are standard for such operations.\n\nIt's possible that the user is working on a project that uses Git and Node.js, so these logs would be expected during development or deployment activities. There's nothing here that suggests an intrusion or suspicious behavior.\n\nI should also consider whether the volume of events matters. There are 19 files listed, each being created by git.exe in the same location. While it might seem like a lot, this could just be the result of a large number of functions within the semver package being set up during an install or update process.\n\nIs there any reason to suspect that these file creations could be part of something malicious? Since they're all within the node_modules directory and are standard files for semver, it's unlikely. Malware usually targets different areas or exhibits different patterns, such as writing to system directories or creating hidden files.\n\nIn conclusion, this batch of logs doesn't indicate any suspicious activity. They represent normal file creation events during a Git operation related to Node.js modules. Therefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence because there's no evidence of anything out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal file creation events by git.exe during Node.js module setup, specifically for the semver package.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"95\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing something that happened on the system. The key elements to focus on are the process name and the file paths.\n\nFirst off, I notice that all these events are generated by \"git.exe\". That's the Git version control system. It's pretty common for developers to use Git, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within a directory structure related to a course on Software Quality (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"). Specifically, these are files inside node_modules\/semver. Semver is a Node.js package used for versioning, and having it in node_modules makes sense if someone is working with JavaScript or TypeScript projects.\n\nEach event reports that a file was created. The tasks show \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system detected the creation of these files. Now, creating files during development with Git is standard behavior—cloning repositories, updating dependencies, etc., would trigger such events.\n\nI also see a pattern where multiple files are being created under node_modules\/semver. This looks like part of installing or restoring dependencies, perhaps during a npm install command. It's normal for package managers to create or update files in node_modules when setting up a project environment.\n\nSince all these activities point to typical development operations using Git and Node.js, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious behavior here. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual file creations outside the user's scope, or known malicious process names.\n\nTherefore, considering the entire batch as part of normal software development activities, this isn't something that would require further investigation from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Git creating files in a node_modules directory during normal development activities, showing no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.\n\nLooking at the events, each line seems to be an event from system logs. The JSON structure has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields. \n\nThe process name is always \"git.exe\". Git is a version control tool, commonly used for software development. So, these could be normal activities related to coding or managing projects.\n\nEach event's task is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". That means the system is logging that a file was created. The paths all point to files inside a node_modules folder, which is typical in Node.js projects. For example, there are files like package.json, README.md, and others, which are standard in such environments.\n\nI notice that each event has a different file path under node_modules, with various modules like semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, etc. These are all common npm packages. The fact that multiple files are being created under these directories doesn't raise any red flags immediately because when you install or update dependencies in a Node.js project using npm, it's normal to see many file creation events.\n\nI also see some subdirectories like .github and .nycrc, which are related to development tools and configurations. Again, this is standard for projects using GitHub and coverage tools like NYC.\n\nSince all these activities involve the git process creating files in a typical project structure, it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no indication of unusual file names, locations outside the project directory, or other signs that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, I should consider whether an attacker could use git.exe for something malicious. While possible, the events here don't show any anomalies. No executable files are being created, and all paths seem legitimate for a development environment.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating multiple files in a standard project structure with normal npm modules. This is likely just part of someone developing or working on a Node.js project, which is expected behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events show `git.exe` creating numerous files within the `node_modules` directory, typical during development activities like installing dependencies. No signs of malicious activity detected.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation actions by git.exe during Node.js project setup or development, involving standard npm package structures and files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a batch of JSONL events and is asking whether the entire batch is relevant for investigation. They specified that only one classification (INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING) along with a justification and confidence score should be returned.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line represents an event where \"git.exe\" is creating a file in specific paths. These paths are related to Node.js modules like set-function-length, shebang-command, shebang-regex, and side-channel. The filenames include standard files for these modules—package.json, index.js, READMEs, licenses, etc.\n\nConsidering the nature of git.exe, it's commonly used for version control. When developers clone a repository or extract Node.js packages, git creates several files as part of its process. These events look like typical file creation actions during a Git operation, such as extracting a zip file from a repository or installing dependencies.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The paths are standard within a Node.js project structure. There's nothing unusual about creating these files; it's normal for a development environment. No signs of malicious activity like accessing restricted areas, multiple failed login attempts, or unexpected process spawns are present.\n\nThe fact that all events come from the same process and involve file creation in a predictable pattern makes me confident that this batch isn't suspicious. It seems like legitimate activity related to software development.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it doesn't indicate any malicious or unusual behavior. The confidence is high since these actions align with typical Git operations during development.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show the creation of files related to Node.js modules during a git operation, which is normal and expected activity for a developer environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking at the data provided.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process name in all cases is \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is being used here. The task under winlog says \"File created\" for each entry, indicating that files are being created on the system. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located under a directory structure that includes \"node_modules\". That makes sense because node_modules is where Node.js packages and their dependencies are stored. The specific module here seems to be \"sshpk\", which I recall is a Node.js library related to SSH key management. The files being created include everything from the root of the sshpk module down to its subdirectories like bin, lib, and various configuration files.\n\nNow, considering Git's role here: Git is commonly used for version control in development environments. It's normal for developers using Git to clone repositories or checkout code, which might involve creating new directories and files as part of the repository structure. The creation of multiple files under node_modules suggests that someone is installing or updating a Node.js package, possibly during a build process or setup phase.\n\nI should also think about whether this activity could be malicious. Malicious actors often try to hide their activities by using legitimate tools like Git for command and control communication or data exfiltration. However, in this case, the events are standard file creation actions related to a Node.js package. There's no evidence of unusual behavior such as executing scripts, accessing restricted areas, or creating hidden files.\n\nAnother point is that all these file creations are happening under a user directory (\"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\"), which might be a regular development environment where the user has installed some software or tools locally. The presence of .travis.yml and Jenkinsfile suggests integration with CI\/CD pipelines, which supports the idea that this is part of a legitimate software development process.\n\nI should also consider whether multiple file creation events in quick succession could indicate something suspicious. However, Git operations can generate numerous such events as it clones or checks out files, especially when dealing with large repositories or many dependencies. This seems more like expected behavior than anything malicious.\n\nAre there any red flags? The user is fiddelis, which doesn't seem like a common username but could be any user. The path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which looks like an academic course code, possibly indicating that this is part of a student's project or coursework. Students often use Git for their projects, so this aligns with normal activity.\n\nI should also check if the files being created are known to be malicious. The sshpk module doesn't ring any bells as a known malicious tool. It's widely used in Node.js applications for SSH key management, which is a legitimate purpose.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure that these events are part of standard development practices. There's no indication of unauthorized access or suspicious file names. The use of Git and Node.js modules fits within expected behavior for someone working on a software project.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the process is Git, creating files under node_modules\/sshpk with various configuration and library files. This aligns with typical developer activities during setup or deployment. No signs of malicious intent are present.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events does not indicate suspicious or malicious activity. The events correspond to normal file creation actions performed by the Git process while setting up a Node.js project, specifically the sshpk module. These activities are consistent with standard software development practices and do not suggest any security concerns.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification**: All events involve \"git.exe,\" indicating use of the Git version control system.\n2. **Event Type**: Each event logs a file creation, which is typical during Git operations like cloning or checking out repositories.\n3. **File Paths Analysis**: The files are created under \"node_modules\/sshpk,\" suggesting installation of a Node.js package.\n4. **Context Clues**: Presence of .travis.yml and Jenkinsfile indicates possible CI\/CD integration, aligning with development workflows.\n5. **Username and Location**: The user directory path suggests personal or educational use, fitting student or developer behavior.\n6. **Module Verification**: The sshpk module is a legitimate Node.js package, not known for malicious activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe log events are part of normal software development processes and do not exhibit signs of cyber threats. Therefore, they are not considered suspicious.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The events represent standard file creation during Git operations related to a Node.js project setup, indicating legitimate user activity rather than malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

I'm presented with a batch of JSONL events, each representing a file creation event in Windows. The task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the common elements across all these events. Each event mentions that \"git.exe\" is the process responsible for creating the files. The files are being created in various subdirectories under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\sshpk`. \n\nThe file paths include several .js files, man pages, and other typical Node.js module structure components. Given that all these events come from the same process and are within a node_modules directory, it suggests this is related to a software installation or an update of a Node.js package.\n\nSince `git.exe` is commonly used for version control and managing dependencies in projects, especially with Node.js, this activity seems routine during development. The files being created align with what you'd expect when installing or updating packages using npm (Node Package Manager), which often uses git under the hood for dependency management.\n\nI don't notice any red flags here, such as file creation times that are too close together or writes to unexpected locations outside of typical project directories.

The task is to determine whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation or not. I'm supposed to look at the entire batch as a whole and then return just one classification—either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING—with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLet's start by looking at each event. Each line represents an individual JSON object, so there are 16 events in total. The structure of each event is consistent:\n\n- A \"process\" field with the name set to \"git.exe\".\n- A \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created (rule: FileCreate).\n- A \"file\" field containing the path to the file that was created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\", which suggests these are files within a Node.js module directory. The specific files being created include various .js, .d.ts, .json, .md, and license files.\n\nGiven that the process is \"git.exe\", it's likely related to version control operations. Git often creates or updates files when cloning repositories, pulling updates, or installing dependencies. In this case, it seems like multiple files are being created under a node_modules directory, which is typical during an npm install operation. Node packages often have several files including their main code (index.js), type definitions (index.d.ts), package.json for dependencies, README.md for documentation, and license files.\n\nSince all these events involve the creation of standard files within a Node.js module structure, it appears to be part of a normal software development workflow. The fact that git.exe is involved might indicate that this is happening in a version-controlled project, perhaps during an initial setup or after restoring dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file creation locations outside the expected project structure, nor are there any files related to known malicious activities. The paths and filenames align with typical package structures for Node.js modules.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It seems like routine file operations during development or setup. However, I should consider if there's any context missing. For example, if the user is in an environment where such activity is unusual, it might warrant closer attention. But based solely on the information given, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\nSo, classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" makes sense because these are normal operations. The confidence in this classification is high because all events fit within standard use cases for a Node.js development environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal file creation activities during the setup or operation of a Node.js project, specifically related to creating files in the node_modules directory using git.exe.

Then there's a \"file\" field with a \"path\" pointing to various files.\n\nThe paths all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\", followed by different package names and their respective files. For example, I see entries for \"strip-json-comments\", \"supports-color\", \"tcomb-validation\", and \"tcomb\". Each of these seems to be a Node.js module, as indicated by the presence in the node_modules directory.\n\nLooking at the actions, each event is just creating a file. The process doing this is git.exe, which is typically used for version control, especially with Git repositories. When you install or update npm packages, sometimes files are created or modified, and if Git is involved, maybe it's part of a development workflow where files are being tracked.\n\nI wonder why so many files are being created in one batch. Maybe this is during the setup of a project where multiple dependencies are being installed at once. Each package.json, index.js, etc., are standard parts of Node modules. The presence of \"node_modules\" suggests that this is related to a JavaScript or Node.js environment.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity here? Well, git.exe creating files in node_modules doesn't seem suspicious on its own. It's a common operation during development. Unless the user is doing something unusual, like running Git in an unexpected context, but I don't see any red flags.\n\nThe paths are all standard, and there's no indication of executable files or scripts being created beyond what's normal for Node modules. No signs of payload execution, network connections, or other indicators of compromise.\n\nSo considering all these events together, they seem to be part of a routine process—likely the setup or update of a Node.js project with multiple dependencies.

The file paths all point to node_modules\/tcomb and various JS files like index.d.ts, index.js, lib with subfiles.\n\nHmm, node_modules is a common directory in Node.js projects for third-party packages. tcomb seems like a known library—used for type checking in JavaScript. So these events are likely from installing or updating the tcomb package using npm, which runs git to clone repositories.\n\nSince all events are normal during package installation and don't show any signs of malicious activity like access to unusual files or multiple failed attempts, this doesn't raise red flags.

There's consistency in the events—same process name and task type—which doesn't raise red flags.\n\nSo considering all this, it seems like these events are part of legitimate software operations rather than any suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe during the setup or update of a Node.js project. These activities are typical and expected when managing dependencies, showing no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
