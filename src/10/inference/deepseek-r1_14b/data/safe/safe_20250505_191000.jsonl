{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from SDXHelper.exe loading system32 files like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems a bit odd because I don't recall that being a common process. Maybe it's related to some legitimate activity, but repeated ImageLoad events could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several User Account Management tasks without a process name. These might just be system-level activities for user logins or group changes, so not sure if they're concerning on their own.\n\nThen, I see rundll32.exe being used with shell32.dll and a CLSID. Rundll32 is often used by malware to execute code, especially when it's running from unexpected locations or with unfamiliar parameters. The command line here looks like it's creating a local server, which could be part of an exploit or malicious activity.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying the registry isn't unusual since it's a common service host process, but repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate something fishy if combined with other signs.\n\nThere are two instances of winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory. That seems suspicious because beatmakers shouldn't typically create files in their own data folders, especially if the names look like temporary or new configuration files.\n\nExcel being run and loading various system DLLs is normal for an Office app. However, there's a Dns query from Excel, which could be part of legitimate functionality but might also hint at communication with external domains, possibly malicious ones.\n\nLooking at all these together: repeated ImageLoad events from SDXHelper, rundll32 with a CLSID, multiple User Account Management logs without process context, and winlogbeat creating files. These points suggest potential malicious activities like DLL injection or persistence mechanisms, which could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events that may indicate potential malicious activity, such as repeated ImageLoad events from SDXHelper.exe, a rundll32.exe process with suspicious command-line parameters, and multiple User Account Management tasks without associated processes. Additionally, there are file creation events by winlogbeat.exe in its own directory and DNS queries from Excel, which could be signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this JSONL log data to analyze. Let's see what each event is about. The first two events are from Excel.exe creating a file called real_values.csv.LNK in the Office Recent folder. That seems normal because Excel often creates shortcut files there when you open or save documents.\n\nThen there are three null events where process, winlog task, and file path are all null. These might be some kind of system checks or maybe just noise in the logs. Not too concerning on their own.\n\nThe last three events again involve Excel.exe but this time they're performing DNS queries. That's a bit odd because why would Excel need to look up domains? It could be legitimate if it's trying to access online data, but it might also indicate something malicious like communication with an external server for exfiltration or command and control.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of Excel.exe creating files in the Recent folder and making DNS queries. The file creation is normal, but the repeated DNS activity raises a red flag. It's possible that this is part of some malicious behavior, maybe a script or macro trying to reach an external resource. So overall, the batch seems interesting because it combines actions that are unusual for Excel.exe.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events where EXCEL.EXE creates files and performs DNS queries, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
