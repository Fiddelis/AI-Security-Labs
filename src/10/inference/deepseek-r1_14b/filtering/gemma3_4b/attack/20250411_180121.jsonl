Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few logs are from chrome.exe with network connection detections and a DNS query. That's pretty normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe being launched multiple times. The command lines have some red flags, like using WebClient to download files from GitHub repositories. The paths in the downloads are pointing to TEMP directories with filenames that seem generic but could be indicators of malicious activity. Also, one event shows a file being created and then immediately deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also registry access and image loading events for powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing the script to run on subsequent boots. The repeated downloading from different GitHub repositories suggests varied modules or components, possibly part of a larger campaign or malware distribution.\n\nConsidering all these together, it looks like there might be some malicious activity involving PowerShell scripts downloading files and possibly setting up persistence. The multiple downloads and deletions are concerning. So, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes were detected with command lines performing web downloads and file operations, including creating and deleting files in the TEMP directory.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches and paths. This immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell scripts are commonly used for malicious activities, especially when downloading files from external sources. These could potentially be indicators of unauthorized access or malware.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is modifying the registry. While Chrome does make changes to the system's registry during normal operation, repeated registry writes can sometimes indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms set by attackers. It's something to keep an eye on but not necessarily conclusive yet.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of file creation events involving powershell.exe and other processes like MpDefenderCoreService.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Some files are in the user's Downloads folder, which could be suspicious if they're unexpected or unrelated to known activities. For example, 'elemento_padrao.txt' and 'modulo_comum.txt' seem generic but might not be typical filenames for legitimate processes.\n\nThere are also network connection events from MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. While this service does connect to the internet for updates and real-time protection, an unusual number or timing could indicate something's off. However, in this case, it doesn't seem out of place since it's a known process.\n\nAnother point is the download of winlogbeat.yml files by winlogbeat.exe. This could be part of a legitimate log management setup, but if this tool isn't supposed to be running or if its configuration is being altered, it might indicate unauthorized access or logging activities by attackers.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are multiple indicators that point towards potential malicious activity. The PowerShell downloads from external sources, the repeated registry modifications, and the file creations in sensitive locations could all be signs of a compromise. While some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination suggests a possible attack vector or data exfiltration attempt.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities seem to combine elements that are often part of an attacker's toolkit. However, I'd want to cross-reference these logs with other sources like network traffic and file reputation checks to confirm if these files are malicious or part of legitimate operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from external repositories, registry modifications by Chrome.exe, suspicious file creations, and a network connection by MpDefenderCoreService.exe indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event involves calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since those are standard Windows processes. Next, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so these might just be legitimate activities unless they're modifying sensitive areas.\n\nThen I see Calculator.exe doing the same thing with urlmon.dll. Again, nothing suspicious on the surface. Moving down, powershell.exe appears several times with different tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers, so repeated activity here could be a red flag, but I need more context.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process looking at its own permissions. That's usually harmless unless it's part of privilege escalation. cmd.exe is used to run commands like SCHTASKS and REG DELETE, which are administrative tools. The specific commands seem aimed at deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries, which might indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, schtasks.exe is being used to delete a task named 'spawn', which could be part of a persistence mechanism. Powershell again is involved in accessing processes and modifying the registry, which adds up with the cmd.exe deletions. Reg.exe is also used to delete registry entries, specifically under HKCU\\Run, which often houses startup programs. Attackers might clean up their tracks here.\n\nConhost.exe, another standard process, is also seen modifying the registry, but without more info, it's hard to say if that's part of the attack chain. The repetition of these processes—powershell, cmd, reg, schtasks—and their actions point towards a potential cleanup or removal of malicious components, which are common steps in an attacker's kill chain after establishing persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of using legitimate tools to delete tasks and registry entries, which could be an attempt to cover tracks. While individual events might not raise alarms, the combination suggests possible malicious activity aimed at removing evidence or establishing persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing actions that could be part of a malicious script execution, including registry modifications and task deletions.

I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe with tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Process Create. These are normal operations when PowerShell starts up or interacts with system services, so nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating a temporary script file could be part of legitimate scripting activity, but it might also be used by malware to test execution policies. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nNext, that same file is deleted just after creation. This rapid create-delete cycle is a red flag because attackers often delete their traces quickly. This event stands out more than the others so far.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs and other files. These are typical when applications load libraries, so they don't raise concerns on their own.\n\nAnother event involves a file created in the StartupProfileData directory. Again, this could be normal if it's part of user profile initialization, but without more context, it's hard to say. It might not be malicious.\n\nLastly, there are events involving conhost.exe and other processes accessing or modifying registry values. Conhost.exe is often associated with command-line tools and PowerShell; these activities in isolation don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a lot of normal operations but also some concerning actions like the quick creation and deletion of a script file in the Temp directory. This could be an attempt to execute code without leaving a trace, which is common in attacks. The repeated process creations and deletions might suggest persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.\n\nGiven these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are indicators that could point to malicious activity, such as the temporary script file and rapid deletion. However, it's not definitive without more context, so my confidence isn't 100%. There are enough anomalies to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to powershell.exe, including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory.

Let's start by looking at each event and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe being accessed or created. PowerShell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. There are several 'Registry value set' tasks, which might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. The repeated creation of processes like cmd.exe and whoami.exe could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nLooking at the file interactions, powershell.exe creates a temporary script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1) in the user's AppData folder, then deletes it shortly after. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be used to avoid detection, possibly for executing malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe accesses and loads various .NET framework components and Windows Defender modules. While this isn't inherently malicious, the combination with other activities might raise concerns about lateral movement or payload execution.\n\nThe process command lines like \"& {}\" in powershell.exe seem unusual. Such commands can be used to execute code without writing scripts to disk, which is a tactic used by malware to evade detection.\n\nConsidering all these events together—multiple PowerShell invocations, registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and odd command lines—it's likely an attempt at hiding malicious activity or establishing persistence.

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where Calculator.exe and chrome.exe are involved in tasks like creating pipes or setting registry values. That seems a bit odd because these are common applications that usually don't perform such actions. But I'm not sure if it's suspicious yet.\n\nThen I notice several events from powershell.exe doing various things: creating pipes, accessing processes, modifying the registry, and loading images. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because it has powerful cmdlets that can execute commands or scripts. The fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe performing different tasks might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking closer, some powershell.exe events have command lines with specific instructions like removing files in the TEMP directory. That seems concerning because deleting files without a clear reason could be part of an attack to cover tracks or modify system configurations. Also, the repeated registry modifications might be attempting to persistence mechanisms or changing system settings for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother point is the process creations and accesses by various executables like whoami.exe. While whoami is a standard tool to get user information, its execution in combination with other powershell activities could indicate an attempt to gather information about the system, possibly leading up to more malicious actions.\n\nThe file paths mentioned, such as MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll, are legitimate Windows files, so those aren't red flags. However, the repeated loading of these DLLs by powershell.exe might be part of a script trying to hide its activities or load components for malicious operations.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell instances performing various tasks, including file deletions and registry changes, along with other processes doing similar actions, creates a pattern that suggests potential malicious behavior. The combination could indicate an attack chain where initial access is followed by lateral movement and data exfiltration or destruction.\n\nTherefore, the batch of events as a whole seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. They provided a JSONL format with multiple events.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, most are from powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and often allowed in environments. I notice several events where powershell.exe is executing Remove-Item commands to delete files in the TEMP directory. These deletions could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove malicious files.\n\nThere's also a file creation event for a script called __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1, which was created and then deleted shortly after. This might indicate that powershell is dropping a script to the temp folder, executing it, and then removing it to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. This could be an attempt to bypass antivirus by checking if the defender process is running before proceeding, or perhaps it's just legitimate activity. But in some cases, attackers might load such modules to appear benign.\n\nOther processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe are present, but they seem normal unless there's something else indicating malicious intent. However, the extensive use of powershell with deletion commands stands out more.\n\nI'm considering if these events together indicate suspicious activity. The repeated deletions in TEMP could be part of a cleanup routine after some malicious action. Also, the script creation and deletion is concerning because it suggests temporary file handling which is common in attacks to avoid persistence.\n\nHowever, sometimes legitimate scripts or processes might also create and delete files quickly. But combined with the multiple file deletions from powershell, it's more likely to be malicious. The confidence isn't too high since some of these could be normal admin tasks, but overall, it leans towards interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes deleting files from the TEMP directory and loading Windows Defender components, which may indicate attempts to remove traces of malicious activities or bypass security measures.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system log event. The goal is to determine if these logs together indicate something malicious or suspicious that needs investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's already a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and also for executing malicious scripts. But just seeing PowerShell alone doesn't necessarily mean it's bad—it depends on what it's doing.\n\nLooking closer at the command lines, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is being called with Remove-Item commands to delete specific files in the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\". The use of \"-Force\" can sometimes be a red flag because it forces deletion without prompting, which might be useful for deleting protected or hidden files that users can't normally delete. Also, the \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" part is interesting; this suppresses errors, meaning even if the file doesn't exist, it won't throw an error. That could be to avoid detection.\n\nI also see events where PowerShell creates and then deletes temporary files, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\". The fact that a script is created and immediately deleted might suggest an attempt to execute code without leaving traces on disk. This technique is often used by attackers to avoid file-based detection methods.\n\nThere are multiple entries showing image loads related to .NET frameworks and other DLLs, which could be part of normal PowerShell operation, but sometimes these can also be indicators of malicious activity if they're loading unexpected modules or if the process is doing something it shouldn't.\n\nAnother point of interest is the use of \"whoami.exe\". This tool is commonly used to determine user information, which in itself isn't suspicious. However, when combined with other activities, especially those involving file deletions and PowerShell scripting, it could be part of an attempt to gather system information for later use in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where processes like \"conhost.exe\" set registry values. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, but again, the context matters. If this is happening alongside other potentially malicious activities, it might warrant closer examination.\n\nI also notice that some events log file creations and deletions, which could be part of normal system operations or script execution. But the combination of creating temporary files, executing scripts without saving them, and deleting specific files suggests a possible attempt to execute code discreetly.\n\nPutting all this together, while individual actions might not be suspicious on their own, the pattern—multiple PowerShell commands deleting temp files, creating and immediately deleting scripts, and other process interactions—raises concerns about potential malicious activity. These could be indicators of a script attempting to clean up its traces or gather information without leaving evidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics that could indicate potentially suspicious activity, particularly the repeated use of PowerShell to delete specific files in the TEMP directory and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts. While individual actions aren't inherently malicious, their combination suggests possible attempts at discreet code execution or system information gathering, warranting closer investigation.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch is considered **interesting**, as it exhibits potentially suspicious patterns, particularly involving PowerShell's use to delete files and create\/delete temporary scripts, which may indicate an attempt to execute code discreetly. Therefore, further investigation is recommended.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interest_level\": \"high\",\n  \"suspicious_activities\": [\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"file_deletion\",\n      \"description\": \"Multiple Remove-Item commands targeting TEMP directory files.\",\n      \"potential_implication\": \"Attempt to delete protected or hidden files without user interaction.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"script_execution\",\n      \"description\": \"Creation and immediate deletion of temporary scripts (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1).\",\n      \"potential_implication\": \"Attempting to execute code without leaving traces on disk.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"process_interaction\",\n      \"description\": \"Use of whoami.exe and conhost.exe alongside other activities.\",\n      \"potential_implication\": \"Gathering system information or part of a broader malicious process.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"Further investigation is advised to assess the context and potential impact of these events.\"\n}\n```"}

So, I'm supposed to analyze all these JSONL entries together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' with registry value sets. That seems a bit off because Chrome shouldn't be making too many changes to the registry unless it's doing something normal like updating settings. But having so many in a row might be suspicious, but maybe not enough on its own.\n\nThen, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and some process creations with 'whoami.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The repeated access to it could indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or lateral movement, which would definitely be concerning. Also, 'whoami.exe' is often used to check user privileges, so having that created multiple times might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further down, there's an entry from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file and another where 'powershell.exe' creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename seems generic, but coupled with the other events, it raises flags. Attackers often create files to store data or configuration, which could be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes from Chrome, repeated PowerShell accesses, whoami executions, and suspicious file creations. These patterns look like they could be part of an attack chain—maybe initial access, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. The repetition and the types of actions make me think this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving 'powershell.exe' accessed repeatedly, which could indicate malicious activity such as script execution or lateral movement.
