{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that look suspicious. The command lines have a lot of scheduled task actions and principals. Specifically, they're trying to execute calc.exe on logon as Administrators with high privileges. That seems like a red flag because creating scheduled tasks under admin rights could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell is being used to register new scheduled tasks. Each one has a slightly different name in the command line, like \"unidade_ativo$object\" or \"registro_geral$object\". The fact that there are several similar commands suggests this might be part of a script running multiple times or trying different task names to avoid detection.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe is directly referenced without a command line. That could mean it was executed without any arguments, which isn't typical for legitimate use—usually, you see powershell being used with some commands, especially in scripts. This might indicate that the process was spawned but didn't execute anything visible, which can be a sign of something malicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, several are labeled as 'Provider Lifecycle' and others like 'Registry value set', 'Process Create', 'Image loaded'. These activities could be part of setting up persistence in the system. Registry changes and process creation under high privileges are common tactics for establishing backdoors or ensuring malware runs on each login.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and modifies registry entries. While this might seem unrelated, it could be part of lateral movement if other processes have compromised accounts with access to chrome. Alternatively, it might just be normal activity, but given the context of powershell events, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nThe image load events for various .NET components and mscoree.dll are expected when running powershell scripts, so those aren't particularly concerning on their own.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of high-privilege scheduled tasks with potentially malicious commands, combined with direct powershell executions without command lines, suggests possible malicious activity. The multiple attempts to create similar tasks might indicate an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms or ensure persistence despite some tasks being removed.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits signs indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly due to the suspicious use of PowerShell to create high-privilege scheduled tasks and direct process invocations without command lines. These actions may be part of a malware's persistence mechanism. Therefore, this batch is deemed **interesting for further investigation**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Suspicious Scheduled Task Creation:**\n   - Multiple events show powershell.exe executing commands to create scheduled tasks (e.g., `Register-ScheduledTask`). The tasks are set to run calc.exe on logon with Administrator privileges and high integrity level, which is atypical for legitimate use.\n\n2. **Variety of Task Names:**\n   - Each task has a unique name (e.g., \"tarefa_geral$object\", \"unidade_ativo$object\"). This variability might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or ensure persistence by using different names each time.\n\n3. **Direct Process Execution Without Command Line:**\n   - An event shows powershell.exe being executed without a command line, which is unusual and could suggest it was spawned as a process without running any visible script, potentially for covert activities.\n\n4. **High Privilege Levels:**\n   - The tasks are created under the Administrators group with high integrity level, allowing them to execute with elevated privileges, a common tactic in malware for persistence.\n\n5. **Other Potentially Malicious Activities:**\n   - Registry modifications and image loading events (e.g., mscoree.dll) are consistent with script execution but could also be part of malicious activities like loading libraries for further actions.\n\n6. **Chrome.exe Activity:**\n   - While less concerning on its own, the pipe creation and registry changes by chrome.exe might indicate lateral movement if other processes have compromised credentials.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of high-privilege scheduled tasks, direct process invocations, and potential persistence mechanisms strongly suggests that this batch of events warrants closer examination to identify any malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The first event shows that powershell.exe loaded an image: MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender uses those DLLs. But then in another event, it created a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Then, immediately after, there's a File Delete logged for that same script. Hmm, creating and deleting a script file quickly could be part of some malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, which is common but could also be used by malware to hide their activities.\n\nThen there's an interesting event where powershell.exe runs a command line that schedules a task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and sets it to run calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. That stands out because using scheduled tasks for execution is a common tactic in attacks, especially if they're setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further down, there are several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple such events might indicate something unusual, but it's not as suspicious as the powershell activities.\n\nBut then I notice a bunch of events where process is None and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This could mean that some remote command was executed, possibly by an attacker. These entries are concerning because they suggest unauthorized access or command execution.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is creating and deleting files quickly, which might be to drop malicious scripts temporarily. The scheduled task setup to run calc.exe at logon with admin rights is a red flag for persistence. Malware often uses scheduled tasks to maintain access after reboots. Plus, the remote command executions are suspicious.\n\nI'm also thinking about confidence level. The presence of multiple powershell events with potentially malicious commands and several remote execution attempts makes me 85% confident that this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity, including creation and deletion of a script file, registry modifications, and scheduled task setup to run calc.exe with admin privileges. Additionally, multiple remote command executions are logged.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I see an event where WmiPrvSE.exe loaded taskschd.dll. That seems a bit suspicious because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and sometimes used in attacks. But then again, it could be legitimate activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process for services, but repeated registry writes might indicate something malicious. I should note the frequency here—there are several such events.\n\nThen, another event from svchost.exe creating a file in Tasks. The path seems normal, but combined with the previous registry activity, it's worth looking into.\n\nThere's an entry where the process is None and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That's concerning because having no associated process could mean something is hiding its identity, possibly malicious code executing commands remotely.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files in specific paths—PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution. The fact that it's creating files in user-specific directories might be part of setting up persistence or storing malicious scripts.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values—conhost is usually related to console services, but any unexpected registry activity could be a red flag.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple entries loading images and making DNS queries. While Chrome can load various DLLs for functionality, the number of events and the specific paths (like MpOAV.dll) might not seem suspicious on their own, but in combination with other activities, it's worth monitoring.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files seems normal if it's part of log shipping or data collection tools. But seeing it create a .yml file could be related to configuration changes, which should be checked against known baselines.\n\nMultiple additional powershell.exe events creating files might indicate script execution, possibly for malicious purposes like dropping payloads or establishing persistence.\n\nAnother round of chrome.exe modifying registry values again—this repetition makes me think there's something deliberate happening, perhaps a script or tool running multiple commands.\n\nLastly, another winlogbeat and powershell event creating more files. The pattern here is that several processes are creating files in user directories, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows unusual process activity, especially with svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and conhost.exe performing registry modifications and file creations. The remote command execution without a known process adds to the concern. There's also a significant number of events from chrome.exe, which might be part of legitimate operation but could also be obfuscating malicious activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are multiple red flags: unusual process behavior, potential persistence mechanisms via registry and file creation, and the presence of remote command execution. However, some events like chrome.exe's activity might not be malicious on their own but contribute to an overall concerning pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll, svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files, remote command execution, PowerShell file creations, Conhost.exe registry activity, and repeated Chrome.exe events. These indicators collectively suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
