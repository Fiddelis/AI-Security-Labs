{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections. Chrome often connects to the internet, especially if you're browsing, so those alone might not be suspicious. But when I see that whoami.exe was executed with a command line pointing to \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\", that's interesting because it's a legitimate system tool but could be used maliciously to gather information about the user or system.\n\nThen there are several events from powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The command lines in these events stand out. For example, one of them has a script that tries to change the LastWriteTime of files using Get-ChildItem and setting their LastWriteTime to January 1, 1970. This seems like an attempt to make files appear older or reset timestamps, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are file creation and deletion events for temporary PowerShell scripts (__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1). Creating and then deleting scripts quickly can be a way to execute malicious code without leaving a trace, but in this case, the script was deleted immediately after creation, which is suspicious. Additionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs, which might indicate that it's running scripts or executing modules.\n\nThere's also a process access event for notepad.exe accessing the registry, and RuntimeBroker.exe doing similar actions. While these could be legitimate, they add to the noise but don't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands that modify file timestamps, along with the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, stands out as concerning. These activities are often associated with attempts to hide or alter system behavior, making the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious PowerShell activities, including file timestamp modifications and temporary script creation\/deletion, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of entries here, so I need to analyze them all together.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being used with command lines that modify file timestamps. For example, the command `Get-ChildItem` is used to get items and then set their LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This seems suspicious because changing file timestamps can be a common tactic in malware or persistence mechanisms to avoid detection. Such activity might indicate an attempt to make files appear older, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where `svchost.exe` and `Calculator.exe` are involved in registry value sets. `svchost.exe` is legitimate but often used by malware because it's a generic process name. Registry changes can be normal system operations or part of malicious activities like creating persistence points or dropping payloads.\n\nI also notice that `powershell.exe` is accessing various files and registry entries, which could be for either legitimate scripting or malicious purposes. The fact that some of these PowerShell commands are modifying file timestamps might raise flags about potential tampering with evidence or logs to cover tracks.\n\nOther events include normal processes like `calc.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and system-related executables (`winlogbeat.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`). These don't stand out as suspicious on their own but could be part of a larger pattern if combined with other activities.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry writes by different processes, especially PowerShell, might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or install backdoors. Additionally, the repeated command-line arguments in PowerShell suggest automation or script execution, which is common in attacks.\n\nTaking all these into account, there are several red flags: unusual file timestamp modifications, potentially suspicious registry activity from multiple processes, and the use of `svchost.exe` which can be a sign of malware. However, without more context about the environment and baseline behavior, it's hard to say definitively if this is an attack.\n\nI would rate the confidence as moderate because while there are concerning signs, they could also be part of legitimate system administration or other benign activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell modifying file timestamps and interacting with registry entries.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is either 'Registry value set' or 'Image loaded'. The first few entries show 'RegistryEvent' tasks and no file involved, then one shows an image load for amsi.dll, which I know is related to Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface. Another event loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Those seem normal because Chrome might interact with system components.\n\nThen there's an entry where the process is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping, so that's expected and not suspicious.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, but just creating a file isn't necessarily malicious. It could be legitimate admin work or part of script execution.\n\nLooking at the rest, there are several more chrome.exe events with registry writes and image loads. Since these are standard operations for a browser, they don't raise red flags on their own unless there's an unusual frequency or other indicators.\n\nConsidering all together, none of these actions seem out of place. The high number of chrome.exe activities might be notable, but if the user is actively using Chrome with multiple tabs or extensions, that's normal. There's no evidence here of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal process activities such as registry modifications and file loading by Chrome.exe, along with expected log shipping operations and PowerShell usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
