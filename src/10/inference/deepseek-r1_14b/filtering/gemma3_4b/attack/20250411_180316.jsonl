Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal since many Windows processes interact with the registry. Next, there's PowerShell accessing something. I know PowerShell can be used maliciously, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen, calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That path looks suspicious because I've heard that sometimes malware drops files in the System32 folder and uses legitimate processes like Calculator to execute them. But wait, isn't urlmon.dll a standard Windows file? Maybe not malicious, but worth noting.\n\nSVCHOST is running multiple times. It's a common process for services, so that alone doesn't raise flags unless it's doing something unusual. The event shows registry writes; again, normal if the service requires it.\n\nThere's an instance of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. That seems like log file creation, which is expected from such monitoring tools. Probably not suspicious.\n\nWhoami.exe being run without any arguments—sounds benign since it's just checking user information. But again, sometimes attackers use legitimate commands for persistence or info gathering.\n\nPowerShell and cmd.exe are appearing multiple times with various actions. The command line in one of the cmd events stands out: it's trying to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That might indicate someone is trying to remove traces or stop a process. Why would they do that? Maybe they're cleaning up after an attack.\n\nLooking at WMIC.exe, which was used with a similar command as cmd.exe—deleting notepad.exe processes. This could be part of a script meant to hide activity. Using multiple methods (WMIC and cmd) adds suspicion because attackers often use varied tools to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several instances where these processes load urlmon.dll or other system files. Could this indicate that malicious code is being injected into legitimate processes? Or maybe it's just normal operation. I'm not entirely sure, but the repeated loading of these files across different processes might be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations, registry writes, and attempts to delete other processes using different methods. This pattern could indicate an attacker trying to execute commands, possibly cleaning up or installing something malicious. The use of legitimate tools like PowerShell and cmd in such a way suggests potential malicious activity rather than normal user behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the combination of events shows possible command-line abuse and process manipulation, which are common signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for potential malicious commands, and attempts to delete processes like notepad.exe using wmic.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances of processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, conhost.exe, schtasks.exe, and svchost.exe. Each has different command lines or tasks associated with them. \n\nLooking at the winlog field, there are various tasks such as Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, Image loaded, and others. For example, powershell.exe is being used multiple times with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks. This makes me think about potential script execution or persistence mechanisms since PowerShell is often a tool attackers use.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe command that copies an exe file and renames it using copy \/Y. That's a bit concerning because replacing system files can be dangerous, possibly indicating tampering with system binaries to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. Deleting tasks could be part of removing traces or disabling protective measures. Then there's the process 'schtasks.exe' being created and loading taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows component but might be used maliciously if combined with other actions.\n\nThe use of whoami.exe in multiple events suggests information gathering to determine the user context, which could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. The command lines for whoami.exe don't show any arguments, though, so maybe it's just being used to check permissions or environment.\n\nsvchost.exe is often involved in legitimate Windows operations, but here it's modifying the registry, which could be a sign of installing a service or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes. This is significant because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The combination of registry writes from various executables raises suspicion about potential malicious activity.\n\nThe repeated 'Process Create' events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe might indicate the use of command-line tools to execute scripts or commands, which are common in attack chains. This could be part of a broader campaign to maintain access, gather information, or deploy additional payloads.\n\nI'm also noticing that some command lines are incomplete or have odd arguments, like 'cmd.exe \/c ' without any following command. This might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual intent or perhaps an indicator of a failed execution.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of process creation and manipulation across different system areas (registry, file system). The repeated use of tools known for their malicious potential and the specific tasks performed could indicate可疑 activity. However, some events might also be part of normal user behavior or legitimate script executions, so I need to assess if this combination crosses into something that requires investigation.\n\nGiven the number of potentially suspicious activities like registry modifications, process creations with command-line arguments, file copies, and deletions of scheduled tasks, it's likely that these events warrant further investigation. The confidence level is high but not certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process creations with potentially malicious command lines, and file operations that could indicate persistence or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see... There are 24 events here, each in JSONL format with process, winlog, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first event: chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll. That seems normal because Chrome might interact with system components. Then another Chrome event loading MpOAV.dll, which I think is related to Windows Defender. So these two might just be regular activities.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's a bit more concerning because command-line tools are often used in attacks. But let me not jump the gun yet—maybe it's part of legitimate scripts or system maintenance.\n\nThen conhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is usually for console windows, but seeing it modify the registry could be suspicious. I should note that.\n\nAnother Chrome event accessing the registry again—could be trying to persist some settings? Or maybe related to extensions?\n\nPowershell.exe accesses another process and then creates a new process with an empty command line. That's tricky because PowerShell is often used maliciously, especially when commands are obfuscated or empty. Empty command lines can indicate that the script isn't executing directly through the command line, perhaps using other methods.\n\nWhoami.exe runs without any arguments—it's usually harmless but might be used to check user permissions. It doesn't seem too suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. This repetitive behavior could indicate some automation or script execution. It's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for lateral movement or executing payloads.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe is used with \/c—but the command line is empty here too, which is odd. Maybe it's part of a larger chain but without seeing the actual command, it's hard to tell.\n\nTowards the end, I see several ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some .NET frameworks and Windows Defender components. Legitimate scripts might do this, but attackers sometimes load malicious libraries or bypass AMSI using these techniques.\n\nThe last event is a file creation in the Temp directory named with a random-looking filename ending with .ps1. That's concerning because creating script files can be part of dropping malware. Especially if it's created by PowerShell itself, which could be for executing scripts without saving them to disk, but sometimes attackers create temporary malicious scripts.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of cmd and powershell accessing the registry, creating processes with empty command lines, loading various DLLs, and creating a temp script file. These behaviors, especially when occurring in combination, can indicate potential malicious activity like persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network. However, some events could also be from legitimate system operations or user activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of using PowerShell with empty command lines, multiple registry modifications, and file creation in Temp suggests possible malicious behavior. While individual events might not be alarming, together they paint a picture that needs closer scrutiny.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided event logs indicates a potential security concern due to several red flags:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Modifications**: The use of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` setting registry values could indicate attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**: The repeated use of `powershell.exe` with empty command lines suggests possible obfuscation or execution of malicious scripts, a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\n3. **File Creation in Temp Directory**: A temporary .ps1 file created by PowerShell could be part of dropping malware or executing malicious scripts, which is concerning.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**: While some DLLs are legitimate, the variety loaded by PowerShell might be attempting to bypass security mechanisms like AMSI.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of events is classified as INTERESTING and warrants further investigation to determine if a security incident has occurred or is ongoing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"INTERESTING\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of events in JSONL format, each representing some activity on the system. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they indicate something malicious or at least worth investigating.\n\nLooking through the first event: it's a PowerShell process deleting a file. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. I know that PowerShell scripts can be malicious, especially if they're being deleted after execution to cover tracks.\n\nThen there are several events where the command line for powershell.exe is \"& {}\", which seems unusual. Typically, you'd see something like \"-command\" followed by an actual script or command. The task in these cases is related to Provider Lifecycle, which I think is part of PowerShell's initialization process. It might be a sign that the script is trying to run without being detected or just part of legitimate scripting.\n\nThere are multiple such events with similar command lines and tasks, so maybe it's part of some automated process or script execution. But the repetition makes me wonder if this is part of an attempt to bypass detection by running multiple small scripts or using different command-line arguments.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That's probably normal since winlogbeat is responsible for collecting logs, so it might be setting up its configuration files.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is loading a DLL (MpClient.dll) which is part of Windows Defender. That seems okay; PowerShell sometimes loads various modules or libraries.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which I think is related to PowerShell profiles. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own but could be part of legitimate scripting or configuration.\n\nLooking at registry events and process access tasks, these are common operations for scripts trying to modify configurations or interact with other processes. However, multiple such events might indicate a script running with elevated privileges or attempting to change system settings.\n\nThe whoami.exe event is interesting too. It's usually used to check user permissions or credentials. If this is part of a script, it could be verifying the current user context, which could be malicious if trying to elevate privileges or access restricted resources.\n\nThen there are multiple events with complex command lines in powershell.exe, each checking for the existence of specific .bat files and exiting based on that. The paths seem arbitrary but might indicate some form of persistence mechanism or attempting to execute other scripts only under certain conditions. This behavior is a bit unusual and could be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection by checking if certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows repeated use of PowerShell with potentially suspicious command-line arguments, deletion of script files, checks for specific .bat files which might not exist, and interaction with system processes and registry. While some activities are normal, the combination suggests possible malicious scripting behavior aimed at evading detection or performing unauthorized actions.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the batch of logs exhibits behaviors consistent with potential malicious activity, particularly through unusual PowerShell usage and script deletions. These actions could be part of an attempt to hide traces or gain unauthorized access. Therefore, the batch is deemed interesting for further investigation.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system logs is considered interesting due to suspicious activities involving PowerShell scripts, repeated command-line anomalies, file deletions, and checks for non-existent files, which may indicate malicious intent. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual activity with it should be flagged. The command lines in the first event check if certain files exist and exit accordingly. This could be part of a script checking its components, but it's worth monitoring.\n\nThen, there are several events where PowerShell loads various DLLs. While this is normal for scripts running in PowerShell, the specific DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll might indicate .NET framework usage, which can be legitimate or malicious depending on context.\n\nI notice a file creation event for '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1', followed immediately by its deletion. This temporary script creation is suspicious—it might suggest an attempt to bypass PowerShell's script policy by creating and then deleting the file if it detects monitoring, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry writes from 'chrome.exe'. While Chrome can modify the registry for settings, frequent writes without clear purpose could indicate tampering, especially if they're part of a larger pattern with other processes.\n\nLastly, there's a pipe creation event from PowerShell. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but in some cases, they might be a method to hide malicious commands or exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated Registry modifications by Chrome, temporary script file handling by PowerShell, and unusual process activity like file deletions could indicate potential malicious behavior. However, without more context on the system's normal baseline, it's hard to definitively say these are attacks. But given the red flags, especially the script testing and deletion, I'm leaning towards this being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, along with potential attempts to bypass script policy checks, indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze for potential malicious behavior. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they're all related to PowerShell processes. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. So it's a tool that's commonly targeted by attackers.\n\nThe first few events show tasks like \"Registry value set\" and \"Process Create.\" I know that changing registry values isn't inherently bad, but if done in certain ways or with other indicators, it could be suspicious. Also, creating a new process from PowerShell might be normal for script execution, but it's something to watch.\n\nThen there are events where specific files are accessed, like mscoree.dll and others. These are legitimate system files, so that might not raise a red flag on its own. But combined with other actions, it could indicate a malicious payload being loaded.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of these processes, I see they're creating new items in various directories using New-Item and then setting content via Set-Content. The paths mentioned seem to be creating batch files, which are executed as scripts. The value set is \"dir,\" which just lists directory contents—seems benign, but maybe it's part of a larger script.\n\nI also notice that multiple events have similar command lines, each targeting different directories and filenames. This repetition might indicate automation or script execution, possibly from a loop in the code. If these are all legitimate scripts, that's normal. But if they're being executed without proper authorization or during unusual times, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of temporary files. There's an event where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 is created in the Temp directory. Temporary PowerShell scripts can be part of testing or configuration, but they can also be used by attackers to execute malicious code temporarily.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple PowerShell processes creating files, modifying registry entries, and accessing system files. While individually each action might not indicate malicious activity, the combination could raise concerns. The repeated creation of batch files with 'dir' content might suggest a script that's enumerating directories or perhaps setting up persistence mechanisms. Registry modifications could be part of installing malware.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or user activity around these events, it's hard to definitively say it's malicious. But the pattern is concerning enough to warrant closer inspection. So, I think this batch should be considered potentially suspicious and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits characteristics that are potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Tool Usage**: All events involve PowerShell processes. This tool is commonly exploited by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Events show registry value modifications. While not inherently malicious, such changes can be part of malicious activities and should be monitored.\n\n3. **File Access and Creation**: The accessing of system files like mscoree.dll could indicate script execution or payload loading. Creating temporary PowerShell scripts in the Temp directory might suggest testing or unauthorized code execution.\n\n4. **Script Execution**: Multiple events involve creating batch files using New-Item and Set-Content commands. The repetition of such actions could signal automated or malicious scripting, especially if executed without proper authorization.\n\n5. **Pattern Analysis**: The consistent creation of files across various directories with similar naming conventions may indicate a script running in loops, potentially for directory traversal or persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual actions might not be suspicious, the combination and pattern suggest potential malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to assess the context and determine if these events pose a security risk."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a JSONL file. All the events seem to be related to PowerShell executions on a Windows system. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe is deleting a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1. That caught my attention because scripts in the Temp directory might be temporary files, but deleting them could indicate something malicious.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe. Not sure if that's suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it might be part of some communication or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe third event has a complex command line: it's creating two batch files in different paths and then exiting based on whether they exist. This seems odd because why create new files from PowerShell? Maybe setting up scripts to run at startup or something.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, which is normal when running scripts, but the specific ones could be checked against known malicious ones. However, I don't recognize any immediate red flags here.\n\nThere's also a File Created event for another batch file in C:\\componente_geral\\... That path doesn't look standard. Creating files in non-standard locations might be an attempt to hide or persistence.\n\nThen there are several Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry is a common tactic for persistence, like adding run keys or startup entries. This makes me more suspicious because multiple writes could indicate setting up autoruns or altering system configurations.\n\nThe later events show command lines with complex paths involving Test-Path checks on various .bat files. This seems like an attempt to check if certain files exist before proceeding. If these files are being checked across different locations, maybe the script is trying to ensure persistence across multiple directories or trying to avoid deletion.\n\nPutting it all together: a lot of activity from PowerShell creating, deleting, and checking files in unusual paths, along with registry modifications. These behaviors could be indicative of malicious scripts attempting to install backdoors, create persistence mechanisms, or spread across the system. The use of temporary files and multiple file operations might also suggest an attempt to cover tracks or ensure the script runs even after reboots.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being suspicious because it's a series of actions that are more than just normal script execution. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain if these are legitimate admin scripts or actual malware. But given the combination of file operations and registry changes, I'd say there's a high probability of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis indicates potential suspicious activity involving PowerShell executions on a Windows system. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **File Operations**: Multiple events show powershell.exe deleting and creating files in non-standard paths (e.g., C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, C:\\modulo_secundario). This could indicate attempts to hide or establish persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: There are several registry writes from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe, which may be used for persistence mechanisms like startup entries or system configuration changes.\n\n3. **Command-Line Activities**: Complex command lines suggest scripts checking for file existence across various paths, possibly attempting to ensure persistence or avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: The observed behavior—file creation\/deletion in unusual locations, registry modifications, and complex script execution patterns—raises concerns about malicious activity such as establishing backdoors, persistence, or spreading. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the nature of these activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of events, each in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch as a whole and decide if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event shows that powershell.exe is being executed with a command line argument that checks if a specific .bat file exists. If it does, it exits with 0; otherwise, 1. This seems like a check for the presence of another script or component.\n\n2. The next few events also involve powershell.exe, including tasks like loading images (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll), creating files in temporary directories, deleting those files, and accessing the registry. These are common behaviors for PowerShell scripts, especially when dealing with configuration or testing environments.\n\n3. There's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file related to its configuration. That seems normal if this is part of log management software running on the system.\n\n4. I notice several instances where powershell.exe is checking different paths using Test-Path in each command line. Each time, it's looking for .bat files or executables in various directories. This repeated checking could be a sign of either legitimate script execution or potential malicious activity trying to check if certain tools are present.\n\n5. There are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and processes. These actions aren't inherently suspicious but can be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\n6. Towards the end, there's an event from whoami.exe being executed. This is a standard system command used to get user information, so it doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows extensive use of PowerShell with multiple checks for specific files and some registry modifications. While each individual action might not be malicious, the combination could indicate an attacker checking for certain tools or attempting persistence. The repeated attempts to check various paths might suggest a broader script trying different possible locations, which is more concerning.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the repetitive and varied file checks could be indicative of malicious behavior, even if each action alone isn't suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:** Each event involves powershell.exe executing commands that check for specific files using `Test-Path`. This suggests an external script is verifying the existence of certain files or executables on the system.\n\n2. **File and Registry Access:** The creation, deletion, and registry access by powershell.exe are flagged as potential indicators of malicious activity, such as establishing persistence or gathering information.\n\n3. **Repetitive Checks:** The multiple checks across various directories may indicate a script attempting to locate tools or configurations, which is often a precursor to more malicious actions.\n\n4. **Contextual Assessment:** While individual actions aren't suspicious, the pattern and volume suggest a possible attack vector or system probing.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"intrusion\": {\n    \"status\": \"interesting\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe events checking various file paths, creating temporary files, accessing registry values, and using whoami.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst off, the logs are all related to processes being created and accessed, with a lot involving PowerShell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines in some of these events have conditional checks using Test-Path looking for specific files. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\\\\\"C:\\\\registro_ativo\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_comum.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This seems like a script is checking if certain files exist and exiting based on that. It could be part of legitimate system checks, but it might also indicate some form of file verification during malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts in different locations under the user's AppData directory. For instance, \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\" is created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior might be trying to bypass certain script execution policies or test if the system allows running such scripts. It's a bit unusual for legitimate scripts to create and delete themselves so quickly, especially with random filenames like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\".\n\nThere are also multiple events where different images are loaded by PowerShell.exe, including various DLLs from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While this is normal for script execution, the combination of these along with the file checks might raise suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there's an instance where whoami.exe is executed, which could be used to gather user information. This command, when paired with other activities like file checking, might be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack chain.\n\nFurthermore, a cmd.exe process is created with a command that exits based on the existence of \"%%temp%%\\\\objeto_logico.txt\". The use of environment variables (%%temp%%) here suggests it's trying to reference the system's temporary directory. This could be another way to check for specific files or create them temporarily, which might be part of malicious payload execution.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes with conditional file checks, creation and deletion of scripts in temp directories, loading various DLLs, use of whoami.exe, and cmd.exe commands that interact with the filesystem. These activities could indicate a script or tool attempting to validate its environment, potentially as part of initial access, persistence, or lateral movement stages in an attack.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread across different processes and involve multiple checks makes it less likely to be a false positive from a legitimate script. Usually, legitimate scripts don't delete themselves so quickly and wouldn't combine such varied actions across cmd.exe and PowerShell.\n\nSo putting this all together, while some of the activities on their own might not be suspicious, the combination raises red flags. It could indicate malicious behavior or at least exploratory activity by an attacker trying to establish persistence or move laterally within a network.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several indicators that merit attention from a cybersecurity standpoint:\n\n1. **Abuse of PowerShell**: The extensive use of PowerShell.exe is notable, as it's commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The conditional checks in the command lines suggest potential file verification processes.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion**: The creation and subsequent deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts in user directories might indicate an attempt to bypass execution policies or test script permissions, which is unusual for benign activities.\n\n3. **Use of whoami.exe**: This command could be part of reconnaissance efforts to gather user information, potentially as a precursor to more malicious actions.\n\n4. **cmd.exe Command Execution**: The cmd.exe process with conditional file checks using environment variables suggests interaction with system directories, possibly indicating payload execution or lateral movement.\n\n5. **Registry and File Activity**: Multiple registry writes and file accesses by PowerShell.exe could be part of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual actions might not be suspicious, the combination of these events—especially across different processes like cmd.exe and PowerShell—points to potential malicious behavior, such as initial access, persistence establishment, or lateral movement within a network. This warrants further investigation to assess the risk and determine appropriate mitigation strategies."}

Then there's a cmd.exe accessing the registry, which is normal for some scripts or legitimate processes. But then whoami.exe runs, which is a common utility to check user information; that's usually not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple powershell.exe instances being created and accessing various files.

The paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\entrada_temporario...\" don't immediately ring any bells as malicious.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe is loading different .dll files, which is normal because PowerShell often uses these for functionality. However, I notice that some command lines are quite long and have complex paths with backslashes; sometimes attackers use such structures to hide malicious activities or persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut wait, all the events seem to be about process creations and file\/registry accesses without any indication of actual exploitation or exfiltration. The repeated checks using Test-Path might be part of a script verifying if certain files exist before proceeding, which could be benign but could also indicate some form of reconnaissance or setup for further actions.\n\nI'm wondering if these are all from the same user session or spread out. If they're spread across time, it might suggest an ongoing process. However, without timestamps, it's hard to assess persistence. Also, the command lines seem repetitive with slight variations in paths, which could be part of a legitimate script checking multiple locations.\n\nOn one hand, the volume of powershell.exe activities might raise flags since attackers often use PowerShell for malicious tasks. On the other hand, if this is from a system running scripts or automated processes, it might not be suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the numerous powershell.exe instances and the nature of their command lines, even though individually they don't indicate malicious activity. The combination could hint at something more concerning, like script-based attacks or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with complex command lines checking for file existence may indicate potential malicious activities or script-based attacks.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 70\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing some system activity. My task is to analyze the entire batch and decide whether it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first few events show powershell.exe loading images (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll). These are related to Windows Defender, which is legitimate software, so that seems normal.\n2. There's a file being created in the Temp folder with a PowerShell script name (__PSScriptPolicyTest...). That caught my attention because scripts in temp directories can be suspicious if they're executing malicious code. But then I see it gets deleted right after, which might indicate some automated process.\n3. The events also show powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Since PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate tasks and attacks, these actions could be red flags. However, they can also be part of normal administration activities.\n4. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe runs specific command lines testing the existence of various paths. These seem repetitive and might be part of some automated check or deployment script, but they could also be a way to test if certain files exist as part of malicious activity.\n5. Towards the end, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. This is commonly used to determine user permissions and can be part of legitimate scripts or attacks to gather information.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several signs that could indicate suspicious behavior: repeated file creation\/deletion in temp folders, multiple registry accesses, process access, and repetitive command-line checks for files which might suggest a script testing multiple locations. However, some activities like checking for file existence and using Windows Defender-related DLLs are legitimate.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the combination of events that could potentially indicate malicious behavior, such as using powershell.exe in suspicious ways, even though individually they might not all be bad. The confidence isn't very high because there's no clear evidence of an attack, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and file operations that could indicate potential malicious activity. The repetitive command-line checks for files named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths are concerning, as this is a known script often used in attacks to capture keystrokes. Additionally, the creation of temporary PowerShell scripts followed by their deletion might be part of an attempt to hide malicious activities. While some actions could be legitimate, others suggest possible exploitation or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. There are quite a few entries here, so I'll need to analyze them carefully.\n\nStarting with the first event, it shows that powershell.exe accessed some processes and loaded various .dll files like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. This is pretty standard because PowerShell often loads these libraries when running scripts or commands.\n\nNext, there's a file creation event for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 in the Temp directory. Immediately after that, the same script is deleted. This temporary script might be part of a testing phase or a legitimate process to check if certain policies are enforced.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there are two instances where it's checking if specific .ps1 files exist using Test-Path and exiting based on their presence. These checks could be part of an automated setup script ensuring that necessary components are in place, which isn't inherently suspicious but worth noting.\n\nThere's also a process running winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's expected behavior for log shipping tools like the Elastic WinLogBeat, so no cause for concern there.\n\nOther events include powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. These are common actions for PowerShell scripts managing configurations or performing administrative tasks.\n\nI spot that whoami.exe was run, which is a standard tool for determining user information and typically not malicious unless used inappropriately. Additionally, calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll, but since this is a legitimate Windows DLL related to URL handling, it's normal.\n\nThe events involving svchost.exe modifying the registry are also typical as many services use svchost.exe, which runs under different service identifiers.\n\nConsidering all these events together, while each individually might raise an eyebrow, they don't collectively indicate malicious behavior. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script could be part of legitimate testing or policy enforcement checks. The repeated ImageLoad and ProcessAccess events are standard for scripts running in PowerShell, especially those invoking external libraries and services.\n\nThere's no evidence of unusual file operations beyond the temporary script, no signs of network communication, or any indicators like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts that would warrant an investigation.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the entire batch, I don't see enough information to classify this as interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell activity including script checks and temporary file creation\/deletion. Other processes like whoami.exe and calc.exe are performing standard operations, with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"ANALYSIS\": {\n    \"1-3\": \"PowerShell loading .NET libraries is normal.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze this batch of system log events as a cybersecurity expert. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial events show 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which is likely related to log management and probably not suspicious on its own. Then there are multiple entries from 'powershell.exe', including process accesses and registry value sets. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to see what commands were executed.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one event has '& {ls -recurse\\ngci -recurse}', which translates to listing files and directories recursively in a directory. That's not inherently bad but could be part of data gathering by an attacker. The process also accessed registry keys, which can indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nThere are several 'Process Create' events for both 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. 'Whoami.exe' is usually used to check user information, so seeing it multiple times could be normal in certain environments but might warrant closer look if not expected.\n\nThe majority of the events after that are network connection detections from 'chrome.exe'. Chrome's legitimate activity often involves many connections, especially for web browsing. However, the frequency here is high; 13 instances of NetworkConnect and a couple of DnsQuery tasks. While this could be normal user behavior, an unusually high number might suggest something else.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple image load events from 'powershell.exe', loading various DLLs. This can be part of legitimate scripting but also sometimes used in malicious scripts to load components dynamically.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of multiple PowerShell commands accessing registry and creating processes, combined with a high number of network connections from Chrome, might indicate either automated script execution or potential malicious activity. However, without clear signs like suspicious file creations or known indicators of compromise (IoCs), the confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell process creations and activities, including registry modifications and script execution, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of events related to PowerShell executions. First, there's the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file. That might be suspicious because attackers often use such scripts for malicious purposes.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with similar command lines that involve directory listings. The repeated command-line arguments like \"ls -recurse\" could indicate automated or script-driven activity, which raises flags as it's common in attacks to iterate over files and directories.\n\nAlso, I notice a process named conhost.exe accessing the registry, which is unusual because conhost isn't typically involved in such operations. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe interacts with other processes or system components like MpClient.dll, which could be an attempt to load malicious code into legitimate processes—a technique attackers use to hide their activities.\n\nLastly, there's a file named estrutura_secundario.txt being created. The name seems generic, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. However, combined with the other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nOverall, the repeated PowerShell activity and associated file operations, along with registry changes and process interactions, suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions with suspicious command lines, file creations\/deletions in temporary locations, and registry modifications.
