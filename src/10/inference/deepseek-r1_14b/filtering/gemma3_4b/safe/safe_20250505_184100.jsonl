Let's go through the events one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to DiscordSetup.exe and Update.exe. The first event shows DiscordSetup.exe being created, then an image load for it. Then, there's a file creation under SquirrelTemp, which is where Discord stores its temporary files during updates. So far, this looks like normal Discord update activity.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for Update.exe and related DLLs. These seem to be part of the standard process when an application starts up—it loads necessary libraries. No red flags here.\n\nThere's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That's probably from the log collection tool itself, generating logs or configuration files. Again, normal behavior.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. These typically occur when another process accesses an existing one, which is common in Windows for things like debugging or monitoring tools. Since we're seeing this for Update.exe repeatedly, it might be part of Discord's update mechanism being monitored by the system or other processes.\n\nThe last few events are about starting Discord.exe with a specific command line argument related to squirrel-install. This suggests that the installation or update process is completing and launching the main application. This is consistent with normal software updates where after downloading, the setup runs the application.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to follow the typical pattern of a user installing or updating Discord. There's nothing out of the ordinary like failed processes, access denials, or unusual file creations that might indicate malware activity. The repeated ProcessAccess events on Update.exe could be concerning if we didn't know about Discord's behavior, but in this context, it makes sense.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious processes, unexpected file accesses, or deviations from standard update procedures. Therefore, while the events are legitimate, they aren't indicative of any suspicious activity that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal Discord setup and update activities, including process creations, image loads, file operations, and access events.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events from a Windows machine. All the events are related to Discord processes and some updates. Let me try to break them down.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of \"Discord.exe\" activity here. The events include ImageLoad, ProcessCreate, Pipe Created, and ProcessAccess tasks. These seem pretty standard for when Discord starts up or runs various components. For example, loading ffmpeg.dll is normal since Discord likely uses it for media processing.\n\nThen I notice an Update.exe process creating a shortcut. That makes sense if the system is checking for updates or installing them. The command line shows creating a Discord shortcut and using app.ico as the icon, which again seems typical for software updates.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All activities are within Discord's expected operations—launching processes, accessing other processes, loading necessary files. There's nothing like failed logins, access to restricted areas, or communication with external servers outside known domains.\n\nSince everything appears consistent with normal Discord operations and system updates, I don't see any red flags indicating malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard Discord.exe processes including file loading, pipe creation, process access, and update-related activities.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze as part of detecting potential malicious behavior. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's Discord.exe being launched with a specific command line that includes various flags like --type=utility and some paths. The task is Process Create, which makes sense when starting an application. Nothing immediately suspicious here, but I should keep an eye out for any unusual arguments or behaviors in subsequent events.\n\nNext, there are several events related to Discord.exe accessing processes and loading images. For example, Image loaded events for ffmpeg.dll and d3dcompiler_47.dll, which are legitimate parts of Discord's functionality since they handle media processing and graphics. These are standard operations when running Discord, so no red flags yet.\n\nThen I notice multiple File created tasks by Update.exe under different paths. This includes creating a shortcut on the desktop. Shortcuts being created could be normal if it's part of an update process, but I need to check if this is expected behavior. If this is during an update or installation, it might not be malicious.\n\nI also see several Process accessed events for both Discord.exe and Update.exe, but without any file paths involved. These seem routine as the processes are interacting with each other or accessing system resources.\n\nOne thing that catches my attention is the frequency of Process accessed events for Update.exe. There are 16 such events in a row, which might indicate something unusual. However, considering it's related to creating files and shortcuts, maybe it's part of an update process that's writing multiple entries to the log.\n\nI don't see any signs of processes being executed with elevated privileges or accessing restricted areas. The files created are typical for application updates or installations, like shortcuts and configuration files in standard Windows directories.\n\nSince all the events relate to Discord.exe starting up normally and Update.exe creating necessary files, there's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious activity. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the normal startup and operation of Discord.exe, including process creation, image loading, and file creation for shortcuts.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking through the JSONL events, I notice a lot of entries from Discord.exe and Update.exe. The tasks include things like Image loaded, Process accessed, File created, and Registry value set. \n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where Discord.exe loads different DLL files like libEGL.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and vk_swiftshader.dll. These might be legitimate for a graphics-related application like Discord, so that's not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen, Update.exe is involved in creating shortcut files, both on the Start Menu and Desktop. It also accesses processes multiple times, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's normal or not. However, seeing the same process accessed repeatedly might raise an eyebrow, especially since there are a lot of these events.\n\nThe really interesting part comes when I see the use of reg.exe with command lines adding registry entries. Specifically, Discord is setting values in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and creating a new protocol handler under Classes\\Discord. This looks like an attempt to set up persistence mechanisms. The first registry change points to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\Update.exe\" which then runs Discord.exe when the user logs in. That's a common tactic for malware or unwanted software to ensure it starts on boot.\n\nThe second reg.exe command creates a URL protocol handler for \"Discord Protocol\", which could allow Discord to handle links like discord:\/\/something, but in this context, it seems suspicious because it's part of an automated process without user interaction. This might be a way to inject itself into system processes or gain higher privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating registry entries for persistence and setting up protocol handlers suggests potential malicious activity. While Discord is a legitimate app, these actions could also be used by malware. The high number of ProcessAccess events from Update.exe adds to the concern because such repeated accesses are uncommon in normal operations.\n\nI'm pretty confident that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior, especially with the registry modifications and multiple process creations\/accesses. So, I'd classify this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events indicating Discord.exe modifying system configurations via registry changes and creating persistence mechanisms, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's see... The logs are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking through the first few entries, they're all from \"Discord.exe\". They mention tasks like \"Pipe Created\" and \"Process accessed.\" I know Discord is a chat application that sometimes can be involved in security incidents, but just having multiple instances of it running might not be suspicious on its own. It could just be normal operations.\n\nThen, there are events where \"reg.exe\" is used with commands adding entries to the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That seems a bit more concerning because modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities like creating persistence points or changing file associations. For example, setting a URL protocol handler could allow executing code when a specific link is clicked.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple \"Process Create\" events for both Discord and reg.exe. While it's normal for applications to start processes, the combination here might be worth looking into. Specifically, the command lines show that reg.exe is being used to modify the registry in several ways—setting default icons, shell commands, etc. This kind of activity could be indicative of a malicious script trying to set up persistence or change how Discord behaves.\n\nThere are also events where \"Update.exe\" creates a shortcut in the Start Menu and accesses processes. I'm not sure what Update.exe is supposed to do normally. If it's part of an update mechanism, creating shortcuts might be legitimate, but without more context, it could also be suspicious if it's modifying the system's startup behavior.\n\nThe logs show multiple \"Process terminated\" events for Discord.exe as well. This could just be normal cleanup after operations, or it might be part of a process injection technique where malicious code starts and stops processes to avoid detection.\n\nI'm also noticing several file-related events, like loading DLLs. While this is common for applications, the specific DLLs being loaded (like ffmpeg.dll) are typically used by Discord itself, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity around modifying the registry and creating processes using reg.exe. This kind of behavior can be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like reg.exe to make changes that allow persistence or alter system behaviors. Additionally, multiple attempts to modify Discord's settings in the registry might indicate someone trying to hijack its functionality.\n\nHowever, it's possible that this is just Discord itself updating or changing its configuration during runtime. I'm not entirely sure without more context on what Discord's normal behavior entails regarding registry modifications. If these events are part of an update or a legitimate script run by Discord, then they might not be suspicious. But if the timing coincides with other unusual activities (like failed logins, network connections to unknown domains), it could be malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because while individual actions might seem normal, the combination and frequency—especially using reg.exe multiple times—could indicate something more nefarious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications using reg.exe targeting Discord settings suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at the logs provided.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries where the process name is \"Update.exe\". The tasks associated with these processes are mostly things like ProcessAccess and FileCreate, but nothing immediately suspicious jumps out. For example, one log shows a file being created: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk\". A .lnk file is a Windows shortcut, which isn't inherently malicious, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThen there are some Registry value sets and Process termination events for Update.exe. Malicious processes often interact with the registry to maintain persistence or to inject code into other processes. So these could be red flags, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nLooking further down, there are entries related to Discord.exe. The logs show various activities like Dns query, Pipe Created, and Image loaded events. One log includes a detailed command line for Discord.exe with parameters that look standard for Discord's operation, including paths and arguments for GPU processes and user data directories. This seems normal because Discord is a legitimate application.\n\nHowever, I notice that some of these logs show process creations and accesses, which could be part of legitimate operations or could indicate an attacker using the system. The combination of \"Update.exe\" activities and Discord-related processes might raise eyebrows if they occur together in a way that's unusual for typical user behavior.\n\nAnother point is the frequency: there are multiple entries of Update.exe accessing processes and files. If this activity is happening more than usual, it could indicate something amiss. Additionally, the creation of a .lnk file on the desktop might be an attempt to create a shortcut for malicious purposes, but again, without knowing the user's normal behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some activities that could potentially be suspicious—like registry modifications and process termination—it's possible these are part of legitimate updates or system operations. The presence of Discord processes doesn't add immediate concern unless they're interacting with malicious components mentioned elsewhere. \n\nGiven the uncertainty without more context and considering that these events could be part of normal system behavior, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\".

Then there's an event where a shortcut (Discord.lnk) is being created on the desktop and another in the Start Menu.\n\nI remember that these kinds of activities are pretty normal for applications, especially Discord which likely uses such processes to run smoothly. The creation of shortcuts might be part of its setup or update process.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and involve standard operations without any signs of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or interaction with unexpected files or network activities, there's no red flag here.\n\nSo, considering everything, this batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior.

All the entries are from a single process, \"Discord.exe\", which is Discord's main executable. The tasks logged include things like ProcessAccess, Pipe Created, and ImageLoad.\n\nI notice that there are multiple instances where reg.exe is being used with command lines adding registry keys related to the Discord protocol. This seems out of place because Discord typically doesn't modify system-wide settings through reg.exe in such a way. It might be trying to set itself as a default handler for URLs, which could indicate some kind of persistence or unwanted behavior.\n\nThe repetition of these actions—like creating pipes and accessing processes—could be part of a legitimate process but also raises flags. Processes creating multiple named pipes can sometimes be used by malware for inter-process communication. The command line parameters in the reg.exe commands are adding entries to HKCU, which is user-specific, so it's possible this is an attempt to modify only the current user's settings.\n\nI'm concerned because legitimate apps usually don't inject themselves into system processes or modify registry settings in such a way. Also, the use of reg.exe directly from the command line without being part of Discord's usual update mechanism might be suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while some events are normal for an application like Discord, the repeated registration attempts and process creations could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the use of reg.exe in two separate events. Reg.exe is a legitimate Windows tool for editing the registry, but it's often used by malware to make persistent changes. In both cases, they're adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord and HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord\\shell\\open\\command. That seems suspicious because Discord usually doesn't modify its own registry entries in such a way during normal operation.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from Discord.exe itself. It's accessing the process, creating pipes, making network connections, and querying DNS multiple times. While some of this is normal for an application that communicates over the internet, the frequency might be worth looking into. Also, the command line parameters in one event show that Discord is being run with various flags, including --type=utility and --service-sandbox-type=service. That's a bit unusual because I don't recall Discord typically running with such options unless it's part of an update or a different process.\n\nAnother red flag is the file operations. There are events where Discord.exe is accessing temporary files, like Google.Widevine.CDM.dll in C:\\Users\\...Local\\Temp. This could be related to downloading content or updates, but sometimes malicious software uses similar tactics to drop files or execute them.\n\nLooking at the timestamps would help determine if these activities happened within a short period, which could indicate an attack. But without that context, it's hard to say for sure. However, the combination of registry modifications by reg.exe and unusual process activity from Discord.exe suggests potential malicious behavior. The multiple network connections and DNS queries might be part of communication with external servers, possibly command-and-control.\n\nI'm also considering whether this could be a false positive, like a legitimate update or script running in the background.

All of them are from the same process named Discord.exe. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events mention \"Network connection detected\" with the rule NetworkConnect. That seems normal because applications like Discord need to connect to their servers. I see seven such events in a row. Then, there's an event where the task is \"Process terminated,\" which happens when Discord closes or crashes. After that, another event shows \"Registry value set\" under the RegistryEvent rule. Finally, one more network connection detection follows.\n\nI need to consider if this combination is unusual. Well, Discord being a chat application, it's expected for it to make network connections. The process termination and registry changes are also standard operations for an app starting up or running normally. Since all events are from the same process and don't indicate any signs of tampering or multiple failed attempts, they don't raise any red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs don't show any malicious behavior.
