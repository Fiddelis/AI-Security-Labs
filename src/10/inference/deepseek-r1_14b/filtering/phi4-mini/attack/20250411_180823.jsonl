{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nSo, looking at the JSONL data, each line represents an event with process info, windows log task, and sometimes a file path. The first few events are from chrome.exe doing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of that for browsing. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so I need to pay attention here. Maybe it's legitimate admin work or something malicious trying to hide.\n\nNext, calc.exe loading an image with urlmon.dll. Wait, why would Calculator load that? That seems odd because I don't think Calculator typically uses URL functions much. Could be a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. SvcHost is part of Windows services, but it's often used by malware to hide their processes. Multiple registry changes could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen cmd.exe runs some commands creating scheduled tasks with schtasks. The command lines have \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" which means they're trying to execute Calculator in a way that might persist across reboots. Creating scheduled tasks on startup or logon sounds suspicious because it's a common persistence technique for malware.\n\nAnother event is conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe also setting registry values. Conhost is usually related to console windows, but if it's modifying the registry without clear reason, that could be bad.\n\nCalculator.exe is involved multiple times too. It's loading urlmon.dll again, which doesn't seem normal for a calculator app. Maybe it's being used as part of a payload or to execute malicious code.\n\nPutting it all together: there are signs of process creation (cmd and schtasks), registry modifications (svchost, powershell, etc.), and attempts to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe on startup\/logon. These behaviors are often seen in persistence mechanisms used by malware. The use of multiple tools like cmd, powershell, and schtasks could be indicators of an attack.\n\nI'm a bit unsure because some events might be legitimate (like chrome's network activities), but the combination of process creations, registry changes, and scheduled tasks pointing to calc.exe is concerning. It feels like this batch shows potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell usage, creation of scheduled tasks with cmd.exe commands to execute calc.exe, and registry modifications by svchost.exe, indicating possible malware persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if this batch as a whole is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from chrome.exe doing various things like creating pipes and setting registry values multiple times. That seems pretty standard because Chrome is a common application that interacts with system resources regularly. It's possible Chrome is just updating settings or extensions, which isn't unusual.\n\nThere are also some events from winlogbeat.exe. One of them is about a file being created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used for log shipping, so it's normal for it to create configuration files in such directories. No red flags there.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe creating a file called unidade_ativo.txt. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but not all uses are malicious. Creating a file could be part of script execution or data processing. However, the filename seems benign and doesn't immediately raise suspicion.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is executed with command line parameters, which is a common system utility to check user permissions. This event alone isn't concerning unless it's used in an unusual context, but here it looks like standard usage.\n\nI also see multiple registry writes from chrome.exe, which again seems normal for application updates or configuration changes. No signs of unexpected activity there.\n\nPutting this all together, while each individual action might look suspicious on its own (like using PowerShell or whoami), the combination doesn't indicate malicious behavior. The events are spread out across different processes but don't show any unusual patterns, such as multiple writes to sensitive registry areas, file creation in system directories, or repeated attempts to access restricted resources.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards this batch not being interesting for further investigation since all activities seem within normal operational parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard user activity, including Chrome registry modifications and legitimate file operations by winlogbeat.exe. PowerShell actions are benign, and whoami.exe execution is typical.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
