{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations and network connections from chrome.exe. That's normal because browsers do connect to the internet frequently. There are multiple instances of Network connection detected, which could just be regular browsing activity.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe being used with a command line argument to create notepad.exe. This might seem suspicious at first glance because using command-line tools can sometimes indicate malicious activity. However, in this case, it seems like a legitimate process creation since notepad.exe is a common application and the command line isn't executing anything malicious.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe appears multiple times but without any unusual commands attached. PowerShell is often used for both good and bad purposes, but without specific indicators of compromise (like known malicious scripts or commands), it's hard to classify these as suspicious.\n\nThere are several instances where processes like WMIC.exe and svchost.exe are loading legitimate system files (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, etc.). These activities are typical for these processes and don't raise red flags on their own since they're part of standard operations.\n\nRegistry value sets by various processes could be normal administrative tasks or updates. Without specific registry keys being modified that are known to be targeted in attacks, this doesn't seem concerning.\n\nThe appearance of whoami.exe is another common tool used for legitimate purposes, such as checking user permissions, so it's not unusual here.\n\nOverall, while there are several events that could individually look suspicious, when considered together they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior. Each event seems to be within the realm of normal system operations or benign activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal process creations and network connections typical of user activity, with no evident signs of malicious behavior such as unusual file accesses or known indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
