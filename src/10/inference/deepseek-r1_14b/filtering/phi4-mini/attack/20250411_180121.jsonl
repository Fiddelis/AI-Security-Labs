Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. These could be normal browsing activities, so on their own, they might not raise a red flag unless they seem unusual or excessive.\n\nThen, I see multiple powershell.exe processes with command lines that involve downloading files using WebClient. The URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com, which isn't inherently malicious but is often used for hosting scripts. However, the repeated pattern of downloading files and creating temporary script files named things like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" raises concern because such activities are common in malicious scripts to bypass certain policy checks.\n\nLooking closer, each powershell.exe event has a command line that downloads a file from GitHub and saves it to the Temp directory. This is a classic technique used by malware or attackers to execute arbitrary code on a system. The fact that this happens multiple times with different paths and filenames suggests a possible script running in a loop or multiple instances trying to download files, which could indicate an infection.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where these powershell.exe processes set registry values, load images (DLLs), create pipes, and manipulate files. These actions can be indicative of process injection, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network, all of which are signs of potential malicious activity.\n\nThe combination of downloading files from GitHub via PowerShell, creating temporary script files, and modifying the system's registry and file structure points towards a possible attack vector. While some of these activities could be legitimate, the frequency and the specific actions taken make it more likely that this batch is malicious or at least suspicious.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events together, there's a strong indication that this batch is relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are downloading files from GitHub using WebClient, creating temporary scripts, and modifying system components.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nStarting with the first three events, all are from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal since browsers often interact with the registry for settings. Not a red flag yet.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process downloading a file from GitHub into %TEMP%. That's suspicious because downloading files from unknown sources can indicate malicious activity. I should note that this could be part of an attack.\n\nThen, another powershell.exe event shows creating a file in the StartupProfileData folder. This is concerning because writing to non-standard locations, especially with PowerShell, often is used by attackers for persistence or dropping malware.\n\nLooking at conhost.exe accessing the registry, it's usually benign but sometimes used by malicious scripts to hide processes. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating configuration files seems normal if it's part of log management setup. But repeated file creations might be worth checking to ensure nothing is being written abnormally.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing the registry again—this repetition could indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms, which are red flags for malware.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe also show registry activity. These processes can sometimes be involved in malicious activities because they're part of legitimate system services but can be abused.\n\nThere's a calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is unusual since Calculator typically doesn't interact with DLLs related to URL handling. This could suggest process injection or malware using standard tools for malicious purposes.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution and cmd.exe deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" are concerning. Deleting tasks via command line can be part of an attacker's cleanup routine after establishing persistence.\n\nMultiple cmd.exe processes showing registry writes—cmd is a common tool but repeated writes might indicate scripting activity trying to hide or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several indicators that could point to malicious activities: downloading files from suspicious sources, creating new files in unusual locations, repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe commands with potential malicious intent, and deletions of scheduled tasks. These patterns suggest a possible attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potentially malicious activities, such as downloading files from an external source, creating unexpected files in user directories, and deleting scheduled tasks which may be part of a larger attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the deletion of a scheduled task using schtasks.exe. That might be suspicious because deleting tasks could indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. Next, there's another schtasks event about loading the taskschd.dll, which seems normal since that's part of Task Scheduler.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe accessing the registry and setting values. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities, especially if they're trying to hide traces or create persistence points. There are also instances where conhost.exe is involved in registry changes. Conhost is often used by attackers for command-line access, so that's a red flag.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with different log types—accessed, image loaded, and setting registry values. Powershell is commonly abused by attackers for execution of malicious scripts, so repeated activity here could be concerning. There are also events where cmd.exe deletes specific registry entries under HKCU\\Run, which might mean an attacker is trying to remove evidence or disable certain behaviors.\n\nLooking further, there's a reg.exe command deleting another registry key. Reg.exe is often used in attacks for similar purposes as cmd, so that adds more suspicion. The process creation events for various tools like whoami.exe could be part of reconnaissance activities, perhaps checking user information.\n\nI also notice some entries where the command line for powershell.exe includes \"& {}\", which might indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or obfuscate commands. Additionally, there are multiple image load events from Powershell loading various DLLs, which is normal but when combined with other suspicious behaviors, raises concern.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch shows a series of activities that could be part of an attack chain: deleting tasks, modifying and deleting registry entries (possibly to remove persistence or evidence), using tools like cmd.exe and conhost for command execution, and extensive use of Powershell which is often used in attacks. These events happening together suggest potential malicious activity rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks, and the use of tools commonly associated with malicious behavior (schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking through the JSONL data, most of the events involve powershell.exe doing various things like loading images, creating files, deleting them, and accessing registry values. There are also some instances where other processes like cmd.exe and whoami.exe are involved, but they seem to be more isolated.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. The events show file creations and deletions in temporary directories, which might be part of script execution. For example, there's a file path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 being created and then deleted shortly after. This pattern could indicate that the script is being tested or maybe it's part of some obfuscation technique.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading different DLLs like MpOAV.dll and mscoréei.dll. While these might be legitimate, sometimes attackers load malicious modules or bypass detection by using legitimate processes to execute code.\n\nThere are also several Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag because attackers often use this method to ensure their malware persists across reboots.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\" could suggest that the script is being called repeatedly or in a loop, which might be indicative of a script trying different things or waiting for certain conditions. This repetition might not be normal and could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nHowever, I also see some legitimate processes mixed in, like whoami.exe and cmd.exe, which are typically used for basic system operations. The use of winlogbeat.exe is another indicator that this could be part of log management, which is normal unless there's an unusual volume or access pattern.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are some concerning activities—like file creation\/deletion in temp directories and registry modifications—the fact that it's primarily from a single user account (fiddelis) and the processes don't show signs of high privilege escalation or direct indicators of compromise makes me lean towards it not being an immediate threat. It might just be a system administrator running scripts for legitimate purposes, especially since some events are related to Powershell's own operations like engine lifecycle and provider lifecycles.\n\nBut I'm still cautious because powershell.exe is such a versatile tool for attackers. The combination of file creation\/deletion and registry changes without obvious purpose could warrant further investigation. However, based on the information provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond potential suspicious behavior that needs to be assessed in context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate PowerShell operations, including file and registry interactions, which do not indicate malicious activity. Although some actions could be suspicious, there is no clear evidence of a security threat without additional context.\",\n  \"DETAILED_REASONING\": \"The events show normal system behavior with frequent PowerShell executions, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications, which are common in script-based operations.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events, and I need to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are coming from powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so any unusual activity here could be concerning. \n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are several ImageLoad events where specific DLLs are being loaded. For example, one event loads 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\clrjit.dll'. This seems normal because these are standard .NET framework components that powershell would typically use. However, I should check if these paths are legitimate or if they're being loaded from unexpected locations.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a file in the Temp directory: 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1'. This is interesting because it's a PowerShell script being created in a temporary folder, which could be part of a test or setup by malicious code. Additionally, this file is deleted shortly after being created in another event marked as FileDeleteDetected. The creation and immediate deletion might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother significant point is the use of whoami.exe. This tool is often used to gather information about the user running the process, which could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance. In this case, it's being executed without any unusual command-line arguments, but its presence alongside powershell activity might raise flags.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent tasks where values are being set in Chrome.exe and other processes. While Chrome can make registry changes as part of its operation, the frequency here seems high. It could be related to legitimate updates or it might be an indicator of a malicious process using registry keys for persistence or configuration.\n\nI also notice that some powershell.exe instances are started with specific command lines. For example, one starts with \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This command is deleting a file in the Temp directory if it exists. The use of ErrorAction Ignore might be to suppress any errors if the file isn't present, which is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several red flags:\n1. Powershell.exe creating and immediately deleting temporary script files.\n2. Multiple registry modifications from different processes, especially Chrome.exe, which seems unusual for a browser process.\n3. Use of whoami.exe, which could be part of lateral movement or data gathering.\n4. The command to delete a specific file in the Temp directory without error handling.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The deletion of temporary files and registry modifications are common tactics in malware to clean up traces of their actions. Additionally, powershell is often abused for its execution capabilities, making it a key indicator in many attack scenarios.\n\nI should also consider if all these activities could be part of legitimate processes. For instance, the use of .NET DLLs by powershell is normal, and Chrome registry entries might be part of updates or extensions. However, the volume and specific actions—like file creation\/deletion and whoami usage—make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nTherefore, I would assess that this log batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior, especially focusing on the powershell.exe activities which could indicate command execution or script downloading.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided log events indicates a potential security concern. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Powershell Activity**: The extensive use of powershell.exe is notable. While it's a legitimate tool, its execution in combination with other actions can be suspicious. Powershell was used to create and delete temporary script files, which may suggest an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\n2. **File Operations**: Temporary files were created and immediately deleted. This behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection by removing evidence of their presence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple registry entries were modified, including those from Chrome.exe. While some modifications are normal, the frequency and context suggest possible malicious activity, such as creating persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Use of whoami.exe**: The execution of whoami.exe could indicate an attempt to gather system information, potentially part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities.\n\n5. **Command Execution**: A specific command was used to delete a file in the Temp directory without error handling, which is common in malware to suppress errors and avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of powershell activity, temporary file manipulation, registry modifications, and the use of whoami.exe suggests potential malicious behavior. This log batch should be investigated further to determine if a security incident has occurred or if ongoing malicious activities are taking place."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs. The events are all in JSONL format, each with process, winlog, and file details. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, multiple entries show powershell.exe being used. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. They're loading images and creating files. For example, there's a file created in the Temp folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Temporary script files can be suspicious, especially if they're deleted right after creation, which this batch shows happening.\n\nI notice several Remove-Item commands in the command lines. These are deleting files from the TEMP directory, specifically .zip and .txt files. Deleting files could be part of cleaning up evidence, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection. The fact that multiple files are being deleted across different events makes me think it's intentional.\n\nThere are also registry value sets and process accesses logged. Malware often manipulates the registry to maintain persistence or disable security features. The use of whoami.exe could be to check system information, which is a common step for attackers to understand their environment before moving further.\n\nThe combination of these activities—using PowerShell, creating and deleting temporary files, manipulating registry entries, and using whoami.exe—is concerning. It aligns with behaviors seen in malicious scripts aiming to delete evidence or modify system configurations.\n\nWhile not all PowerShell use is bad, the pattern here suggests potential malicious activity. The high number of deletions and the specific file paths being accessed make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe processes creating temporary files in C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, which are immediately deleted.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries from powershell.exe. The first few logs show tasks like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. These don't immediately sound bad, but I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the files being accessed: mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll—those are part of .NET Framework, which is standard. Then there's a Native Image called mscorlib.ni.dll, also normal. But then it accesses MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender—that seems suspicious because defender files shouldn't be accessed by scripts unless something's wrong.\n\nNext, I see a file creation event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 in the temp directory. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's odd. Why create and delete a script so quickly? Maybe trying to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple command lines where powershell.exe is removing files from TEMP with specific names like 'registro_auxiliar.txt'. The command line syntax uses curly braces in the script block—sometimes that's used for obfuscation or to execute code without saving it. Also, using Remove-Item with Force and ignoring errors could mean they're trying to clean up traces.\n\nAnother event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a config file—probably not related unless it's part of an attack on the logging system.\n\nI notice a process named whoami.exe being created. That's a standard tool for getting user info, but if it's run by another script, maybe it's used to escalate privileges or gather credentials.\n\nThere are several registry writes from chrome.exe—maybe normal activity, but if there's a lot, could indicate tampering or persistence attempts.\n\nPutting this together: repeated PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion of scripts, removal of temp files, and use of whoami suggests potential malicious behavior. The quick script creation and deletion might be an attempt to hide evidence. The registry writes from Chrome could be unrelated or part of a broader attack vector.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because the pattern looks evasive and potentially malicious. Confidence is about 0.85 because while some actions are suspicious, others like .NET files are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including script creation\/deletion, file removals, and registry modifications, indicating potential evasion or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events are from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings. So, nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe also setting a registry value. I know that Runtime Broker is related to UWP app containerization, so it's not unusual for it to access the registry either.\n\nNow, looking at powershell.exe events: they're being accessed multiple times. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so repeated accesses might be a red flag. But in this case, the task is just 'Process accessed', which is pretty generic, so I'm not sure if that's concerning yet.\n\nThere are several instances of whoami.exe being run with command lines pointing to system32. Whoami is a standard tool used by admins and scripts to get user information. The fact that it's being called multiple times might be normal, especially in an environment where scripts or tools are running checks on the system. But again, depending on the context, this could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the later events: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack for log management, so that's expected behavior. No issues there.\n\nThen there are multiple FileCreate tasks from powershell.exe and another one creating a .txt file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. Creating files can be normal, but the filename seems generic. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events seem benign. Chrome, RuntimeBroker, whoami, and winlogbeat are doing what they normally do. The repeated PowerShell accesses could be a point of concern, but since they're just being accessed and not executing commands, maybe it's part of some script or process monitoring. The file creation by PowerShell is also within the realm of normal activity unless there's evidence that these files are malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually, each event doesn't raise a red flag, and collectively, they don't indicate any obvious malicious behavior. But I'm not 100% certain because PowerShell is often used in attacks, so maybe more context would be needed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity with no clear signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
