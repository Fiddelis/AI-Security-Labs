There are multiple entries about file creations and deletions involving setup.exe and other update-related files. This seems normal as part of the software update process.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's CompatTelRunner.exe, which is known for compatibility tasks, and services.exe, which is a system process. SvcHost.exe appears several times, which is common for various Windows services. The presence of MpCmdRun.exe relates to antivirus operations, which is standard behavior.\n\nThere are multiple events labeled as \"User Account Management,\" but without specific actions, it's hard to tell if they're significant. However, the taskhostw.exe and chrome.exe entries don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nOne event stands out: a PowerShell command executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. This is a bit concerning because even though the script is checking for INF files, it might be a precursor to more malicious activities. Sandboxed execution could mask malicious behavior, so this warrants closer inspection.\n\nOverall, while most events are routine system and update activity, the PowerShell execution with restricted policies adds some intrigue. It's possible that this is part of legitimate scripting, but it could also indicate an attempt at hiding malicious code.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell command executed with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which may indicate potential script-based activity that could be malicious or suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me look at each event.\n\nFirst, there are several events where \"MpCmdRun.exe\" is the process name. This file is associated with Windows Defender, which is legitimate. The tasks include creating files and loading images from known Microsoft paths. So these seem normal.\n\nThen, I see multiple events from \"git.exe\". Each of these is a file creation event under a node_modules directory for 'semver'. Git is commonly used in development environments to clone or manage repositories. Creating files here is typical during development work, especially with Node.js modules. The paths look standard for a project structure.\n\nI don't notice any signs of malicious activity like unknown processes, unusual file names, or writes to system directories. All the actions are related to legitimate software and expected behavior in a user's environment. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal activities: Windows Defender processes loading legitimate files and Git creating files during development.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the logs, each event seems to be generated by the same process, \"git.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created on the system. The files are located in various paths under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\" and include modules like node_modules with specific JavaScript files, package.json, LICENSEs, README.md, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's normal. When a user is working on a project that uses Node.js, they might clone a repository which includes various npm packages. Git operations are common during this process, including cloning, fetching, and installing dependencies. Each time a file is created as part of the package installation or when initializing a new project, these events would naturally occur.\n\nThe paths listed under node_modules include semver, serialize-javascript, set-blocking, and set-function-length. These are all known npm packages that get installed when running commands like npm install. The presence of these files being created by git.exe suggests that the user is performing operations related to version control on their Node.js project.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, paths pointing to system directories, or executables outside the expected modules. All the files are within a user's downloads directory and are typical for a development environment using Git and npm.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't indicate anything suspicious. It looks like standard development activities rather than any malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by git.exe during Node.js module installations, which is expected in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I see that all the entries are from \"git.exe\" and involve files being created in a Node.js module directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules.\n\nEach event shows a file creation task, with varying file paths under node_modules. The files include package.json, index.js, LICENSE.txt, and others typical of npm packages like signal-exit, slice-ansi, and sshpk. These are all standard Node.js modules used in software development for tasks such as handling signals, slicing ANSI escape codes, and managing SSH keys.\n\nGiven that these events are related to a user installing or updating Node.js packages, it's normal activity during development. There's nothing indicating malicious behavior hereâ€”no signs of unauthorized access, suspicious file executions, or indicators of compromise. The process is straightforward and expected in a dev environment.\n\nSo, this batch doesn't raise any red flags for potential security issues. It seems like legitimate actions taken by the user while working on their project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creations during a git operation in a Node.js development environment, which is normal and expected activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. All the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that each event has three main components: process details, Windows log information, and file details. The process name in every event is \"git.exe.\" The Windows log task indicates that a file was created, triggered by a rule named \"FileCreate.\" The file paths all seem to be within the \"node_modules\" directory of a specific folder structure related to a course on software quality.\n\nFor example, one event shows that git.exe created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\sshpk\\lib\\formats\\rfc4253.js.\" Another event does the same for different files within the node_modules directory, like \"x509-pem.js\" and \"private-key.js.\" There are also entries related to man pages under \"man\/man1,\" such as \"sshpk-conv.1\" and \"sshpk-sign.1,\" which suggests these might be manual pages for some SSH-related tools.\n\nContinuing through the events, I notice that a variety of files are being created: .js files, .json package files, license files, and readme.md files. All these are typical components of a Node.js module setup. The paths also include directories like \"strip-ansi,\" \"strip-final-newline,\" and \"strip-json-comments,\" which are all well-known npm packages.\n\nGiven that the process is git.exe and it's creating files within a node_modules directory, this seems indicative of someone cloning or setting up a Git repository, installing Node.js packages. The user might be working on a project related to software quality, as indicated by the course name \"S206 - Qualidade de Software,\" which translates to \"Software Quality\" in Portuguese.\n\nI'm considering if these actions are normal. Using Git to clone repositories and then installing dependencies with npm is standard for developers setting up projects. The creation of files like package.json and readme.md, along with license files, is typical during the setup process.\n\nIs there anything unusual here? Well, git.exe is associated with GitHub or Git operations, but since it's being used in a development context, especially within node_modules, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags. The file paths don't seem to indicate any malicious activity like accessing restricted directories or creating hidden files. All the actions are within expected areas for software development.\n\nI might be concerned if there were attempts to execute scripts immediately after downloading them or if there were multiple failed login attempts, but that's not the case here. Each event is simply a file creation, which is part of the normal setup process when working with version control systems and package managers.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these activities could be part of automated processes or CI\/CD pipelines. In such environments, Git operations and npm installs are common, so even more reason that this isn't suspicious.\n\nI also note that all events happen in quick succession, which might suggest a script or tool being used to set up the project environment, but again, this is within normal operational activities for a developer or build system.\n\nGiven all this, I don't see any signs of malicious intent or security breaches. The actions are consistent with legitimate software development practices.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events does not indicate suspicious activity. All events involve standard operations related to setting up a Node.js project using Git and npm. \n\n**Classification:** NOT INTERESTING  \n**Justification:** These logs represent normal activities associated with software development, specifically cloning repositories and installing dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or unauthorized access.  \n**Confidence Score:** 0.85 (High confidence due to typical development patterns.)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"NOT_INTERESTING\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events represent normal software development activities, such as cloning repositories and installing Node.js packages, with no indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. All the JSON objects are similar; each one has a \"process\" field indicating that git.exe is running. The \"winlog\" shows that a file was created under the rule FileCreate. The files being created all have paths like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\...\\... \n\nHmm, node_modules is a directory typically used in Node.js projects to store dependencies. The filenames include things like license, readme.md, index.js, changelog.md, etc., which are all standard for npm packages. Each event shows git.exe creating these files, probably during a clone or fetch operation of a Git repository that includes Node.js modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no unusual file creation in system directories, no hidden files, or anything related to known malware behavior. It looks like normal development activitiesâ€” someone might be working on a project that uses Git and Node.js, installing dependencies which would involve creating these files.\n\nThe process name is git.exe, so it's definitely a legitimate operation related to version control. The fact that all events are from the same user (fiddelis) and in the same directory structure makes me think this is just someone working on their code.\n\nNo indicators of compromise like writes to system32 or other restricted areas, no suspicious file hashes, or any unexpected processes. It's consistent with a user developing software normally.\n\nSo overall, I don't see any reason to flag this as interesting for investigation.

It seems like git.exe is creating multiple files in a node_modules directory. Node modules are part of JavaScript package installations, so this looks like normal npm or yarn activity during development.\n\nIs there any sign of malicious behavior? No. All events are about files being created by a legitimate process (git) in a typical location for development tools. There's no indication of unusual access times, permissions changes, or other red flags.\n\nConsidering all these points, this batch doesn't show anything suspicious. It's just standard file creation during the setup of a project using git and node modules.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events indicate that `git.exe` is creating multiple files in a Node.js module directory, which aligns with normal development activities rather than malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe within a typical node_modules directory, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
