That seems routine unless there's an unusual pattern, but alone, it doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nThen I see \"Special Logon\" events. These usually occur during user logins and are standard in logs, so no immediate concern.\n\nThere are several instances where processes like taskhostw.exe and powershell.exe load taskschd.dll. Since these are legitimate system files, this activity is expected and not malicious.\n\nThe event with winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file might be part of log shipping tools and isn't concerning unless it's unexpected in the environment.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe activities are related to Windows Defender, which is normal for antivirus operations. The creation of lock files could be part of its process.\n\nLastly, git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory looks like a user running Git commands locally, which is entirely expected if the system has developers or dev tools installed.\n\nPutting it all together, these events don't show any signs of malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the structure and content of each event. Every entry has three main fields: \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and \"file.\" \n\nThe \"process\" field consistently shows {\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, indicating that the Git command-line tool was involved in these events. The \"winlog\" task is described as \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" which means each event is a notification of a file creation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\". This seems to be a directory within the user's Downloads folder, possibly related to their studies or work projects since it includes \"Qualidade de Software\" (Software Quality in Portuguese). The files being created are inside the \"node_modules\\\\semver\\\\\" directory. \n\nThe specific filenames vary but include functions like diff.js, gt.js, lt.js, minor.js, etc., which are typical for a semver package. Semver is a Node.js module used for semantic versioning. The presence of internal files like constants.js, debug.js, and package.json further confirms that these are part of the semver module's structure.\n\nConsidering the context, Git is often used in development environments to manage code and dependencies. When a user clones a repository or updates their project, Node modules are installed, which involves creating these files. The repeated file creation events likely correspond to the installation process of the semver package using npm (Node Package Manager).\n\nNow, I need to assess whether this batch is interesting for investigation. Since all events involve the same process (git.exe), the same task (file creation), and are located in a standard Node modules directory, there's nothing unusual here. These activities are expected during normal software development or project setup.\n\nThere's no indication of any malicious behavior, such as files being created in unexpected locations, access to restricted areas, or execution of suspicious processes. The file paths are legitimate, and the actions align with typical user activity when managing dependencies.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these events could be part of a larger pattern that might indicate something nefarious. For example, if multiple similar events occur across different directories or involve unusual files, they might warrant closer inspection. But in this case, all events are confined to the semver module, which is a well-known and widely used package.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of these events. If the system logs show an unusually high number of file creations in a short period, it could be a sign of something malicious like a DDoS attack or a data exfiltration attempt. However, here we have 18 events, each creating a specific file under the same directory, which is consistent with a normal npm install operation.\n\nAdditionally, since all events are related to the Git process and Node modules, it's possible that the user was working on a project that requires semver for versioning. This would make these log entries entirely expected and benign.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no evidence of malicious activity or anomalies in this batch of logs. The file creations are part of standard software development practices, specifically related to installing a package dependency. Therefore, investigating these events further doesn't seem necessary unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events provided is not considered interesting for investigation as they represent normal and expected activities during the installation of a Node.js package (semver) using Git in a development environment. The repeated file creation events under the node_modules directory are typical and do not indicate any malicious or unusual behavior.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe entire batch of events is **not interesting** for further investigation as they represent normal software development activities, specifically the installation of a Node.js package, which does not indicate any security concerns."}

Each line is a JSON object representing some event on the system. The user mentioned that these are in JSONL format, which stands for JSON Lines, meaning each line is its own separate JSON object.\n\nFirst, I notice that every single event has the same process name: \"git.exe\". That's interesting because git is commonly used for version control and isn't typically associated with malicious activities. Also, all of these events are Windows log events related to files being created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all located under a user directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This looks like a standard path for user downloads and projects. The specific files being created are within node_modules folders, which suggests that this is related to a Node.js project setup or installation.\n\nBreaking down the file paths, each one is part of different npm packages. For example, there's serialize-javascript, set-blocking, set-function-length, shebang-regex, and side-channel. These are all legitimate npm packages used in JavaScript development. The fact that these files are being created under node_modules indicates that something like npm install might be running, which downloads and installs these dependencies.\n\nThe tasks mentioned in each event are \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so the system is logging each time a new file is created. Since all of these are part of standard Node.js package installations, this activity doesn't raise any red flags related to security or malicious behavior. It's just normal software development or setup activities.\n\nI also notice that the events span multiple files across different packages, which makes sense when you're installing several dependencies at once. There's a consistent pattern in the file paths and the types of files being created—README.md, package.json, index.js, etc.—all typical for npm modules.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's no indication of anything suspicious or out of the ordinary. The activities are entirely consistent with someone setting up or working on a Node.js project using git as the version control system. There's nothing unusual in the file types being created or the locations where they're being placed.\n\nI should also think about whether such activity could be part of a larger malicious process, but given that each file is a legitimate package and there's no variation in the process name, it doesn't seem likely. If this were an attack, I'd expect to see more varied processes or access patterns outside of standard development activities.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these events together, they don't seem interesting from a security standpoint. They're entirely normal and expected when someone is working on a Node.js project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of file creation events by git.exe during the setup or installation of legitimate Node.js packages, which is typical for software development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

That suggests that Git is being used here, possibly for version control or other tasks related to code repositories. The task in each event is \"File created,\" which means a new file was made on the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the \"node_modules\" directory. This indicates that these files are part of a Node.js project's dependencies. Specifically, I see modules like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, and others.

There's nothing unusual here; it's typical for package managers and version control systems to create files as part of the setup process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity. The paths are legitimate, and the actions being taken by Git are expected during development work.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 18 of them in total. The common element across all these logs is the process name \"git.exe\" and the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". \n\nSo, the first thing that comes to mind is understanding what's happening here. Git is a version control system widely used by developers for code management. When you clone a repository or extract files using git, it creates new files in specific directories. The file paths mentioned all point to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\", which is a typical location where Node.js modules are stored. \n\nLooking at the files being created, I see various JavaScript files (like index.js), TypeScript definition files (index.d.ts), package.json files, README.md, LICENSE, and some changelog files. These are all standard components of a Node.js module. For instance, package.json is essential for managing dependencies and project metadata.\n\nThe process name git.exe suggests that Git is being used to create these files, possibly during an npm install operation where dependencies are fetched and extracted into node_modules. This is a common occurrence when setting up or updating a Node.js project. \n\nI'm considering whether this activity is unusual. Given that it's all happening under the user's Downloads directory and within a structured folder named after a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"), it seems like this could be part of a legitimate software development workflow, perhaps for a class or personal project.\n\nAre there any red flags? The use of git.exe in creating multiple files in node_modules might raise an eyebrow if seen out of context. However, without additional context indicating malicious activity—such as file creation times outside normal hours, unusual file names, or attempts to execute these files—it doesn't seem suspicious here.\n\nI also note that each event is identical in structure except for the file path, which suggests a repetitive and expected process rather than something malicious like multiple varied activities from different sources. The repetition of \"File created\" events with git.exe as the process indicates it's part of a script or automated setup, which is typical in development environments.\n\nIn summary, all these events point to legitimate file creation during a Node.js module installation, likely triggered by a Git operation. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious behavior here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory, which is normal during npm installs or project setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
