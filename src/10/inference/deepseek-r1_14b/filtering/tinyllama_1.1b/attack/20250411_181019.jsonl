{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few PowerShell.exe processes being accessed. I know that PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in cmdlets for various malicious activities like file operations, network connections, etc. So seeing multiple ProcessAccess events from PowerShell could be suspicious. But sometimes legitimate admins also use PowerShell, so I need to check more.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe execution. That seems normal; maybe someone is checking their user permissions or something. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen, another cmd.exe command: it looks like they're trying to create a service with \"sc create win32times\" and then delete it with \"sc qc\". The script path mentioned is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1, which doesn't exist. That's odd because creating a service from a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code or persistence.\n\nLooking at services.exe and svchost.exe accessing the registry—those are system processes, but if they're writing to the registry without usual cause, it could indicate something fishy like installing a backdoor or altering system configurations.\n\nThere's also a sc.exe process creating \"win32times\" service. SC is used for managing services, so this might be part of the malicious script trying to create a persistent point to run arbitrary commands.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event modifying the registry—again, another red flag because cmd can execute scripts and change system settings which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nConhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is usually for console host processes; not sure why it's setting registry values here unless something is wrong. RuntimeBroker is related to UWP apps, so maybe unrelated unless there's a specific issue with that service.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems okay—it's likely part of log management software, but I should check if this process was initiated properly and not by an attacker.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events loading DLLs like amsi.dll (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) could be normal, especially if Chrome is running scripts. However, sometimes attackers might try to load malicious modules here, so it's worth noting, but on its own probably not too bad.\n\nPutting this together: There are multiple signs of script execution attempts using cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe, which often correlate with malicious activities. The attempt to create a non-existent script as a service is particularly concerning because that could be a persistence mechanism or an attempt to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications by various processes might indicate an attacker trying to hide their presence or alter system configurations for later access.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags indicating potential malicious behavior, such as script executions and service creation attempts from unknown scripts. However, I'm not 100% certain without more context, but the combination of events is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell access, registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe, creation of a service with non-existent script via cmd.exe, and an attempt to execute a potential malicious script. These indicate possible malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
