I'm trying to figure out if these events indicate any malicious activity or if they're just normal.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries involving processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe with command lines that delete tasks or processes. For example, one event shows cmd.exe deleting a task named 'win32times' using schtasks. Another entry has WMIC.exe trying to delete notepad.exe. These could be legitimate admin tasks, but they might also be signs of someone trying to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking at the registry activity, there are multiple entries where various processes like svchost.exe and conhost.exe are modifying registry values or objects. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers often tweak system settings to maintain persistence. However, some of these could also be normal operations by legitimate software.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe is run without any arguments. That seems harmless unless it's part of a larger sequence to gather user information.\n\nThe use of chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading amsi.dll might not be suspicious on their own, but the frequency and combination with other events could raise concerns.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: process creations for known tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used to delete tasks\/processes, multiple registry modifications, and some command-line activities that seem unusual. While none of these individually might be bad, their combination suggests possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations and deletions, including potentially malicious commands such as deleting tasks and processes using schtasks.exe and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few entries, I see processes like cmd.exe and chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because these are common system tools that might tweak settings. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run. That's a standard command to check user information, so it's not unusual. But then powershell.exe appears multiple times with various tasks like registry changes and image loads. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because of its powerful capabilities.\n\nI notice that several events show powershell.exe accessing processes (ProcessAccess rule) and setting registry values (RegistryEvent). These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with other behaviors, they might raise flags. For example, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading different images, which could be part of legitimate scripting or could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking further down, I see that a file was deleted by powershell.exe: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up after an attack, so this is more concerning. Also, the command line for some powershell.exe instances shows \"& {}\", which seems like a way to execute commands without outputting anything, possibly hiding activity.\n\nThere are also multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved in Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events, which might indicate it's being used in a loop or script that's running several times. Additionally, there are checks using Test-Path against specific paths, like \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\" and others, which don't seem to be standard PowerShell commands I'm familiar with.\n\nThe fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in multiple events, especially around file creation and deletion related to PowerShell profiles and temporary scripts, makes me think there's a pattern. The combination of registry manipulation, image loading, file deletions, and specific command-line arguments points towards potential malicious activity. \n\nMoreover, the use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe alongside powershell.exe could be part of an attack chain where initial access is gained using one tool, then another is used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events on their own aren't suspicious, the overall pattern suggests a possible breach. The repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands and file operations stands out as concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity, including registry modifications, image loading, and file deletions, alongside command-line anomalies suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from PowerShell, which is executing a command checking if a specific .bat file exists and then exiting with 0 or 1. That's unusual because it's a script checking for another script's presence. This could be part of legitimate scripting, but it might also indicate something malicious like checking if an exploit is present.\n\nNext, there are multiple events showing PowerShell loading various DLLs. These seem normal as PowerShell often loads these components when running scripts. However, the combination with the earlier command line makes me cautious. Malware often uses such checks to ensure it's on a system where certain tools or logs aren't present before executing malicious actions.\n\nThen, I notice that Chrome is making several registry changes. While Chrome does update its settings and extensions through registry writes, the number of events (four in total) might be worth looking into. Could there be an extension or plugin causing these changes? Or maybe something else manipulating Chrome's configuration.\n\nLooking further down, there are more PowerShell events. One creates a file related to the user profile's startup data, which is odd because scripts typically don't interact with user-specific profiles unless they have elevated permissions or specific intentions. Additionally, another event attempts to create a new .bat file in a directory structure that includes \"registro_geral\" and \"componente_geral\". Creating files in such structured directories might be an attempt to inject malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes with unusual command lines checking for specific files, creating new script files, and loading known DLLs. These behaviors could indicate a script trying to establish persistence or deploying additional malicious components. The use of batch files named with \"script.bat\" is a common tactic for executing commands in an environment that might bypass some security measures.\n\nThe repeated checks using Test-Path suggest the attacker wants to ensure certain files aren't present before proceeding, which is typical in malware to avoid detection or to confirm it's safe to proceed. The creation of new .bat files could be part of dropping additional payloads or creating persistence points.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming, the combination across multiple events raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes executing commands that check for and create script files, which could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that create or set content in various .bat files. The paths are a bit complex, but the fact that they're using Powershell to write batch scripts might be concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, most of them are related to Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which could indicate normal PowerShell operations. But I also notice some FileCreate events where specific files are being created in user directories. These files have names like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" and \"winlogbeat.yml.new\", which might be part of legitimate processes but could also be suspicious if they're appearing unexpectedly or in large numbers.\n\nThere's a process named conhost.exe accessing the registry, which is unusual because conhost is typically used for console applications. Registry access here might be an attempt to modify system configurations or hide activities.\n\nI see multiple instances where Powershell is checking if certain files exist using Test-Path and exiting based on that. This behavior could be part of a larger script trying to determine whether to proceed with malicious actions, like payload execution.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files suggests it might be an agent or log shipping tool, which in some cases can be used by attackers for persistence or logging purposes.\n\nOverall, while there are some legitimate-looking activities, the repeated use of Powershell with complex command lines and file operations across different directories raises red flags. The combination of script creation, file existence checks, and registry modifications could indicate potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances creating and accessing files, including suspicious command-line arguments and repeated file existence checks across various directories.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to analyzing logs, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they all seem related to process creations and file operations. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. For example, the first event shows PowerShell checking if a certain .exe exists. That seems a bit unusual because it's using a conditional check in the command line.\n\nI notice that some events involve creating temporary files, like the ones with paths ending in .ssp.ps1 and .fp2.ps1. Temporary script files created by PowerShell might be part of legitimate operations, but they could also be signs of malicious activity, especially if they're being used to test file existence or execute code.\n\nThere are also instances where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being run. Whoami is often used to get user information, which can be a sign of reconnaissance activities. The command line for cmd.exe has an IF EXIST statement checking for the existence of a specific text file. If it exists, it exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This kind of conditional execution in scripts or commands might indicate that something is trying to check if certain files are present, which could be part of a larger plan.\n\nAdditionally, there are several entries where PowerShell accesses the registry and loads .NET framework components. While these actions themselves aren't necessarily malicious, their combination with other activities (like file creation and external process calls) raises some flags.\n\nAnother point is that multiple events involve the same paths or structures in different directories, like C:\\modulo_secundario and C:\\registro_principal. This repetition might suggest a structured approach to checking files across various locations, which could be part of an attempt to ensure certain conditions are met before proceeding with another action.\n\nI'm also noticing that some processes don't have associated files but involve tasks like process creation or access. This makes me think about possible lateral movement techniques where malicious actors use legitimate tools (like PowerShell) to move within a network.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several red flags: repeated file checks across different directories, creation of temporary script files, usage of whoami and cmd for potential reconnaissance, and multiple registry accesses. These activities could indicate that an attacker is probing the system or preparing for further actions. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain if this is actual malicious behavior or just legitimate processes.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events seems too targeted and repetitive, which might not align with typical user activities. It could be an attacker testing system boundaries or deploying a payload.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: Interesting**\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several behaviors that merit attention due to their potential indicators of malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive File Checks**: Multiple events involve checking the existence of specific files across various directories, which may indicate reconnaissance or preparatory steps for further actions.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation**: PowerShell creates temporary script files (.ssp.ps1 and .fp2.ps1), which could be part of legitimate operations but also raise suspicion as they are often used in malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Use of whoami.exe and cmd.exe**: The execution of these utilities, especially with conditional checks (e.g., checking for specific files), suggests possible reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.\n\n4. **Registry Access and .NET Loading**: While not inherently malicious, these actions combined with other behaviors could signal an attacker using legitimate tools for nefarious purposes.\n\n5. **Structured File Path Usage**: The repetition of paths like C:\\modulo_secundario and C:\\registro_principal suggests a structured approach, possibly indicative of malicious probing.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of targeted file checks, temporary script creation, and the use of system utilities leans towards classifying this batch as \"Interesting,\" warranting further investigation to determine if it signals malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of PowerShell activities. That's already something to note because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious ones. The fact that it's being used multiple times in different ways might be significant.\n\nThe first event is about deleting a file using PowerShell. File deletion logged as an event. Then there are events where PowerShell creates pipes, which could be used for inter-process communication but sometimes also by malware to hide their activities or create backdoors.\n\nI notice several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist in specific directories. The command lines show commands like `Test-Path` being executed with different file paths. This repeated check might indicate that the script is trying to see if a malicious payload exists, or it could be part of some automated process. But since these are multiple and across various paths, it's a bit concerning.\n\nThere are events where registry values are set. Modifying the Windows Registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. If an attacker sets registry keys to ensure their script runs on startup, that would be a red flag. So seeing this multiple times adds more concern.\n\nAlso, I see several ImageLoad events from PowerShell. These are when it loads different DLLs. While legitimate scripts might do this, especially if they're using .NET frameworks, it's worth monitoring because some malicious scripts use these to load malicious components or bypass security measures.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. The filenames like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` seem suspicious. These could be part of script testing or they might be trying to create a persistence mechanism by placing malicious scripts there. The fact that both creation and deletion events are present makes me wonder what exactly was being done with those files.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run, which is often used to check the current user privileges. If this is part of a script, it could be testing if it has elevated rights, which might be a sign of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there are FileCreate events for creating `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the Downloads folder. This seems like part of setting up some logging tool, but without more context, I'm not sure if that's related to other activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions with varying commands, file deletions and creations in Temp, registry modifications, loading various DLLs, checking for files across different directories, and using whoami. All these actions, while individually could be legitimate, the volume and combination raise concerns about potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is using these events to establish persistence, gather information, or execute malicious scripts.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch of logs does warrant further investigation because the pattern of activities doesn't align with typical user behavior and may indicate a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a series of actions that collectively raise concerns about potential malicious activity. Here's a concise analysis:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activities**: Numerous PowerShell executions, including file deletions, pipe creations, and registry modifications. These could be legitimate or indicative of malicious intent.\n\n2. **File Operations**: Creation and deletion of temporary files in the Windows Temp directory with suspicious filenames. This behavior might suggest an attempt to create persistence mechanisms or hide malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Events where registry values are set, which can be a tactic for malware to ensure persistence across reboots.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**: Multiple ImageLoad events, potentially indicating the use of DLLs for malicious purposes or to bypass security measures.\n\n5. **User Privilege Check**: Execution of whoami.exe, possibly to test elevated privileges, a common step in lateral movement or escalation attempts.\n\n6. **File Path Checks**: Repeated checks using Test-Path across various directories, which could be part of a script testing for malicious payloads.\n\n7. **Log File Creation**: A FileCreate event for `.winlogbeat.yml.new`, likely related to log setup but contextually unclear in relation to other activities.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity, including persistence establishment and information gathering. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these actions and mitigate any risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The user is asking me to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually and see what they're showing. There are multiple entries here, so I need to spot any patterns or unusual activities.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that 'powershell.exe' is involved in several tasks. It's setting registry values, accessing processes, loading images, creating files, and deleting them. PowerShell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The fact that it's creating and then deleting a file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1' seems suspicious. That script name doesn't look standard, and the quick creation followed by deletion might indicate an attempt to hide traces.\n\nNext, there are entries where 'whoami.exe' is being executed with command lines pointing to system32. This could be normal for user info checks, but repeated use might not be typical unless it's part of some automated process.\n\n'Svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' also appear multiple times. Svchost is usually legitimate but can sometimes be used by malware. Chrome connections aren't unusual, but if there are too many network connections from the same process, that could raise a flag.\n\nThere's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in its own directory. That seems normal unless it's part of some log tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nI also notice that several events involve registry modifications and image loading. These can be signs of malicious activity because attackers often modify the registry to hide themselves or load malicious libraries.\n\nAnother point is the repeated command lines in powershell.exe: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse...}\". This looks like it's running a script that lists directories recursively, which could be part of data exfiltration or file enumeration. The fact that this command appears multiple times might indicate an attempt to gather information across the system.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: PowerShell creating and deleting files quickly, suspicious scripts being executed, repeated network connections from different processes, and registry modifications. These behaviors don't seem like normal user activity and could be indicative of malicious behavior such as script execution, file deletion to evade detection, and potential data collection or exfiltration.\n\nI'm also considering confidence levels. While some activities might have legitimate explanations, the combination of these events makes me lean towards a higher confidence that something suspicious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, file creation\/deletion patterns, and suspicious command-line arguments indicate possible malicious activity.
