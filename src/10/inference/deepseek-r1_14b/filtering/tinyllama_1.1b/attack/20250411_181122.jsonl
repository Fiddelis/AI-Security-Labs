{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where whoami.exe is run. That's usually just for checking user information, so not too concerning on its own. Then there are several entries about powershell.exe being accessed, which catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events, I see it's executing a script that uses findstr to search for the word \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. This seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to find sensitive information, which is a common tactic in malware or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe loads different image files and registry events. These could be part of normal operations, but combined with the command line activity, they might indicate that PowerShell is being used for more than just standard tasks.\n\nAnother event shows a file deletion attempt related to a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. Deleting files can be an attempt to cover tracks, which is a red flag for potential malicious behavior.\n\nThere's also a pipe created by powershell.exe, which could be used for communication between processes. This might be part of legitimate scripting but could also be a way for malware to hide its activities.\n\nI notice that several events are labeled as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" for PowerShell. These might be normal process events, but combined with the other suspicious actions, they add up.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome accessing the registry is common, the number of such events could indicate something unusual, especially when paired with the PowerShell activities.\n\nLastly, a file creation event in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder might be storing configuration or scripts, which could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nTaking all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines and attempts to delete files and create pipes suggest possible malicious activity. The combination points towards a script trying to gather sensitive information, possibly exfiltrating data or establishing persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to PowerShell executing potentially suspicious commands, including searching for 'pass' in various file types and deleting temporary files.

There are also several registry events from chrome.exe, which might be related to browser extensions or settings.\n\nHowever, the more concerning parts stand out. For instance, there's a process creation for whoami.exe without any suspicious command lines, which alone isn't alarming but could be part of user activity monitoring. The cmd.exe commands deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks are notable because they indicate someone is removing tasks from the system. This could be legitimate admin work or an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThe repeated calls to WMIC.exe with commands to delete processes named notepad.exe are especially suspicious. Using WMIC for process deletion can often be a sign of malicious activity, as attackers might use such techniques to terminate monitoring tools like Notepad, which some organizations use for logging or debugging purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the command line in one of the cmd.exe events is encoded with \">nul 2>&1\", which is a common tactic to suppress output and avoid detection. This kind of behavior raises red flags as it's often used by attackers to ensure their activities aren't logged visibly.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are many normal events, the presence of these specific commands and processes suggests potential malicious activity aimed at system manipulation and process termination. Therefore, this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains potentially suspicious activities such as deletion of scheduled tasks and attempts to terminate Notepad.exe using WMIC, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's a WMIC.exe process loading an image. That could be suspicious because WMIC is often used in attacks. Then, cmd.exe and powershell.exe show up multiple times with various commands. I notice several deletions of user accounts, which might indicate an attacker cleaning up traces. The use of net.exe and sc.exe to delete users and services is another red flag.\n\nThere are also a few whoami.exe executions, which could be used to check permissions or see if they're running as an admin. Powershell is being accessed several times, which is concerning because it's often weaponized for scripting attacks. The repeated calls to powershell with \"& {}\" in the command line seem unusual and might be part of malicious scripting.\n\nLooking at the tasks, many are Process Create, Registry value sets, and Image loads. These activities could be indicators of an attacker trying to maintain persistence or modify system configurations. The combination of these events—account deletions, service modifications, process creations, and image loading—raises concerns about potential unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that multiple different commands are used to delete users suggests a pattern rather than accidental behavior. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe with varied command lines might be part of an attack chain, possibly moving laterally within a network.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the activities seem coordinated and indicative of potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and registry modifications involving potentially malicious tools like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and whoami.exe. These activities include user account deletions and service removals, which may indicate unauthorized access or potential attack activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated accesses could be concerning. However, looking closer, these seem to be normal process accesses and image loads related to .NET framework components, which are standard operations.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is executed twice. While this tool can be used by attackers to gather information about the system, it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate purposes. Without additional context like unusual timing or other suspicious activities, I'm not sure if this stands out as malicious.\n\nAnother point is the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat.exe. This looks like part of the log shipping process and doesn't indicate anything nefarious on its own.\n\nI also see multiple registry value sets from various processes including RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. These are normal operations for many legitimate applications and don't raise any red flags without more context.\n\nThe chrome.exe events show DNS queries and network connections, which are typical behaviors for a browser and don't indicate malicious activity unless they point to known bad domains or IPs, which isn't the case here.\n\nTaking all these into account, while there are several activities that could potentially be monitored, none of them individually or collectively provide enough evidence to suggest malicious behavior. The events appear to be part of normal system operations and legitimate software usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system activities such as process creations, registry changes, and network\/dns queries from legitimate processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and notepad.exe.
