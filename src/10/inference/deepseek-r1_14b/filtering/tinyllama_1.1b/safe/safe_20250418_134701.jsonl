Every line starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":{\"path\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo, in each case, the process is git.exe, and it's creating a file. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\. Each path ends with different .d.ts files.\n\nHmm, I recognize that node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js applications. Cypress is a testing framework for web apps, and lodash is a popular JavaScript library. The \".d.ts\" extension stands for definition files, which are used for type-checking in TypeScript projects.\n\nGiven all this, it looks like git.exe is cloning or updating a repository, specifically the cypress\/types\/lodash package, which makes sense because developers often use these tools. Each event corresponds to the creation of a new file during the git processâ€”maybe a checkout, clone, or pull operation.\n\nSince each event is just the creation of these files by git.exe in a typical development environment, there's nothing unusual here. No signs of malicious activity like multiple failed logins, access to restricted areas, or unexpected processes. It's all standard file operations related to software development tools.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any reason to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation.

The filenames vary but they all end with \".d.ts\", which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files.

The fact that multiple files are being created in sequence suggests a bulk operation, possibly during an npm install or a build step where dependencies like Cypress and Lodash types are being fetched and their types declared.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unexpected processes, no access to sensitive areas outside the project directory, and all file paths seem legitimate for a development environment. The repetition of similar events with slight filename variations is typical in such contexts, especially when dealing with multiple type definitions.\n\nConsidering all this, it's likely just normal development activity using Git and related tools.

Each one is a JSON object representing some activity on a system. The key pieces of information in each event are the process name, the task from winlog, and the file path where something was created.\n\nFirst, all events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That's interesting because git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. It's not inherently malicious, but I need to consider if this usage aligns with expected behavior.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means the system detected a file being created. The files are all located under the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" and have various .d.ts extensions, like isFinite.d.ts, isFunction.d.ts, etc.\n\nLooking at these file names, they seem to be TypeScript declaration files for Lodash utility functions. Node modules are standard in JavaScript\/Node.js projects, especially when using frameworks like Cypress. The presence of multiple .d.ts files suggests that this is a typical setup where the system is installing or updating dependencies, possibly during a build process.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and involve creating files in a node_modules directory, which is common for development tools, I don't see any immediate red flags. There's no indication of unusual access times, file names that stand out as malicious, or other suspicious activities like attempts to execute these files immediately after creation.\n\nThe user involved is \"fiddelis\", who might be a developer working on the S206 - Qualidade de Software project. The fact that multiple related files are being created in quick succession by git.exe suggests this could be part of an npm install or yarn add operation, which would explain why many .d.ts files are being generated or updated.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any potential for abuse here. While it's possible for attackers to use legitimate tools like git for malicious purposes, the events themselves don't show signs of such misuse. There's no evidence of these files being executed elsewhere or any anomalies that would suggest they're part of a payload or exploit.\n\nIn summary, all the activities are consistent with normal software development processes involving version control and dependency management.

They all seem to follow the same structure, so I'll start by examining what each event represents.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that every event has \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control and file operations. The task in each winlog entry says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a new file was created, probably by the Git process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files within a directory structure under \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\". These are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which are part of the Cypress testing framework and related to lodash functions. The filenames vary, but they're all associated with Lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nNow, considering the context: Git creating multiple files in a node_modules directory suggests that this is happening during a development environment setup or an update. Developers often clone repositories, install dependencies, and run scripts which can trigger file creation events. This is entirely normal behavior when working with Node.js modules and testing frameworks like Cypress.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process name is legitimate (git.exe), the files being created are standard for a development setup, and there's no indication of unusual paths or access patterns. Each file creation event seems to be part of installing or updating dependencies, which is a common occurrence in software development.\n\nWhile it's always good to monitor such events, especially when dealing with system logs, there's nothing here that raises red flags. No elevated privileges are being used, no unexpected files are created outside the project directory, and the file types are as expected for TypeScript definitions.\n\nIn summary, this batch of events is part of normal development activities, specifically related to setting up or updating a software project's dependencies. There's no indication of unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or data exfiltration. Therefore, these events don't warrant further investigation from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, likely during normal development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that all these events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. The task is labeled as \"File created\", which falls under the FileCreate rule. Each event also specifies a file path ending with .d.ts, which seems to be TypeScript definition files.\n\nThe file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. Specifically, they're in the lodash fp directory. Lodash is a popular JavaScript library, and the 'fp' likely stands for 'functional programming', which makes sense as these would be type definitions for functional utilities.\n\nNow, considering that git.exe is being used to create files in a node_modules directory during development, this looks like normal activity when someone is working on a project using Git. Installing dependencies with npm or yarn might trigger the creation of these files as part of the build or setup process.\n\nThere's nothing unusual here; all events are consistent with standard development workflows. No signs of file deletion, access to sensitive areas, or unexpected processes. The same process name and similar file paths across multiple events reinforce that this is routine behavior related to software development.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs don't indicate any malicious activity.

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" I also need to provide a justification and a confidence score.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, all events have the same structure. Each event has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe.\" Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate.\" The \"file\" field shows the path to where the file was created.\n\nThe paths are all within a user directory on Windows: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software. Noticing that this seems to be a course folder, probably related to software quality or something similar. The files being created are in the \"node_modules\" directory, specifically under cypress and lodash's type definitions.\n\nWait, why is git.exe creating so many files? Git can create files when cloning repositories, updating, or performing other operations that involve checking out new versions of code. Node modules are typically managed by npm, which might be part of a development workflow.\n\nBut here's the thing: all these file creations are in a typical node_modules folder structure, which is where third-party libraries and their type definitions (d.ts files) are stored. This suggests that someone is working on a project using Cypress and Lodash, perhaps setting up a development environment or updating dependencies.\n\nThe fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created by git.exe might be a bit unusual because typically, these files would be part of npm packages. However, sometimes during Git operations like checks out branches or fetching updates, it's possible for the system to create new file references, especially if the repository is large or has many dependencies.\n\nBut another angle: could this indicate malicious activity? If an attacker wanted to create a lot of files quickly, they might abuse legitimate tools. However, git.exe creating these specific files in standard locations doesn't raise red flags immediately. It's more likely that someone is legitimately using Git and npm in their development environment.\n\nI should also consider the number of eventsâ€”there are 17 entries here, each for a different .d.ts file being created. That seems like a lot, but in the context of a developer working on a project with many dependencies, it's plausible.\n\nNow, could there be something suspicious? For instance, if the files were being deleted or accessed abnormally after creation, that might raise concerns. But here, they're just being created, and all within a standard directory structure for development tools.\n\nAnother point: the user's profile path and the course name suggest this is a student working on an assignment related to software quality. That aligns with typical file creation patterns during development.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs show legitimate activity from a user developing software using Git and npm packages. There are no signs of unauthorized access or malicious behavior. Therefore, while the number of events might seem high at first glance, they fit within normal operational activities for a developer environment.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not overreacting. Sometimes, even legitimate processes can generate a lot of log entries, but without additional context indicating something is wrong, it's best to classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The confidence score should reflect that I'm fairly certain there's no issue here.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** NOT INTERESTING  \n**Justification:** The logs indicate legitimate file creation activities by a user developing software using Git and npm packages. All files are within standard directories for development tools, showing normal operational behavior rather than signs of malicious activity.  \n\n**Confidence Score:** 95%"}

So, the user has given a batch of 18 JSONL events, each representing a file creation event by git.exe in specific paths under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash. I need to analyze all these together and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each event is showing. Each line indicates that the git.exe process created a file. The paths are all within a 'node_modules' directory, which suggests this is related to a Node.js project. Specifically, it's under cypress\/types\/lodash, so likely Cypress is being used as a testing framework here.\n\nLooking at the files created: they're .d.ts files, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are usually generated by tools like TypeScript or other libraries to provide type information for JavaScript modules. In this case, they seem to be various utility types from lodash, like isBuffer, isDate, etc. These are standard utility functions that check the type of variables.\n\nNow, considering git.exe creating these files: git can execute shell commands, and sometimes it's used in development scripts. But more commonly, when you run npm install or yarn install, the node_modules directory gets populated with various packages. The creation of multiple .d.ts files in a row by git.exe seems unusual because typically, npm install would handle that.\n\nI should check if there's any malicious activity associated with git.exe creating files in node_modules. I know that sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate tools like git for lateral movement or persistence, but in this case, the files being created are standard TypeScript declarations. There's no indication of anything suspicious like unexpected file names, encrypted content, or executable files.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if this is part of a larger pattern. If these events happened over a short period and followed other unusual activities, they might be concerning. However, as standalone events, each one just shows git.exe creating a legitimate-looking file in a project directory.\n\nI should also think about the frequency. Creating multiple files quickly could be normal during a build process or when dependencies are updated. Since all these are under cypress\/types\/lodash, it's possible that this is part of installing or updating the Cypress package and its type definitions.\n\nLooking for indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see any here.

No network connections or other actions that would raise a red flag.\n\nThe user mentioned to analyze the entire batch as a whole.
