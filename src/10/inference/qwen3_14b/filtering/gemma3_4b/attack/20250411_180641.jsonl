{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe with network connections. That's normal, as Chrome often connects to the internet. But then there's powershell.exe and process access events. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. \n\nThen, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but can be part of a larger attack. The next entries show powershell.exe again with process access and registry changes. Registry modifications can be a red flag if they're altering system settings or hiding processes.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that runs csc.exe (the C# compiler) with some temp files. That seems odd because compiling code in the temp directory might be part of an attack where malware is being compiled on the fly. The command line includes paths like C:\\modulo_secundario... which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious payload.\n\nThen, there are entries about file creation in the Temp directory, like pacote_logico.exe and unidade_padrao.exe. Executables in Temp folders are suspicious. Also, image load events for various DLLs from the .NET Framework. While some of these are legitimate, the combination with other events might indicate something malicious.\n\nThe process termination of elemento_ativo.exe could be part of a cleanup after an attack. There are also multiple registry value set events from different processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and notepad.exe. This might indicate attempts to modify system settings or evade detection.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe commands, compiling code in temp directories, creating executable files in Temp, and loading various DLLs could be signs of a malware infection or an attack in progress. Even though some processes are normal, the combination and the number of suspicious events make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell and cmd.exe executing obfuscated commands, compiling code in temporary directories, creating executable files in Temp folders, and loading potentially malicious DLLs. These patterns are commonly associated with malware execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event with calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so maybe normal. Then svchost.exe has several registry value set events. Svchost is a common host process, but multiple registry changes might be suspicious if they're modifying critical keys. But without knowing the specific registry paths, it's hard to say. \n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Usually, it's calc.exe. Maybe a typo or a renamed malicious file? Also, the same file path as before. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path seems like a default installation directory. However, multiple entries for chrome.exe with registry changes and image loads. Chrome usually doesn't load amsi.dll or MpOAV.dll unless there's some extension or malware. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. If chrome is loading those, maybe it's legitimate, but if it's being modified, that's a red flag. \n\nLooking at the process names: Calculator.exe is not standard. Also, the same file path for urlmon.dll is loaded by both calc.exe and Calculator.exe. Maybe a typo in the process name? Or could be a malicious process. Also, multiple registry events from chrome.exe. But chrome.exe is a common process, so unless there's something unusual in the registry changes, it might not be a big deal. \n\nThe winlogbeat events are about creating a file, which is normal during setup. The svchost.exe events with registry changes might be part of normal system operations, but if they're too frequent or on unusual keys, that's suspicious. However, the events don't specify the registry keys or the changes made. \n\nSo, the main points of interest are the non-standard process names (Calculator.exe instead of calc.exe), the same file loaded by different processes, and multiple registry changes. However, without more context on the registry keys or the nature of the changes, it's a bit hard. But the presence of multiple registry events and non-standard process names might indicate something worth investigating. \n\nI think the classification here is interesting because there are anomalies like the process name discrepancy and repeated registry events. The confidence is around 0.65 because some events could be normal, but others are suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe, combined with non-standard process names (Calculator.exe instead of calc.exe) and repeated loading of system DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll) may indicate suspicious activity or potential malware behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
