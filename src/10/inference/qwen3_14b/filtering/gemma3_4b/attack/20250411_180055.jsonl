{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. Multiple entries show 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. The command lines involve Compress-Archive commands, which are used to create zip files. That's a normal function, but when combined with other activities, it might be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are several 'Image loaded' events. The files loaded include .dlls from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading these might be normal, but if they're part of a larger pattern, it could indicate something. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be legitimate, but I need to check if there's any unusual behavior.\n\nThere's a 'File created' and then immediately a 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a file quickly might be part of a script execution, which isn't necessarily malicious, but could be if it's evading detection.\n\nThe repeated use of Compress-Archive with different paths and destination names in the TEMP directory might be part of a data exfiltration attempt. If the attacker is compressing files and then sending them out, that's a red flag. However, the events don't show any network activity, so I can't confirm that.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be used for inter-process communication. Again, this is normal, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering all these events, the main points are the multiple PowerShell activities, the use of Compress-Archive, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or move data. However, without network events or other signs of exploitation, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of legitimate .dlls loaded might be normal, but the frequency of PowerShell events is high. I'd say this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not a clear-cut malicious activity. So, the classification would be 'interesting' but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Repetitive use of `Compress-Archive`**: Multiple entries show PowerShell commands compressing directories into temporary ZIP files (e.g., `modulo_comum.zip`, `objeto_comum.zip`). While compression is normal, the **frequency and use of obfuscated paths** (e.g., `C:\\modulo_temporario\\...`) could indicate an attempt to **hide the source of data** or **exfiltrate files**.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file is **created and immediately deleted** (`$env:TEMP\\elemento_logico.zip`). This pattern is common in **malicious scripts** that execute in memory to avoid leaving traces on disk.\n\n3. **Image Loading**:\n   - Legitimate `.dll` files (e.g., from .NET Framework, Windows Defender) are loaded. While this is normal, the **lack of context** (e.g., no associated process or user activity) makes it harder to determine if this is benign or part of a larger attack.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which is normal in some scenarios but may be used by malware to **evade detection** or coordinate actions.\n\n### Indicators of Suspicion:\n- **Unusual Frequency**: The repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` and PowerShell suggests **automated or scripted behavior**, which may be malicious.\n- **Obfuscation**: Paths and filenames use non-standard, obfuscated terms (e.g., `modulo_temporario`, `objeto_base`), which could be an attempt to **mask the true intent** of the activity.\n- **Lack of Context**: No network events or user interactions are mentioned, making it harder to link these actions to a clear threat.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis activity is **not definitively malicious**, but the **combination of PowerShell compression, file manipulation, and obfuscation** raises enough suspicion to warrant **further investigation**. Check for:\n- Network traffic related to the compressed files.\n- User context (e.g., admin privileges, unusual login times).\n- Correlation with other logs (e.g., process creation, registry changes).\n\n**Classification**: **Interesting (Potential Indicator of Compromise)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a trusted component. The file path is in the ProgramData directory, which is common for system files. So maybe that's just normal activity.\n\nNext, there are several entries where powershell.exe is used with Compress-Archive. The command lines show that they're compressing directories into temporary files. The paths being compressed have names like \"componente_auxiliar\" and \"modulo_temporario,\" which are in Portuguese. That might be a red flag because attackers sometimes use non-English names to avoid detection. However, the use of Compress-Archive itself is a standard PowerShell cmdlet, so it's not inherently malicious. But the repetition of similar commands across different paths could indicate automated or scripted activity, maybe part of a larger process.\n\nLooking at the file paths in the Compress-Archive commands, they all point to bin directories under various folders. The use of $env:TEMP to save the zip files is normal, but if this is part of a data exfiltration attempt, that could be concerning. However, just compressing files isn't necessarily bad. \n\nThen there are entries about file creation by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is expected. The same file path is mentioned twice, which might be a duplicate entry, but not suspicious.\n\nRegistry events are logged for several processes, including powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding unauthorized entries, that's a problem. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed, so it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple registry events might be normal system behavior, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also an entry about svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe having registry value set events. These are common system processes, so their registry activity might be routine. However, if they're being used in an unusual way, that could be a sign of compromise.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell commands compressing files, some registry changes, and normal system processes. The key thing here is the repeated use of Compress-Archive with similar structures. If this is part of a larger attack, like preparing to exfiltrate data, that's a concern. But without seeing the destination of the compressed files or network activity, it's hard to confirm. \n\nAnother point is that the user might be looking for signs of malicious activity. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands could be a red flag, especially if they're not part of a known legitimate process. However, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's some suspicious activity with the repeated PowerShell commands and registry changes, without more context or evidence of malicious intent (like network connections to bad IPs, unusual file modifications, or known malware signatures), it's not conclusive. The logs might just be part of normal system operations or a benign script. However, the repetition and the use of non-English directory names could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Windows Defender\/URLMON.DLL**: \n   - Entries like `powershell.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` or `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files are consistent with legitimate system behavior (e.g., Windows Defender operations, log shipping tools).\n\n2. **Standard PowerShell Usage**:\n   - The use of `Compress-Archive` is a standard cmdlet for file compression. Temporary file creation via `$env:TEMP` is common in scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Compression Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` compressing directories (e.g., `componente_auxiliar`, `modulo_temporario`) into temporary ZIP files. While not inherently malicious, this repetition across non-English-named directories could indicate:\n     - **Automated data preparation** (e.g., for exfiltration).\n     - **Obfuscation** (use of non-English names to evade detection).\n\n2. **Unusual Registry Activity**:\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events for processes like `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `notepad.exe` (a common vector for malware) raise concerns. Without context on the specific registry keys modified, this could signal:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup keys).\n     - **Malware configuration** (e.g., injecting malicious code).\n\n3. **Multiple Process Access Events**:\n   - `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` and `calc.exe` (which is a benign process) could indicate:\n     - **Lateral movement** or **privilege escalation** if tied to unauthorized access.\n     - **False positives** if the system is under heavy monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators for Further Investigation**\n- **Non-English Directory Names**: The use of Portuguese terms (e.g., `componente_auxiliar`) may be an attempt to avoid detection.\n- **Lack of Context on Registry Changes**: The absence of specific registry key details (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\...`) limits immediate judgment but suggests a need for deeper analysis.\n- **Repetition of Commands**: The same `Compress-Archive` structure across multiple logs could indicate a scripted or automated process, which merits scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n- **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check if compressed files are being exfiltrated (e.g., via HTTP\/HTTPS requests to external IPs).\n- **Analyze Registry Changes**: Investigate modified registry keys for signs of persistence or malware.\n- **Check for PowerShell Script Signing**: Verify if scripts are signed by trusted entities.\n- **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior**: Look for unexpected process interactions (e.g., `calc.exe` accessing sensitive files).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **repetitive PowerShell commands**, **unusual registry events**, and **non-English directory names** suggest **potential benign or malicious behavior requiring further investigation**. This batch is **moderately suspicious** and should be prioritized for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them involve 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. The registry events alone might not be suspicious, but when combined with other actions, they could indicate something. \n\nLooking at the 'Image loaded' events, one of them is 'amsi.dll' from the Windows System32 directory. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll, that's normal. But another image loaded is 'MpOAV.dll' from the Windows Defender Platform. That's also a legitimate file. So those might be normal operations.\n\nThen there's an event with 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file could be part of its normal operation. But the file path has a '.new' extension, which might indicate it's a temporary or new configuration file. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext, there's 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but if it's being accessed in a way that's unusual, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, like the command line arguments or the source of the access, it's hard to tell. \n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a standard utility to display user information. The command line is straightforward, so that seems normal.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are from chrome.exe doing registry and image load tasks, which are common. The winlogbeat and powershell events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity. However, the repetition of registry value sets by chrome.exe could be part of normal operations, like updating settings. \n\nBut wait, if a legitimate process is modifying registry values multiple times, that might not be a problem. However, if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, like trying to disable security features, that would be concerning. But in this batch, there's no evidence of that. The image loaded events are for legitimate DLLs. The winlogbeat file creation is part of its normal setup. The PowerShell events are generic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. They might be part of normal system operations or benign activities. Therefore, the classification would be 'NOT INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.4. There's not enough evidence to warrant an investigation, but there are no obvious red flags either.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal operations (registry modifications, image loading, file creation). No clear indicators of malicious activity such as unexpected file paths, suspicious commands, or anomalous process interactions are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
