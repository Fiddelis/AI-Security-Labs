{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, which are system events. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the events. Most of them are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines in the process entries are using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks. The specific command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe as the executable. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a basic calculator and not typically used in legitimate tasks. Also, the tasks are set to trigger at logon, which might be normal, but the user group is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That's a red flag because running tasks with admin rights can be a sign of privilege escalation or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several entries about registry value sets and process accesses. Those could be normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's concerning. The ImageLoad events show that PowerShell is loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but when combined with the other activities, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nI also notice that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times with different task names (unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.). This repetition might be an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which could be part of a broader attack. The use of Register-ScheduledTask with different names could be trying to evade detection by varying the task names.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign explanations. For example, maybe an admin is testing scheduled tasks. But the fact that it's using calc.exe and setting high privileges is still suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple events with the same pattern increases the likelihood of malicious intent.\n\nThe confidence level: there are several indicators here, but not conclusive proof. However, the combination of creating multiple admin-level scheduled tasks with calc.exe, along with loading .NET assemblies, is strong enough to warrant investigation. So I'd say this is interesting and worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit **multiple suspicious patterns** indicative of potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Malicious Scheduled Task Creation**  \n   - **Repetitive PowerShell commands** are used to register **scheduled tasks** with the following characteristics:  \n     - **Executable**: `calc.exe` (a benign utility, often abused in attacks for obfuscation or as a payload placeholder).  \n     - **Trigger**: At logon (could be part of persistence mechanisms).  \n     - **Permissions**: `BUILTIN\\Administrators` with **RunLevel Highest** (escalated privileges, a red flag for privilege escalation or lateral movement).  \n     - **Task Names**: Varying names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `tarefa_geral`) suggest attempts to **evade detection** by obfuscating purpose.  \n\n2. **Abnormal .NET Assembly Loads**  \n   - PowerShell processes are loading **.NET assemblies** like:  \n     - `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`  \n     - These are typically associated with **managed code execution** (e.g., PowerShell scripts using .NET). While not inherently malicious, **combined with the other indicators**, this could signal **code injection** or **exploitation of .NET vulnerabilities**.\n\n3. **High-Volume Event Correlation**  \n   - **Repeated PowerShell activity** (12+ entries) with **registry modifications**, **process access**, and **image loads** suggests **system-wide manipulation** (e.g., modifying registry keys, injecting code into processes).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be used to **maintain access** to the system.  \n- **Privilege Escalation**: Use of `BUILTIN\\Administrators` with high privileges may indicate **exploitation of vulnerabilities** (e.g., misconfigured permissions).  \n- **Obfuscation**: Repeated task names and use of `calc.exe` may be **tactics to avoid detection** by security tools.  \n- **Code Execution**: The .NET assembly loads could be part of **malicious script execution** or **exploitation of .NET-based vulnerabilities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Source of PowerShell Scripts**  \n   - Check for unauthorized scripts in system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`, `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData`).  \n   - Analyze the PowerShell command history for signs of obfuscation or encoded payloads.  \n\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**  \n   - Verify the legitimacy of tasks named `unidade_ativo`, `tarefa_geral`, etc.  \n   - Check for unexpected triggers, executables, or user contexts.  \n\n3. **Inspect .NET Assembly Usage**  \n   - Monitor for unusual .NET activity (e.g., unexpected processes using `mscoree.dll` or `clr.dll`).  \n   - Check for signs of **reflection-based code execution** or **exploitation of .NET deserialization vulnerabilities**.  \n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**  \n   - Investigate if the attacker is using the compromised system to **access other systems** (e.g., via `chrome.exe` or network-related events not shown here).  \n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level**  \n**High** â€“ The combination of **escalated privileges**, **repetitive malicious task creation**, and **unusual .NET activity** strongly suggests **malicious intent**. However, further analysis (e.g., memory dumps, network traffic) is needed to confirm exploitation.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: This activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation by a security team."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory. That might be normal, but then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That's a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might indicate something malicious. Then, the command line shows PowerShell being used to create a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and set to run as Administrators with high privileges. That's definitely suspicious because using Scheduled Tasks to run calc.exe isn't normal, and the high privileges could be an attempt to escalate rights.\n\nThere are multiple events from chrome.exe related to registry changes. While Chrome might modify the registry, multiple changes could be part of a configuration change or possibly malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the PowerShell events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are several events with 'Execute a Remote Command' logged, but the process is listed as None. That's odd. If the system is logging remote command executions but can't identify the process, that might indicate a problem with the logging or a potential attack that's evading detection.\n\nThe PowerShell command lines show the use of ScheduledTask with high privileges and execution of calc.exe. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate tool, using it in this context with such permissions is likely malicious. The repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events without a process might be indicating that the system is being compromised through remote access, which is a serious issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating and deleting temp files, using PowerShell for high-privilege tasks, and multiple remote command executions without identifiable processes points towards a potential security incident. The confidence is high because these are common indicators of compromise in a Windows environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scheduled tasks with high privileges (run as Administrators), creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, and numerous unattributed 'Execute a Remote Command' events. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity attempting to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but loading a DLL from the System32 directory might be normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, and registry changes can be normal, but multiple entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Tasks directory called 'unidade_comum'. That path seems a bit odd. The name 'unidade_comum' is Portuguese for 'common unit', which might be a red flag if it's not a standard file. But maybe it's just a user-created file.\n\nThen there are entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' and the process is None. That's suspicious because if the process is not identified, it could mean the event is from a source that's not logged properly, or maybe a remote execution without a clear process. That might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, the file names here seem like they could be normal, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother entry is about chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But then there's a load of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That's also legitimate, so maybe just normal operations.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be unexpected. However, if the user is setting up Winlogbeat manually, that's possible.\n\nThere are multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. Chrome doing registry modifications isn't typical. That could be a sign of a compromise, like a browser being used as a vector for malware. But I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe might be normal, but if there's a lot of queries to suspicious domains, that's a problem. However, the log doesn't specify the domain, so I can't tell from this data.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious parts are the remote command executions with no process, the unusual file names in the Tasks directory, and the excessive registry changes by chrome.exe. However, some of these could be benign. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, 2) svchost.exe and chrome.exe performing unusual registry modifications, 3) creation of potentially malicious files in system directories (e.g., 'Tasks\\\\unidade_comum'), and 4) PowerShell creating files in user directories which could indicate script-based attacks. While some events may be benign, the combination suggests potential compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
