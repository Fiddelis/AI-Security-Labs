So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let me start by scanning through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Not sure yet. Powershell.exe being accessed might be normal, but sometimes it's used for malicious scripts. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines include running calc.exe. That seems odd because calc.exe is just the calculator, but creating scheduled tasks on logon and startup might be a red flag. Also, the tasks are set to run as system, which is a higher privilege. \n\nThen, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe creating files in the Tasks directory, like \"pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" and \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but creating scheduled tasks in system directories could be part of a persistence mechanism. \n\nAlso, schtasks.exe is being used multiple times to create these tasks. The command lines are similar, all pointing to running calc.exe. That might be a way to execute arbitrary code at startup or logon. \n\nAnother thing is the use of \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" in the task triggers. While calc.exe is a normal application, using it in this context might be a way to obfuscate malicious activities. Also, the names of the tasks have patterns with numbers and underscores, which might be part of a naming convention used by malware authors. \n\nAdditionally, multiple registry changes are being made by various processes, which could indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. \n\nPutting this all together, the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with unusual names, using cmd.exe to launch calc.exe, and the involvement of svchost.exe and schtasks.exe in creating these tasks might be signs of an attempt to establish persistence on the system. This is suspicious and could be part of a larger attack. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any legitimate reason for these tasks. For example, some legitimate software might create scheduled tasks, but the pattern here seems more automated or generated. The repetition of similar task names and the use of calc.exe as the trigger might be more indicative of malicious activity. \n\nSo, based on these observations, the batch is interesting because it shows multiple suspicious activities related to creating scheduled tasks with potentially malicious intent. The confidence is high because the combination of processes and actions points to a possible security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Malicious Activity\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created with suspicious names (e.g., 'modulo_principal_005_OnStartup') using 'cmd.exe \/c calc.exe' as the trigger. The use of 'schtasks.exe' combined with 'svchost.exe' creating files in system directories (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\...) indicates an attempt to establish persistence. The repetitive pattern of task creation with numeric suffixes and the use of 'calc.exe' (a benign utility) as a payload may be obfuscating malicious intent. Additionally, the involvement of 'conhost.exe' and excessive registry modifications further raises suspicion.\",\n  \"RISK_LEVEL\": \"High\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost and chrome, but others like powershell are often used in attacks. \n\nNow, the winlog events: most are Registry value set, which can be normal, but when combined with other events, might indicate something. There's also Process accessed and Pipe Created. The file events include a new .yml file created by winlogbeat, which is a log collector. That might be part of normal operations, but then there's a file created by powershell called unidade_ativo.txt. That's a text file, maybe storing data, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nWait, there's also Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files, but loading them might be part of normal operations. However, if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. \n\nThe whoami.exe process is running, which is a standard command to get user info. But the fact that it's being executed might be part of a larger script or attack. \n\nNow, looking at the frequency: chrome.exe has a lot of Registry value set events. That's a lot, but maybe it's just normal activity. However, if it's being used to modify registry keys in a way that's not typical, that could be a problem. \n\nAnother point is the use of powershell.exe multiple times. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The file creation by powershell might be part of data exfiltration or setup. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a pattern. The presence of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and file creations could indicate an attacker trying to modify system settings, access processes, or create files for persistence or data collection. \n\nHowever, some of these could be benign. For example, winlogbeat creating a config file is normal. The ImageLoad events are standard. But the high number of chrome.exe registry changes might be unusual. \n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The key points are the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, the use of powershell for file creation, and the presence of process access events. These might indicate an investigation is needed, but it's not a clear-cut attack. \n\nI think the confidence is moderate. Not high enough to be certain, but enough to warrant looking into it further. So classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the combination of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and file creations by potentially benign and malicious processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, process access events, and file creation by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity. While some events (e.g., winlogbeat file creation) may be benign, the combination of registry changes, process access, and file operations by chrome.exe and powershell.exe raises suspicion of attempted persistence or data manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
