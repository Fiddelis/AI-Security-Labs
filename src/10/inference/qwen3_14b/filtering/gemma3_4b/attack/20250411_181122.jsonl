The first entry is 'whoami.exe' being run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes.

This could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. The fact that a temporary script file is created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to avoid leaving evidence. The multiple PowerShell events and the command line searching for sensitive info are the key points here. However, without more context, like the user's normal behavior, it's a bit tricky.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look through each event to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry: powershell.exe loaded MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe normal. But then there's another event where powershell is running a command with findstr and select-string looking for passwords in files. That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in various file types could be part of a data extraction attempt.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events from svchost.exe and other processes. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're part of a larger pattern, maybe not. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, I think. But the repeated registry events from chrome.exe might be a red flag. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so maybe something's wrong there.\n\nAlso, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new config file might be part of a setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be an attack. However, the user might be installing it themselves.\n\nPutting it all together: the findstr command searching for passwords is a strong indicator of someone trying to find sensitive info. The multiple registry changes from chrome and other processes could be part of a broader malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But why is chrome.exe loading it? Maybe a false positive, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys that control system behavior. However, chrome might do some registry operations as part of its normal functioning, but repeated entries might indicate something else.\n\nNext, there are several network connections detected from chrome.exe. If it's connecting to known malicious IPs or unusual domains, that would be a red flag. But the data here doesn't specify the destination, so I can't tell yet. Still, multiple network connections could be part of exfiltrating data or communicating with a C2 server.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like writing configuration files or scripts, that could be concerning. The filenames here are generic, though.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup or updates. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is run, which just outputs the current user. That's a standard command, so probably benign.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack, but without knowing the original tasks, it's hard to say. The command line uses redirection to suppress output, which might be an attempt to hide activity.\n\nAnother cmd.exe process runs schtasks again, deleting more tasks. This seems like an attempt to remove scheduled tasks that might have been set up by an attacker. The use of \/f forces the deletion without confirmation, which is typical in automated scripts.\n\nThe schtasks.exe process is also involved in deleting tasks, which could be part of the same activity. However, schtasks is a legitimate tool, so it's not inherently malicious.\n\nLooking at the svchost.exe event, it's modifying the registry. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here might be normal, but again, the context matters.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes, network connections from chrome, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd and schtasks, and file creations. However, the key point is whether these activities are part of a larger attack. The deletion of scheduled tasks might indicate that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or prevent certain tasks from running. The repeated registry modifications and network activity could be signs of persistence or data exfiltration. But without more context like specific IPs, unusual commands, or unexpected file contents, it's a bit hard to confirm. However, the combination of these events does raise enough suspicion to warrant further investigation. The presence of multiple commands to delete scheduled tasks, especially with the \/f flag, is a red flag. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove their own tasks or prevent the system from running certain processes. Therefore, this batch of events is suspicious and would be worth looking into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### 1. **Unusual Process Behavior**\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll`** (part of Windows Defender): While legitimate, this could indicate a false positive or a potential hijacking of a trusted process.\n   - **Frequent registry modifications** by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`: Excessive registry changes may indicate attempts to alter system behavior or inject malicious configurations.\n\n### 2. **Network Activity**\n   - **Multiple `chrome.exe` network connections**: Without context on destination IPs\/domains, this could signal data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control (C2) server.\n\n### 3. **Scheduled Task Deletion**\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` deleting scheduled tasks** (e.g., `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `registro_base_005_OnStartup`): \n     - The use of `\/f` (force deletion) and redirection (`>nul 2>&1`) suggests an attempt to **remove evidence** or **disable defensive tasks**.\n     - This behavior is commonly associated with post-exploitation activities to **eliminate traces of an attack**.\n\n### 4. **Suspicious File Creation**\n   - **`powershell.exe` creating files** in the Downloads directory (e.g., `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`): While not inherently malicious, this could indicate the deployment of payloads or configuration files for persistence.\n\n### 5. **Process Injection or Hijacking**\n   - **`svchost.exe` modifying the registry**: This could signal attempts to **alter system services** or **inject malicious code** into legitimate processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **unusual registry activity**, **network connections from browser processes**, **scheduled task deletion**, and **file creation via PowerShell** raises **significant concerns** about potential **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration, or post-exploitation cleanup). These events are **worth investigating further** to confirm whether they are part of a legitimate process or an attack. \n\n**Recommendation**: Correlate these events with external threat intelligence (e.g., IP\/domain analysis), check for anomalous file contents, and inspect system logs for additional context."}

The first thing I notice is that there are several instances of processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe being used. Now, while these are common utilities, their usage here might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line where cmd.exe is used with wmic to delete processes, specifically notepad.exe. That seems odd because deleting a process isn't a typical user action. Also, there's a command to delete a user with net user \/del, which could be part of an attempt to remove an account, possibly to cover tracks.\n\nAnother point is the use of WMIC.exe loading DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If an attacker is trying to bypass or disable this, it could be a red flag. However, just loading these DLLs isn't necessarily malicious, but combined with other actions, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence or configuration changes. The repeated use of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent rules might suggest that there's some automated script or tool interacting with the system in ways that are not standard.\n\nAlso, the presence of whoami.exe being executed multiple times might be to check user context, which is common in initial reconnaissance phases. However, when combined with other suspicious commands, it could be part of a more complex attack.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern of privilege escalation or lateral movement. The deletion of users and processes might be part of that. However, without more context like IP addresses or user accounts involved, it's a bit hard to tell. But the combination of these events does raise some red flags, especially the use of WMIC to delete processes and modify the registry, along with the loading of certain DLLs.

PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". Oh, that's a command to delete a user account on a domain. That's unusual unless it's part of a planned maintenance. But deleting user accounts might be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack. Also, there's another command: \"sc delete win32times\" which deletes a service. Deleting services could be an attempt to remove malware or a legitimate service, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be malicious.\n\nThen there's 'net1.exe' which is not a standard Windows executable. The legitimate 'net.exe' is used for network commands, but 'net1.exe' could be a typo or a malicious binary. The command here is similar to the 'net user' command, trying to delete another user. That's suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' events. Modifying registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe 'User Account Management' and 'Security Group Management' events might indicate changes to user permissions or group memberships, which could be part of an attack to elevate privileges. However, these events alone aren't necessarily malicious.\n\nThe presence of 'conhost.exe' and 'services.exe' are normal processes, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they might be part of a larger attack chain. However, conhost.exe is typically associated with console windows and is legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: the deletion of user accounts via net and sc commands, the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe, multiple registry modifications, and repeated process accesses could indicate an attacker trying to manipulate user accounts, delete services, and modify the registry for persistence. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a cmd.exe process that's trying to delete files in the Temp directory. The command line shows it's deleting files named \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe\". That seems a bit odd. Why would someone delete these files? Maybe they're trying to clean up after some activity, which could be malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, Registry value set, and Image loaded. The Image loaded events point to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. Those are legitimate files, so that's normal. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1\". Creating and deleting a script file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe. These might be related to PowerShell's execution policies or some automated processes, but the repetition could indicate something unusual. Also, the use of \"cmd.exe\" with commands that delete temporary files might be part of a larger attack chain, like after downloading or executing a payload.\n\nThe presence of multiple Registry value set events could indicate attempts to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context on what registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the file deletions and PowerShell activities, it's a red flag.\n\nThe \"whoami.exe\" execution is normal, just checking the user. But the overall pattern of deleting files, creating temporary scripts, and multiple process accesses might suggest an attacker trying to maintain persistence or cover their tracks. The confidence here is medium because while there are suspicious activities, they could also be part of legitimate software operations. But the combination of these events increases the likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: cmd.exe attempting to delete temporary files with encoded names, PowerShell creating and immediately deleting a script file in the Temp directory, and repeated registry modifications.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a PowerShell process with a command line that has an empty curly brace. That might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. The winlog task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but maybe that's normal.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store files, so that's a potential issue. Then, there are several entries about registry value sets and process accesses. Multiple PowerShell processes accessing each other could indicate something is wrong, especially if they're trying to modify the registry or access other processes.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a normal command to check user context, but if it's done repeatedly, maybe it's part of a script trying to escalate privileges. Also, the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads folder might be part of a legitimate setup, but if that's unexpected, it could be a problem.\n\nHowever, there are also entries about 'calc.exe' and 'notepad.exe' loading images, which might be normal system activities. The 'svchost.exe' entries are common for Windows services, so they might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell activities, file creation in user directories, registry changes, and repeated process accesses. While some of these could be normal, the combination might indicate an attack, especially if the user isn't expecting these actions. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first one is powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info, but when combined with PowerShell, it might be part of something more. \n\nNext, another ProcessAccess for PowerShell. Then ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying the registry. Those are usually benign, but changing registry values could be part of persistence or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThen there are multiple DnsQuery events from chrome.exe. Chrome doing DNS lookups is normal, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains, that's a concern. However, the logs don't mention the domains. Also, multiple NetworkConnect events from Chrome. Again, normal for browsing, but maybe if they're connecting to suspicious IPs or ports, but again, no details here.\n\nLooking at the whole batch, the main suspicious elements are the repeated PowerShell accesses and the registry changes. However, none of the events indicate clear malicious activity. The presence of whoami.exe might be part of a legitimate script, and Chrome's network activity is typical. The registry changes by ApplicationFrameHost and Calculator are not obviously malicious. \n\nSo, the logs don't show a clear attack pattern. They might be part of normal user activity or benign processes. However, the repetition of PowerShell access could warrant further investigation. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, like unexpected commands, file access, or unusual network destinations, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. But I need to check if the combination of events is suspicious. \n\nWait, the first two events involve PowerShell and whoami. Maybe someone is running whoami via PowerShell, which is common in scripts. But without more context, it's hard to say. The rest are normal processes. So overall, the batch doesn't have enough indicators of compromise. Therefore, the classification is NOT INTERESTING with confidence around 0.4 to 0.5. The justification is that there's no clear malicious activity, just normal processes and typical events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of common system processes (powershell.exe, chrome.exe) and standard operations (DNS queries, registry modifications) without clear indicators of malicious activity or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.45\n}"}
