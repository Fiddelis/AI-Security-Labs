So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Then there's powershell.exe and calc.exe. Wait, calc.exe is usually a harmless calculator, but when combined with other actions, it might be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks. The command line has \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" which is odd because calc.exe is typically not run from the command line in this way. Also, the task names have some random strings like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" which might be obfuscated or part of a malicious payload. \n\nThen, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe and schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks. The file paths mentioned, like C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll, are legitimate, but the creation of tasks under \"Tasks\" directory might be suspicious if they weren't created by the user. Also, the use of the system account in the task creation (like \/ru system) could indicate that the attacker is trying to maintain persistence with elevated privileges.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry value changes by svchost.exe and other processes. While registry changes are normal, multiple changes from different processes might indicate tampering. \n\nThe fact that calc.exe is being loaded from urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer, might be a sign of something unusual. Also, the presence of multiple scheduled tasks created by schtasks.exe with commands that launch calc.exe could be a method to execute code at startup or logon, which is a common persistence technique.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with suspicious names, using system-level privileges, and launching calc.exe through command-line scripts seems like a potential indicator of compromise. Even though some processes are legitimate, the pattern here is more aligned with malicious activity trying to persist on the system. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon') using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, which is unusual for legitimate processes. 2) Repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes, which may indicate persistence mechanisms. 3) Unusual process combinations (e.g., powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events) and potential lateral movement indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing actions like creating a pipe, setting registry values, and loading image files. There's also some activity from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Let me break it down.\n\nStarting with chrome.exe: there are multiple entries of registry value sets. That's a lot. Normally, browsers might modify the registry for various reasons, like updating settings or extensions. But when there's a high volume of such events, it could indicate something malicious, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. However, I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be normal during setup or updates. But I should note that.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. Loading these DLLs could be normal, but sometimes attackers might try to bypass these by disabling them. However, in this case, the events just mention loading, not any tampering or disabling. So maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a file called 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. That seems like a regular file creation. But later, there are ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. Process access can be normal, but if it's being accessed in a way that's not typical, that might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother event is whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user information. It's common in legitimate scripts, but could also be part of reconnaissance by an attacker. However, alone, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are from chrome.exe with registry changes. While multiple registry modifications can be suspicious, chrome.exe is a legitimate process. However, if there's a pattern of modifying specific registry keys that are known for persistence or configuration changes, that's a concern. But the data here doesn't specify which registry keys are being modified, just that the value is set. So that's a bit vague.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat and powershell activities might be part of normal user behavior, like setting up monitoring tools or creating files. However, the high number of registry events from chrome.exe could indicate something more. Maybe the process is being used to inject code or modify settings for persistence. But without more details on the registry paths or the values being changed, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe confidence level here would be moderate. There's enough activity that's somewhat unusual (many registry changes from chrome) but not definitively malicious. The justification would be the high volume of registry modifications by chrome.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity, but more context is needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe, which is unusual for a standard browser. This could indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering. Additional events involving powershell.exe and file creation may suggest lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
