{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, browsers often do that. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe part of a larger attack. Next, powershell.exe and cmd.exe are involved. The cmd.exe entry has a command line with certutil -encode and -decode. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding files, but in this case, it's being used to encode calc.exe (a legitimate Windows app) into a temporary file. Then, decoding from a temp file to another executable. That seems odd. Why would someone encode and decode calc.exe? Maybe they're trying to obfuscate the file or exfiltrate data.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe being used with -encode and -decode. The command line in one entry is encoding calc.exe into a temp file, then decoding another temp file into an executable. This could be part of a data exfiltration attempt or trying to execute malicious code. Also, the presence of multiple registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration, possibly to persist the attack.\n\nAnother point is the File Executable Detected event for estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe. That file is in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dllâ€”those are system DLLs, but if they're being loaded by an unexpected process, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nChrome.exe has several network connection events. If it's connecting to multiple locations, that might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack. Also, the powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. While that's not inherently bad, if the file is malicious, that's a concern.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of certutil for encoding\/decoding, multiple registry changes, the presence of decoded executables in temp directories, and the combination of processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs. These activities could indicate an attacker trying to execute malicious code, exfiltrate data, or persist on the system. However, some of these actions could be legitimate, like encoding files for transfer, but the combination and the use of system tools in unusual ways raise red flags. The confidence is high enough to classify this as interesting, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential data exfiltration or obfuscation), SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (unusual behavior), and chrome.exe making repeated network connections (possible C2 communication). Combined with registry modifications and file creation in temp directories, this suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common scenario when someone is setting up a new tool, maybe for monitoring logs. But then there are three events related to powershell.exe. The second event mentions a registry value being set, which could be part of normal PowerShell usage, but sometimes malicious scripts use the registry to persist. The next two events are about process access, which might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes. \n\nNow, I need to check if this is suspicious. The presence of multiple PowerShell events could be normal, but combined with the file creation by winlogbeat, maybe there's something going on. However, winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, so creating its configuration file might be part of a setup. The registry change and process access could be part of a script that's just running normally. But I should consider if there's any unusual pattern. For example, if the registry change was to a known malicious key or if the process access is to sensitive processes. But from the given data, there's no specific details like that. The justification might be that there's no clear malicious activity, but the combination of events could be worth looking into. However, since there's no direct evidence of compromise, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit unsure. The confidence might be around 0.45 because there's some activity but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system activity: winlogbeat creating a configuration file and PowerShell performing registry operations and process access, which are common in legitimate workflows. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.45\n}"}
