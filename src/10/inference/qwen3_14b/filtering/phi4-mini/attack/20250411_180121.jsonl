Those are .NET Framework files, which are standard, so maybe not harmful. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple instances of chrome.exe with registry value set events. That alone might not be suspicious, as Chrome can modify the registry for various reasons. But then there's an entry with powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. Wait, that's a legitimate path, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a command line in a powershell.exe event that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting files, but the filename is LICENSE.txt. Hmm, that's a bit odd because LICENSE.txt is typically a text file, but the command is using WebClient.DownloadFile. Maybe that's just a normal download, but the path is $env:TEMP\\tarefa_ativo.txt. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a PowerShell startup profile, which could be normal, but maybe if it's being modified by an unauthorized process. Then, multiple registry value set events from powershell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe. A lot of registry changes might indicate some configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for cmd.exe: SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F. That's deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Maybe that's part of a cleanup after some activity. But why is that happening? If the task was created earlier, this might be a red flag.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution, which is a normal command to check user identity, so that's probably benign. The repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might indicate that another process is interacting with it, which could be normal or could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe file created by winlogbeat.exe is a .yml.new file in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe this is part of its normal operation, like configuration changes. But if it's being modified frequently, that might be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious thing is the PowerShell command downloading a file from GitHub. Even though the file is a LICENSE.txt, the fact that it's being downloaded to the temp directory and executed might be part of a larger script. Also, the deletion of the scheduled task \"spawn\" could be an attempt to remove evidence. However, there's not enough information to confirm if this is malicious. The other events are mostly normal system activities. So the classification might be INTERESTING with moderate confidence because of the download and task deletion, but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell downloading a file from GitHub (potential malicious script execution), deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn' (possible cleanup after lateral movement), and numerous registry modification events by PowerShell and system processes (potential configuration changes or persistence mechanisms).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each line.\n\nFirst event: schtasks.exe is deleting a task named \"spawn\" with the \/F flag. That's a bit suspicious because deleting a task might be part of a cleanup after executing something. But maybe it's a legitimate action if the task was malicious. However, just deleting a task alone might not be enough to flag it yet.\n\nNext, schtasks.exe again with image loaded, pointing to taskschd.dll. That's a normal system file, so probably not an issue.\n\nThen, cmd.exe and conhost.exe have registry value set events. Registry changes can be a red flag, especially if they're modifying startup entries or other critical keys. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is deleting a registry value in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's a common place for malware to hide, so deleting a value there might be an attempt to remove a persistence mechanism. But wait, the command line here is deleting \"modulo_temporario\" and another one deletes \"pacote_auxiliar\". If these are legitimate entries, maybe it's a cleanup. However, if the user is removing entries that shouldn't be there, that's suspicious.\n\nThere's a lot of powershell.exe events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The events include process access, registry value set, and image loaded. The image loaded events point to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem. However, in this case, the command lines don't show any obvious malicious scripts. There's a command line that's \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is just an empty block, so maybe a test or a benign command.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is run, which is just getting user info. That's normal. The reg.exe process is deleting registry keys in the Run section again. That's the same as before, so maybe the user is cleaning up after some installation or removal.\n\nThe repeated PowerShell events might be part of a script or automation. However, the combination of deleting registry entries in Run, using schtasks to delete a task, and multiple PowerShell processes could indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activities. But without more context, like unexpected network activity or file modifications, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these actions could be legitimate. For example, a user might be cleaning up old tasks or registry entries. But the fact that multiple registry deletions are happening, along with the use of schtasks and PowerShell, might be more indicative of an investigation-worthy scenario. Especially since the registry keys being modified are common places for persistence, so deleting them could be an attempt to remove malware's foothold.\n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The image loaded events for .NET DLLs are normal, but the repeated PowerShell processes might be a red flag. However, without seeing actual malicious commands or unexpected network traffic, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple registry deletions in the Run key is suspicious, though. That's a common technique used by malware to persist, so deleting them might be part of a cleanup after an attack. But again, it could be a legitimate action.\n\nOverall, the combination of registry modifications in sensitive areas and the use of tools like schtasks and PowerShell might warrant further investigation. The events are not overtly malicious on their own, but the pattern could be indicative of an attacker trying to remove traces.\n<\/think>\n\nThe sequence of events observed includes several actions that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) or suspicious behavior, even though no explicit malicious payloads are visible. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities**\n1. **Registry Modifications in `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`**\n   - **cmd.exe and reg.exe** are deleting registry keys named `modulo_temporario` and `pacote_auxiliar` in the **Run** registry key. This location is commonly exploited by malware for persistence (e.g., autorun entries). Deleting these keys could indicate:\n     - **Cleanup after a malicious payload** (e.g., removing persistence mechanisms).\n     - **Legitimate removal** of benign entries (e.g., software uninstallation), though this would typically be accompanied by user context or application logs.\n\n2. **`schtasks.exe` Task Deletion**\n   - A task named **\"spawn\"** is deleted using the `\/F` flag (force deletion). While this could be a legitimate cleanup, the name \"spawn\" is often used by malware to execute payloads. Deleting such a task might suggest an attempt to erase evidence of prior activity.\n\n3. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**\n   - Multiple **PowerShell.exe** processes are logged with **`ImageLoad`** events for .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, the repetition and lack of clear command-line arguments (e.g., `\"powershell.exe & {}\"`) could indicate:\n     - **Obfuscation or testing** of scripts.\n     - **Legitimate automation**, but the lack of contextual information (e.g., script content, user intent) raises concerns.\n\n4. **Absence of Clear Legitimate Context**\n   - No explicit user interaction, application logs, or network activity is mentioned. This absence of context makes it harder to distinguish between benign and malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Potential Concern**\n- **Persistence Removal**: Deleting registry keys in `Run` and a task named \"spawn\" suggests an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms, which is a common post-exploitation tactic.\n- **Unusual PowerShell Usage**: While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the lack of clear purpose (e.g., no script content in logs) and repeated activity could indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n- **No Clear Legitimate Purpose**: The actions lack obvious ties to user-initiated tasks or software uninstallation, which is unusual for benign activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., Security, System) for failed login attempts, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access.\n   - Review **Network Logs** for unexpected outbound traffic (e.g., to C2 servers) or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - If PowerShell scripts were executed, inspect their content for obfuscation, command-line arguments, or interaction with external resources (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`).\n\n3. **Check for File Modifications**:\n   - Look for changes to files in directories like `C:\\Windows\\Temp`, `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData`, or other common exploit paths.\n\n4. **Verify User Context**:\n   - Determine if the actions were performed by a privileged user (e.g., Administrator) or through compromised credentials.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the events alone do not confirm a security breach, the combination of **registry cleanup in persistence areas**, **task deletion**, and **unusual PowerShell activity** raises **moderate suspicion** of post-exploitation behavior. Further investigation is recommended to rule out malicious intent."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll go through each entry to see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about PowerShell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate operations. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag. Sometimes, attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. The file name has a PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be related to PowerShell scripts. But I need to see if there's more.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which might be empty commands or placeholders. Not sure yet. Also, there are multiple process accesses and registry changes. Registry modifications can be a sign of persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat file creation, which is a legitimate log shipping tool. So maybe some of these are just normal activities.\n\nBut the key points are the file creation and deletion in Temp, the multiple registry events, and the PowerShell activities. The combination of these might indicate someone trying to execute scripts, modify system settings, or establish persistence. However, without more context, like network activity or other indicators, it's hard to be certain. The presence of the Windows Defender DLL being loaded is normal, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nI should weigh these factors. The suspicious events are the file creation\/deletion, the registry changes, and multiple PowerShell activities. But since some of these could be benign, like script testing or legitimate log collection, the confidence might not be extremely high. However, the pattern of creating and deleting files, along with registry modifications, does raise some concerns. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell-related events include file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and process access attempts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious patterns or activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Let me check the specific events.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's an Image loaded event for clrjit.dll and MpOAV.dll. The clrjit.dll is part of the .NET Framework, which is normal, but MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender. However, the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell might be unusual. But I need to check more events.\n\nThen there's a File created event for a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be part of a legitimate test, but the fact that it's being created and then deleted (File Delete event) could be part of a script execution. However, creating and deleting a temporary file isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, there are several Pipe Created and Registry value set events. These could be part of normal operations, but when combined with PowerShell activities, they might indicate something more. Also, there's a Process accessed event, which might be normal but could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line entry for powershell.exe with \"& {}\", which is an empty script block. That might be a placeholder or a test. Then another entry shows a Process Create event with a command line that removes a file named objeto_principal.zip from the Temp directory. The removal of a zip file could be part of a cleanup after extracting something, which might be benign, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated Registry value set events for chrome.exe. However, Chrome is a common browser, and if it's being used for legitimate purposes, this might not be an issue. But if there are multiple registry changes, that could indicate some kind of configuration change or injection.\n\nThere's also an Image loaded event for mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. These are normal, but again, the context is important. If these are being loaded in an unusual way or by unexpected processes, that's a concern.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, the key points are the multiple PowerShell activities, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the registry changes. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or accessing sensitive files. The events seem to be part of normal operations, possibly testing or legitimate scripts.\n\nBut wait, the presence of a temporary zip file being removed could be part of an attack where the zip file contains malicious content. However, without seeing the contents of the zip or other related events, it's hard to say. The fact that the user is using PowerShell to remove it might be part of a larger attack chain, but on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. If that's being loaded by PowerShell, maybe there's some interaction with the antivirus, but I'm not sure. It could be a false positive or a legitimate check.\n\nIn summary, while there are several PowerShell-related events and some file operations, there's no clear evidence of a security threat. The activities could be part of normal system operations or testing. However, the high frequency of PowerShell events and the temporary file operations might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no hidden malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious PowerShell-related events. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity (High Frequency):**\n   - Multiple **PowerShell** processes are recorded, including:\n     - **File creation\/deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1`) is created and later deleted in the `Temp` directory. This could be part of a legitimate test or cleanup, but such behavior is often seen in malicious scripts.\n     - **File removal**: A command to delete `objeto_principal.zip` from the `Temp` directory suggests potential cleanup after extracting or processing a file. While benign on its own, this could hint at an attack chain if the zip file contained malicious content.\n     - **Registry modifications**: Repeated **Registry value set** events for PowerShell and Chrome processes might indicate attempts to modify system behavior or inject configurations.\n\n2. **Image Load Events:**\n   - **.NET Framework DLLs** (`clrjit.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded by PowerShell. These are legitimate components of the .NET runtime, but their loading via PowerShell could be unusual if not part of a known process.\n   - **Windows Defender DLL** (`MpOAV.dll`) is loaded by PowerShell. This might indicate interaction with the antivirus, but could also be a red flag if the process is unexpected.\n\n3. **Command-Line Activity:**\n   - A PowerShell command attempts to **remove a file** (`objeto_principal.zip`) using `Remove-Item`. This is a low-risk action unless tied to other malicious activities (e.g., extracting payloads, executing scripts).\n\n4. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No direct evidence of **malware execution**, **sensitive data access**, or **network communication** is present.\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` (a legitimate tool) and empty script blocks (`& {}`) suggests testing or benign operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Moderate Risk**: While the frequency of PowerShell events and temporary file operations is notable, there is **no definitive proof of malicious intent**. The activities could be:\n  - **Legitimate**: System testing, script execution, or cleanup.\n  - **Suspicious**: Potential indicators of an attack chain (e.g., temporary file usage for payload delivery or execution).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., downloads, connections) or **file system changes** involving `objeto_principal.zip`.\n   - Investigate **user context** (e.g., admin privileges, user accounts) to determine if the actions align with authorized workflows.\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** systems to flag unusual script execution or command patterns.\n\n3. **Review File Integrity**:\n   - Verify the integrity of files in the `Temp` directory and ensure they are not associated with known malware.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - If the system is part of a corporate network, confirm whether these activities are part of a **legitimate administrative task** or a **phishing\/social engineering attempt**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **no overtly malicious activity**, but the **high volume of PowerShell-related events** and **temporary file operations** warrant further investigation. These could be part of **normal operations**, but **additional context** is needed to rule out potential threats."}

There are several entries about images being loaded, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some other .dll files. Those are part of the .NET framework, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1, and then it's deleted.

The winlog tasks include Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. The files mentioned are mostly None, except for two entries where files are created: one related to winlogbeat and another called pacote_ativo.txt.\n\nNow, the key points here. The majority of events are from legitimate processes like chrome and RuntimeBroker, which are common. However, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is usually used to get user information, but when it's called repeatedly, that might be suspicious.
