{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and powershell.exe with network connections and process accesses. But those are common, so maybe not suspicious yet. Then I see a cmd.exe process that's running csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command line looks a bit odd with some paths and temporary files. That might be normal if someone is compiling code, but maybe not.\n\nNext, there's a csc.exe process creating an executable in the Temp folder. That's common for compiling, but the presence of multiple temp files and other processes like modulo_secundario.exe and componente_comum.exe loading .dll files from system directories might be suspicious. Wait, mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET runtime, so loading those is normal. But why so many different processes?\n\nLooking further, there's a 'unidade_logico.exe' running a temp file. That's a red flag. Also, the command line for the initial cmd.exe includes a path that seems to be compiling a .cs file into an executable. But the command line has some strange variables like %%TEMP%%, which might be a sign of obfuscation or trying to hide the path. \n\nThen there's the 'modulo_secundario.exe' loading mscoree.dll from System32, which is normal. However, the other processes like 'componente_comum.exe' loading mscoreei.dll from the .NET Framework directory is also standard. But the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for different .dlls might indicate that the process is part of a legitimate .NET application. However, the combination with the temp files and the csc.exe usage could be part of a malicious payload being compiled on the fly.\n\nAlso, there are several RegistryEvent entries for processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, which might be normal, but if they're all happening in a short time, it could be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably just a log file, not malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: the suspicious parts are the compilation of a .cs file into an executable in the Temp directory, the execution of a temp file named 'registro_temporario.exe', and the multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. However, these could be part of a legitimate application. But the fact that the code is being compiled in memory (using temp files) and the presence of multiple registry changes might indicate something more. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be compiling a legitimate application, but the way the command line is structured with variables and the use of temporary files could be a sign of obfuscation. I think the key points here are the compilation in temp directories and the execution of temp files. Since the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like connecting to C2 servers or injecting code, but the unusual process names and temp file usage might be enough to flag this as suspicious. So, I'd say this is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. While some activities may appear benign (e.g., standard .NET operations or legitimate tooling like `winlogbeat`), the following red flags suggest potential malicious behavior:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Compilation of Code in Temporary Directories**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process executes `csc.exe` (C# compiler) to compile a `.cs` file into an executable (`modulo_secundario.exe`) stored in the `%TEMP%` directory. This is **unusual** for standard user activity and could indicate **in-memory compilation** of malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   cmd.exe: \"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\csc.exe\" \/target:exe \/out:\"%TEMP%\\modulo_secundario.exe\" ...\n   ```\n\n   - **Risk**: Temporary directories are often used by malware to evade detection. The use of `%TEMP%` and obfuscated paths (`%%TEMP%%`) suggests an attempt to hide the true purpose of the compiled binary.\n\n2. **Execution of Suspicious Temporary Files**:\n   - A `unidade_logico.exe` process is launched from a temporary file (`%TEMP%\\registro_temporario.exe`). This file is not present in standard system directories and may be **malicious**.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   unidade_logico.exe: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\registro_temporario.exe\"\n   ```\n\n   - **Risk**: Executing files from temporary directories is a common tactic for malware to avoid leaving persistent traces.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Names and DLL Loads**:\n   - Processes like `modulo_secundario.exe`, `componente_comum.exe`, and `unidade_logico.exe` are not standard Windows processes. Their names (e.g., \"modulo_secundario\" in Portuguese) may be obfuscated or mimic legitimate software.\n   - Multiple `ImageLoad` events for `.dll` files (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are logged. While these are part of the .NET runtime, the **combination with non-standard processes** raises concerns.\n\n4. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `notepad.exe` are logged. While registry changes are normal, **frequent or unrelated modifications** could indicate **malware persistence mechanisms** or **tampering**.\n\n5. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**:\n   - No clear context (e.g., software development, scripting) is provided to justify the compilation of code in temporary directories or the execution of files named `registro_temporario.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants further investigation. The combination of:\n- **In-memory compilation** of code in temporary directories,\n- **Execution of files from volatile storage**,\n- **Unusual process names**, and\n- **Frequent registry modifications**,\n\nsuggests potential **malware activity**, **exploitation**, or **sophisticated evasion techniques**. \n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Analyze the compiled binaries (`modulo_secundario.exe`, `registro_temporario.exe`) for malicious behavior (e.g., YARA rules, sandboxing).\n- Check for **unauthorized software installations** or **persistently running processes**.\n- Monitor network traffic for **C2 communication** or **data exfiltration**.\n- Investigate the **origin of the `.cs` file** being compiled (e.g., file hashes, source directory).\n\n---\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** (likely malicious or highly suspicious)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. Most of the events are related to chrome.exe performing actions like creating a pipe and setting registry values. There are several entries where chrome.exe sets registry values multiple times. Then there's one event where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, so that might not be suspicious. \n\nBut wait, there's another event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. However, the file path has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. But is that suspicious? Maybe not on its own.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. Chrome.exe doing a lot of registry modifications and pipe creations could be a red flag. However, chrome.exe is a common application, and some of these actions might be part of normal operations. But multiple registry value sets in quick succession might indicate something like a configuration change or even a potential compromise. \n\nBut the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be part of normal operations if someone is setting up log shipping. However, the justification for being interesting would be if there's a pattern that suggests malicious activity. Since the majority of the events are from chrome.exe with registry changes and pipe creation, but no obvious malicious files or processes, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nHowever, the confidence isn't high enough to say it's definitely interesting. Maybe the system is just doing normal activities, and the events don't point to a clear threat. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior, even though there are multiple registry changes. The presence of legitimate processes and no obvious malicious files might make it not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate activities from chrome.exe (registry modifications, pipe creation) and winlogbeat.exe (file creation during configuration). No malicious indicators (e.g., suspicious files, unexpected process behavior) are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
