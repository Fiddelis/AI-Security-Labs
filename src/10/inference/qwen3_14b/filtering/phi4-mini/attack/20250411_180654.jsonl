{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. Specifically, there's a process creation event where PowerShell is running a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is designed to log keystrokes to a file in the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with malware or keyloggers.\n\nThen, there are several instances where the Registry value is set by Chrome.exe. While Chrome might legitimately modify the registry, the repetition of these events could indicate some automated or malicious activity. However, Chrome alone isn't necessarily suspicious here unless combined with other factors.\n\nAnother important point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest...). This could be part of a script execution attempt, possibly bypassing security policies. The fact that the file is created and then deleted might be an attempt to hide evidence of the activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell.exe loading various .dll files, some related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading these DLLs isn't inherently malicious, the context here—especially when combined with the keystroke logging script—raises concerns. The presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might indicate that the system's antivirus is involved, but it's also possible that the script is trying to interact with or evade the antivirus.\n\nThe repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths suggests a pattern. Even though the paths vary, the script's purpose remains the same: capturing keystrokes. This consistency points towards a potential malicious intent, possibly part of a broader attack strategy to steal sensitive information like passwords or other keystrokes.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of PowerShell executing keystroke logging scripts, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the multiple registry modifications could indicate a security threat. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack or data exfiltration. The confidence level is high enough to warrant further investigation but not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential keystroke logging via Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts, with temporary files created and deleted, suggesting possible malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: there's a PowerShell command that runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logging keystrokes to a temporary file. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware or keyloggers. The path mentioned is C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that it's using $env:TEMP to store the log file might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several entries about ImageLoad events for PowerShell and urlmon.dll. The one mentioning MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but the other one with urlmon.dll could be part of legitimate processes, but I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen, there's a FileCreated event for a PowerShell startup profile. That might be part of normal configuration, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something. The Registry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe might be part of normal operations, but again, depends on context.\n\nAnother event has a command line that's similar to the first one, again using Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The path here is different: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The repetition of the same script name in different directories might indicate that the attacker is trying to hide the script's location or is using multiple instances.\n\nThe next entry mentions a Remote Command execution with a file path that's in a common directory. That could be part of a legitimate process, but if it's unexpected, it's suspicious.\n\nThen there are several FileCreated events for winlogbeat and other files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. However, the presence of multiple file creations, especially if they're in unusual locations or times, could be part of an attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths suggests that someone is trying to capture keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these scripts and the associated file creation and registry changes points towards a potential security threat. The confidence is high because keystlogging is a strong indicator of malicious intent. However, there might be some false positives if these scripts are part of legitimate testing, but given the context, it's more likely to be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executed scripts named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with command-line arguments indicating keystroke logging to temporary files, a common technique in malware.
