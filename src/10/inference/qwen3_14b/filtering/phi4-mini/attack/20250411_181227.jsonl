So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, setting triggers on logon, and specifying the Administrators group with high run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges can be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. The fact that they're using PowerShell to do this is common in attacks, especially if they're bypassing security policies.\n\nThere are also several events related to registry value sets and process accesses. The image loaded events include some system DLLs, which might be normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll (from Windows Defender) could indicate that the script is interacting with antivirus components, maybe trying to disable or bypass them. However, that's just one possibility.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the Temp directory with a script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest... might be related to script execution. The name suggests it's a test script, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it could be part of an attack where the attacker is testing permissions or setting up persistence.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign explanations. For example, administrators might create scheduled tasks for legitimate purposes. But the repetition of the same command across multiple events, all targeting the Administrators group with high privileges, and the use of calc.exe (a common payload in tests or malicious scripts) points towards something suspicious. Also, the fact that the script is being created and then deleted might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe other events involving Chrome and pipe creation might be unrelated, but the focus here is on PowerShell and scheduled tasks. The combination of these factors makes me think this is likely a security incident, possibly an attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges on the system. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential security-related activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity**\n- **Scheduled Task Creation**:  \n  Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with the following characteristics:  \n  - **Execution of `calc.exe`** (often used as a test payload or indicator of malicious activity).  \n  - **Triggered on user logon** (suggesting persistence or post-exploitation behavior).  \n  - **Targeting the `Administrators` group with \"Highest Available\" privileges** (potentially for privilege escalation).  \n  - **Repetition of the same command across multiple events** (raises concerns about automation or scripted attacks).  \n\n  **Example**:  \n  ```powershell\n  $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n  $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n  $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n  Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n  ```\n\n  **Risk**: This could be an attempt to **establish persistence** or **escalate privileges** on the system.\n\n---\n\n### **2. File System Activity**\n- **Temporary Script File**:  \n  A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created in the user's temporary directory and then deleted.  \n  - **Purpose**: The filename suggests a test related to PowerShell script execution policies (e.g., bypassing restrictions).  \n  - **Tactics**: The creation and deletion of the file may indicate an attempt to **avoid leaving forensic evidence**.  \n\n- **Loaded DLLs**:  \n  PowerShell loads several system DLLs, including:  \n  - `mscoree.dll` (managed code execution).  \n  - `mscorlib.ni.dll` (part of the .NET runtime).  \n  - `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component).  \n  - **Implication**: The interaction with Windows Defender (`MpOAV.dll`) could indicate an attempt to **bypass antivirus\/EDR protections**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Process and Registry Events**\n- **Frequent Process Access\/Registry Modifications**:  \n  - Multiple entries log **process access** and **registry value changes** (e.g., `ProcessAccess`, `RegistryEvent`).  \n  - **Risk**: These events could signal **process injection**, **registry key tampering**, or **attempted disablement of security tools**.  \n\n- **Pipe Creation**:  \n  - Events involving `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` creating named pipes may indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, which is common in malware for **command-and-control (C2) communication** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Contextual Indicators**\n- **User Context**:  \n  The script is associated with the user **`fiddelis`**. If this is a non-administrative account, the activity could indicate **privilege escalation** or **exploitation of a vulnerability**.  \n- **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**:  \n  The repetitive nature of the scheduled task creation, combined with the deletion of a temporary script, lacks a clear benign explanation (e.g., routine maintenance tasks typically donâ€™t involve such patterns).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch contains **multiple red flags** consistent with **malicious activity**, including:  \n- **Scheduled task creation for persistence**.  \n- **Suspicious file operations** (script creation\/deletion).  \n- **Interaction with security tools** (Windows Defender).  \n- **Repetitive PowerShell commands** suggesting automation or evasion.  \n\n**Recommended Actions**:  \n1. **Investigate the user account \"fiddelis\"** for unauthorized access.  \n2. **Analyze the deleted script** (if possible via memory forensics or logs) for malicious content.  \n3. **Check Windows Defender logs** for signs of tampering or bypass attempts.  \n4. **Audit scheduled tasks** for unauthorized entries.  \n5. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user behavior) to confirm the threat scope.\n\nThis is a **high-priority incident** requiring immediate forensic analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's a PowerShell command creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe with the Administrators group and highest privileges. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to escalate privileges or execute malicious code.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes. While registry changes aren't inherently bad, the repetition might indicate something automated or malicious. However, the chrome.exe entries alone might not be suspicious without more context.\n\nThe next part has a lot of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks. That's concerning because it suggests someone is trying to run commands remotely, which is a common attack vector. But the process is listed as None, which might mean the logs are incomplete or the source isn't captured properly. Still, multiple entries here could indicate an ongoing attempt.\n\nAnother PowerShell command is creating a scheduled task named \"unidade_comum\" with similar parameters. This seems like a follow-up action, possibly trying to set up persistent access. The fact that it's creating a task with high privileges again is worrying.\n\nThere's also a file creation by svchost.exe in the Tasks directory, which aligns with the scheduled task creation. That's a good indicator that the task was successfully registered.\n\nThe other entries, like the WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll and chrome.exe loading amsi.dll, are normal system processes, but amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so that might be part of legitimate activity. The winlogbeat file creation seems unrelated unless there's a reason to suspect the tool is being misused.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of scheduled task creation with admin rights, multiple remote command executions, and the repetition of certain events suggest a potential security incident. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of these suspicious activities points towards an interesting case that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (e.g., 'Register-ScheduledTask estrutura_auxiliar$object' and 'Register-ScheduledTask unidade_comum$object') indicate potential privilege escalation. Combined with repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events and file creation in system directories, this suggests suspicious activity that warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the data. All the events are in JSONL format. Let me go through each line.\n\nThe first six entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. The winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Now, chrome.exe is a common browser, but modifying the registry could be suspicious. However, if it's just setting values, maybe it's part of normal operations. But doing it multiple times might be a red flag. However, without more context, like which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to tell. But since all six are the same, maybe it's a legitimate action repeated, or maybe part of an attack.\n\nThen the seventh entry is another chrome.exe event, but this time the task is \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\". Dns queries themselves are normal, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains involved, that could be suspicious. However, the entry doesn't specify the domain or any other details, so it's hard to say. Maybe just a regular query.\n\nThe eighth event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user-installed software. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during setup. That seems legitimate.\n\nThe ninth event is powershell.exe creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\" in the Downloads directory. Powershell is often used for administrative tasks, but creating a text file isn't necessarily malicious. However, the name is in Spanish, which might be a red herring. But without more context, like the content of the file or other actions, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from chrome.exe doing registry modifications and a DNS query. While repeated registry changes could be suspicious, they might be part of normal browser behavior. The other events involve file creation by winlogbeat and powershell, which could be normal. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events don't show any obvious signs of exploitation, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access. The justification for \"NOT INTERESTING\" would be that the activities observed are consistent with normal user and application behavior, without any clear anomalies that require further investigation. Confidence might be around 0.6, as there's some repetitive events but no clear malicious indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity (e.g., Chrome registry modifications, DNS queries, file creation by Winlogbeat and PowerShell) without clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
