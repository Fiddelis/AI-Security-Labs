{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are several processes related to network connections and DNS queries, like chrome.exe and MpDefenderCoreService.exe. But then there are some commands that stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe process that's adding a user called \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to a domain, and then adding that user to the Domain Admins group. That seems suspicious because creating domain admin accounts with such passwords is a red flag for potential unauthorized access or lateral movement.\n\nAnother event shows a cmd.exe running \"net user\" again with different usernames and passwords, which could be part of an attempt to create multiple admin accounts. Also, there's a process named \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a malicious variant of the net command. The use of \"net group\" to add users to the Domain Admins group is another concerning activity. \n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, but the path seems to be in a user's Downloads directory, which might be normal. However, the repeated file creation by svchost.exe for SRUtmp.log could be part of normal system operations, but combined with the other events, it might indicate something else. \n\nThe presence of whoami.exe and powershell.exe accessing processes could be part of reconnaissance. However, the main red flags here are the creation of domain admin accounts with temporary passwords and the use of net commands to modify group memberships. These activities are commonly associated with malicious activities like privilege escalation or setting up backdoors. \n\nI should check if these events are part of a legitimate administrative task. However, the use of such specific and potentially temporary passwords, along with adding users to Domain Admins, is highly unusual and likely malicious. The confidence level here would be high because these actions are indicative of a potential security breach.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts with temporary passwords (e.g., 'registro_temporario_pass123!'), use of 'net' commands to add users to Domain Admins group, and execution of 'net1.exe' (potential typo\/malicious variant). These indicate potential privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
