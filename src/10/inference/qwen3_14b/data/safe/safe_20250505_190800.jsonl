{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of the Elastic Beats, so maybe normal. But then there's mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE setting registry values. Registry changes can be normal too, but if they're from unexpected processes, that's a red flag. However, mmc.exe is a standard tool for managing consoles, and Explorer.EXE is the shell, so maybe not malicious here.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a concern. The first one is just Process Create with the standard path. Then several Image Load events for system DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET framework, so normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, which is then deleted. Creating and deleting a script file might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a test or temporary action. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which sounds like a legitimate test by the system or user. But the fact that it's created and then deleted could be an indicator of something trying to execute a script without leaving evidence.\n\nAnother event is a Pipe Created, which might be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger attack. Then, there's a Process Create event for powershell.exe with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". Bypassing the execution policy is a common tactic used by attackers to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked. The file \"teste.ps1\" is in the Downloads directory, which could be a user-initiated script, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the use of Bypass is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for winlogbeat.exe creating the same .winlogbeat.yml.new file. That might be part of the normal operation of winlogbeat, but if it's being created multiple times, maybe there's an issue. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity related to that process.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious parts are the PowerShell events, especially the execution policy bypass and the creation\/deletion of the temporary script. However, some of these could be legitimate, like a user running a test script. The presence of multiple PowerShell events and the bypass flag increases the suspicion. But without more context, like network activity or other malicious behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the combination of these factors makes this batch worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, particularly due to the use of **PowerShell with execution policy bypass** and **temporary script file creation\/deletion**. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n### 1. **PowerShell Execution with Bypass Policy**\n   - **Event**:  \n     ```\n     \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\n     ```\n   - **Risk**:  \n     Bypassing PowerShell's execution policy is a **common tactic** used by attackers to execute malicious scripts that would otherwise be blocked by default security policies. This suggests **potential malicious intent**, especially if the script (`teste.ps1`) is not explicitly authorized or documented.\n\n### 2. **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion**\n   - **Events**:  \n     - A script file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1` is **created** in the Temp directory.  \n     - The same file is subsequently **deleted**.  \n   - **Risk**:  \n     This pattern (create-and-delete) is often used to **avoid leaving evidence** of malicious activity. While the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" (which might imply a legitimate test), the lack of context (e.g., no user confirmation or logging) raises **red flags**.\n\n### 3. **Multiple PowerShell Activity**\n   - **Events**:  \n     - Multiple `Process Create` and `Image Load` events for `powershell.exe`, including loading system DLLs (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `MpClient.dll`).  \n   - **Risk**:  \n     While some activity is normal (e.g., legitimate script execution), the **frequency and context** (e.g., bypassing execution policies) could indicate **automated or malicious scripting**.\n\n### 4. **Registry Modifications**\n   - **Events**:  \n     - `Registry value set` by `powershell.exe` and `mmc.exe`.  \n   - **Risk**:  \n     Registry changes can be **legitimate** (e.g., configuration updates), but **unauthorized modifications** (especially by PowerShell) may indicate **tampering** or **malware persistence**.\n\n### 5. **Winlogbeat File Creation**\n   - **Events**:  \n     - Repeated `File created` events for `.winlogbeat.yml.new` by `winlogbeat.exe`.  \n   - **Context**:  \n     Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection. However, **redundant file creation** could indicate **configuration issues** or **unusual behavior** (e.g., logging tampering).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs exhibits **behavior consistent with potential malicious activity**, particularly the **PowerShell execution policy bypass** and **suspicious script handling**. While some events (e.g., Winlogbeat file creation) may be normal, the **combination of PowerShell anomalies and temporary script activity** warrants **further investigation**, including:\n- Checking the contents of `teste.ps1` (if accessible).\n- Reviewing network traffic or system changes during the time of the events.\n- Verifying user intent (e.g., was the script executed by an authorized user?).\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the PowerShell activity and script files to rule out malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe is accessing a process, which is logged under the ProcessAccess rule. Then, there are several ImageLoad events where PowerShell is loading various DLLs from the Windows System32 and .NET Framework directories. These are all legitimate system files, so that's normal. But then there's a FileCreate event where a temporary PowerShell script is created in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. That seems a bit suspicious because scripts in the Temp folder can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're created and then deleted quickly. \n\nLooking further, there's a FileDelete event for the same script. That might be part of a cleanup process, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. Then another FileCreate event for a StartupProfileData file. This could be related to PowerShell profiles, which are used for customizing the environment, but if it's being created in a non-interactive context, that might be unusual.\n\nThere's also a RegistryEvent where a registry value is set. That's not immediately suspicious on its own, but combined with other actions, it could indicate configuration changes. The last event is about executing a remote command, which is a red flag. However, the process field is null here, which might mean that the event is from a different source or there's incomplete data. \n\nPutting it all together: the creation and deletion of a temporary script in the Temp directory, along with loading of .NET DLLs and a remote command execution, could indicate that PowerShell is being used for some automated task or potentially malicious activity. The presence of the script and the remote command execution are the most concerning parts. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate processes, like script testing or system updates. But the combination of these events, especially the temporary script creation and deletion, might be indicative of something more sinister. \n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions are normal, but the pattern is enough to warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7. The justification is that the temporary script's creation and deletion, along with remote command execution, suggest potential malicious activity, though not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes load .NET Framework DLLs, create\/delete a temporary script file in the Temp directory, and attempt remote command execution.
