{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that might be okay. Notepad modifying the registry could be a red flag, but maybe it's just a legitimate action.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common admin tool. Then, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but loading it from calc.exe might be normal. However, looking further down, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks \/create with a trigger on logon and startup, running calc.exe. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with system-level permissions could be an attempt to persist.\n\nThen there's another schtasks.exe process creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same command. Also, svchost.exe is creating files in the Tasks directory. Svchost is a legitimate process, but creating files in System32\\Tasks might be part of setting up scheduled tasks, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n\nThe key points here are the multiple scheduled tasks being created with calc.exe as the trigger. Since calc.exe is a simple calculator, using it in this way might be a way to execute arbitrary commands. Also, the tasks are set to run on logon and startup, which is a common method for persistence. The presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes and the creation of task files in the system directory are indicators of potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any clear evidence of malicious intent. The tasks are using calc.exe, which is a legitimate executable, but combining it with schtasks to create persistent mechanisms could be suspicious. Additionally, the command lines have some obfuscation with quotes and slashes, which might be an attempt to hide the actual command.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch shows multiple suspicious activities related to creating scheduled tasks with potential for persistence, which is a common tactic in malware. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks with calc.exe as payload (potential persistence mechanism), 2) Unusual registry modifications by non-system processes, 3) PowerShell and cmd.exe activities that may indicate command-line based attacks, 4) svchost.exe creating files in system directories (unusual behavior). These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence and execution techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"High\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are from Chrome and PowerShell, with some from other processes like svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. The main activities are registry value sets, process accesses, and file creations. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the number of registry value set events from chrome.exe. That's a lot. Normally, Chrome might interact with the registry for its own operations, but an excessive number of such events could indicate something unusual. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nThen there's the file creation event by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be normal during configuration. But I should note that. Another file created by PowerShell is unidade_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but maybe it's just a regular file. However, if this file contains sensitive data, that could be an issue.\n\nThe process accessed events for PowerShell and chrome.exe might be normal, but if there's a pattern, like repeated access, that could be a red flag. Also, the presence of whoami.exe being executed could be benign, but if it's part of a larger attack chain, that's concerning.\n\nWait, there's also an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's antimalware scanning interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. If Chrome is loading these, maybe it's interacting with the security software, which could be normal, but again, if there's an unusual number of such events, it might be worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from legitimate processes, but the high frequency of registry changes from Chrome and the file creation by PowerShell might be worth investigating. However, without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's hard to say if this is malicious. The presence of whoami.exe is a red flag, but it's a common utility. \n\nI think the key points here are the repeated registry modifications and the file creation. However, since none of the events clearly indicate a breach or malicious activity (like downloading executables, network connections to suspicious IPs, or privilege escalation), the confidence level might be moderate. The classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" because there are a number of events that could be indicative of something unusual, but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation activities, suggest potential system manipulation. While some events may be benign, the volume and variety of actions warrant further investigation for possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
