{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing a DNS query, which is normal. Then powershell.exe is involved in registry changes and process creation. The command line for one of the powershell.exe processes is & {Get-Date}, which seems benignâ€”it's just getting the current date. But then there are multiple image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so maybe not a problem. However, there's also an image load for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so that's normal too.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. But then it's immediately deleted. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. However, the script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a test script, maybe part of a legitimate process. But why create and delete it so quickly? That's something to note.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but if they're repeated many times, it could indicate something unusual. However, the command line is still the same Get-Date command, which is harmless on its own.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file in the Downloads folder named \"estrutura_logico.txt\". If that's a normal file, it's not suspicious. But if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious content, that's a concern. However, the event only mentions file creation, not any malicious content being downloaded.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation, but if it's unexpected, it could be an issue. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: the most suspicious part is the temporary script file being created and deleted. That could be a sign of an attack, but it's also possible that it's a legitimate test. The repetition of certain events, like the Provider Lifecycle, might indicate something, but the commands themselves are benign. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs is normal. The other file creations don't have obvious malicious indicators.\n\nSo, while there are some potentially suspicious activities, like the temporary script, they might not be conclusive. It's possible that this is a false positive or part of a legitimate process. However, the fact that a script is created and deleted quickly could warrant further investigation. Therefore, the batch is somewhat interesting but not definitively malicious. The answer would be that it's moderately suspicious, requiring more analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **moderately suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`estrutura_logico.txt`) is created in the `Downloads` directory. While not inherently malicious, the **creation and immediate deletion** of a script file could indicate:\n     - **Obfuscation or cleanup** of a malicious payload.\n     - **Legitimate testing** (e.g., script execution testing), but the lack of context raises concerns.\n\n2. **Repetitive \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - Multiple events with these tasks (e.g., `Provider Lifecycle`, `Engine Lifecycle`) are logged, all referencing the `Get-Date` command. While harmless individually, **repetition** might suggest:\n     - **Automation or probing** (e.g., testing PowerShell behavior).\n     - **Malicious activity** using PowerShell for reconnaissance (though no direct evidence is present).\n\n3. **Legitimate System Activity**:\n   - **.NET Framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and **Windows Defender components** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`) are loaded. These are **normal system operations** and not suspicious.\n\n4. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**:\n   - A `.yml.new` configuration file is created by `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper tool). This is likely **legitimate** if part of a configuration update, but unexpected changes to log shippers could merit scrutiny.\n\n5. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involve `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While registry changes are common, the **absence of specific keys or values** makes it hard to assess intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion**:\n- **Script creation\/deletion**: May indicate **data exfiltration** or **malware execution**.\n- **Repetition of PowerShell events**: Could suggest **automation** or **exploitation** (though not confirmed).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check if the temporary script (`estrutura_logico.txt`) contains malicious content (e.g., via file analysis or memory dumps).\n   - Investigate the purpose of the repetitive PowerShell events (e.g., are they part of a legitimate workflow?).\n\n2. **Monitor for Follow-On Activity**:\n   - Look for **network traffic** from the affected host (e.g., DNS queries, outbound connections) that might indicate C2 communication.\n   - Check for **unauthorized modifications** to system files or registry keys.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Determine if the user account executing these actions has **elevated privileges** or **unusual access rights**.\n   - Verify if `winlogbeat.exe` is configured to create `.yml.new` files as part of its normal operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the **script creation\/deletion** and **repetitive PowerShell activity** are **low-level red flags**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out **malicious intent** or **unauthorized system manipulation**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first two entries are about PowerShell.exe triggering registry value set and process access events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. However, alone, these events might not be suspicious.\n\nThe third event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads folder might be part of its normal operation. However, the presence of a .new file extension could indicate that it's a temporary or newly created file, maybe during an installation or configuration process.\n\nCombining all three events, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The first two events involve PowerShell, which is normal, and the third is about a legitimate tool creating a file. Without additional context like unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files, these events don't form a pattern that suggests a security threat. Therefore, the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard system processes (powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe) performing typical operations (registry access, file creation) without indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
