{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's go through these events step by step. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. One event stands out: the 'cmd.exe' command line includes creating a scheduled task with 'schtasks \/create' that runs a PowerShell script. The script path is 'c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another instance is 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Both filenames have 'NonExistingScript' which might be a red flag. The use of '-ep bypass' in PowerShell is often used to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.\n\nAlso, there's a scheduled task named 'win32times' being created with the system account, which could be a sign of persistence. The fact that the task is set to run daily might indicate an attempt to maintain access. Additionally, the 'svchost.exe' process accessing the registry multiple times could be normal, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there are also benign activities like 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files, which is a log shipper, and 'chrome.exe' events which are common. The presence of 'whoami.exe' is standard for checking user context. \n\nBut the key points here are the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist (NonExistingScript), using bypass execution policy, and the repeated registry access. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination suggests an attempt to execute scripts and set up persistence. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate suspicious activity: scheduled task creation with PowerShell scripts using '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policies), repeated registry modifications by non-system processes, and creation of a scheduled task named 'win32times' with system-level privileges. These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
