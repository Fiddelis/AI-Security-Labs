{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines in the process entries are all using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks. Each command line is creating a new scheduled task action that executes calc.exe. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to the Administrators group with the highest run level. That seems suspicious because running calc.exe (which is a legitimate calculator app) at logon with admin privileges might be a way to execute arbitrary code under admin rights. \n\nWait, but why calc.exe? That's odd. Usually, attackers might use something more隐蔽, but using a legitimate executable like calc.exe could be a way to avoid detection. However, the fact that it's scheduled to run at logon for administrators might indicate that someone is trying to establish persistence on the system. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of the same command line with different task names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc.), which could be an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, increasing the chances of one being executed. The repetition might be part of a script that's trying to create multiple tasks, which is a common technique in malware to ensure persistence.\n\nThen, looking at the other events, there are entries about registry value sets and process accesses. The image load events show that PowerShell is loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it might indicate that the PowerShell process is part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nHowever, there are also entries for chrome.exe, which might be unrelated. But the majority of the events are focused on PowerShell and scheduled tasks. \n\nNow, considering the classification of these events: creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges, using PowerShell for this, and loading .NET assemblies. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate app, the context here is concerning. \n\nBut wait, could there be a benign explanation? Maybe a script that's being run as part of a legitimate process, but the way it's structured (multiple tasks, admin rights) is still suspicious. Without more context, like the user's environment or the source of the logs, it's hard to say for sure, but the patterns here are red flags.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, using PowerShell, and the loading of .NET assemblies are signs that this might be a security incident. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potentially malicious activity** and is **highly suspicious**, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Repeated Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands to create **scheduled tasks** that run `calc.exe` at logon, with **Administrator privileges**.\n   - Example command line:\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious**:\n     - `calc.exe` is a legitimate utility, but its use here is **unusual** in the context of scheduled tasks with elevated privileges.\n     - The repetition of task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`) suggests **multiple attempts** to create persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Privilege Escalation**:\n   - Tasks are configured to run under the **Administrators group** with **Highest run level**, indicating an attempt to **escalate privileges** or execute code with elevated rights.\n\n3. **PowerShell and .NET Assembly Loads**:\n   - PowerShell processes load .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`, which are **normal for PowerShell** but combined with the above activity, they may indicate **code injection** or **malicious scripting**.\n\n4. **Lack of Legitimate Context**:\n   - No clear justification for why `calc.exe` is being scheduled repeatedly, especially with administrative rights. This is **not typical behavior** in legitimate environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat**:\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The scheduled tasks could be part of a **malware campaign** to maintain access to the system.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Running tasks with **Administrator privileges** could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or bypass security controls.\n- **Obfuscation**: Using `calc.exe` (a benign executable) may be an attempt to **avoid detection** by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate the Source**:\n   - Check the **origin of the PowerShell processes** (e.g., user accounts, parent processes) to determine if they are legitimate.\n   - Look for **unusual user activity** (e.g., unauthorized access, lateral movement).\n\n2. **Analyze the Tasks**:\n   - Review the **scheduled tasks** created by the commands to confirm their behavior and ensure they are not malicious.\n\n3. **Check for Payloads**:\n   - Investigate if `calc.exe` is being used as a **dropper** for other malicious payloads (e.g., through process hollowing or injection).\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** or access to other systems, which could indicate post-exploitation activity.\n\n5. **Log Correlation**:\n   - Cross-reference these logs with **other security tools** (e.g., EDR, SIEM) to identify related events or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and likely represents **malicious activity**, such as an attempt to establish **persistence** or **escalate privileges**. Further investigation is **critical** to confirm the threat and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is involved, and the task is 'Image loaded' pointing to a file in the Windows Defender directory. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's files are part of the system. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script. The next event shows that same file being deleted. That could be normal, like a temporary script being used and then cleaned up. But the fact that it's created and deleted might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of regular operations.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be normal, but sometimes malicious scripts use pipes for communication. Then there's a command line from powershell.exe that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe with high privileges for administrators. That's a red flag. Creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. The command line uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets. The use of 'calc.exe' is a common example for testing, but in a real scenario, this could be a placeholder for a malicious payload.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe with registry value sets. Chrome might be updating its settings, but multiple registry changes could indicate some form of configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe 'Execute a Remote Command' events are logged multiple times with the process as None. That might indicate that the event source is unknown or the process was not identified, which could be a sign of something trying to execute commands remotely without proper attribution. However, if these are from a legitimate source, they might not be harmful. But repeated entries could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation with high privileges, are concerning. The creation and deletion of a temporary script might be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. The repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events, even if the process is unknown, add to the suspicion. However, some of these events might be false positives or part of normal system operations. The confidence here is medium because there are a few suspicious activities but not a clear-cut attack. The presence of both legitimate and potentially malicious activities makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious activity: creation of a temporary script file followed by its deletion, scheduled task registration with high-privilege execution for administrators, and repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with unknown process sources. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe something's wrong if it's loading unexpected files. However, taskschd.dll is part of Windows Task Scheduler, so that might be normal.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process, and registry changes can be normal, but repeated entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's a file created by svchost.exe at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the Tasks directory is usually for scheduled tasks. \"unidade_comum\" doesn't look like a standard name. Maybe a malicious task was created here?\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but could also be used for malicious purposes. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None executing a remote command. That's a red flag. If the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process, which could be a sign of something evading detection. But maybe it's a logging issue. However, two entries like that might be worth looking into.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in several ImageLoad events, loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files. So that seems normal. But there are many registry changes from chrome.exe, which is unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much. That could be a sign of something malicious, like a browser hijacker or malware modifying registry settings.\n\nAlso, there are multiple file creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating config files might be normal. But the presence of multiple file creations could be part of normal operations or could indicate data exfiltration if the files are sensitive.\n\nThe repeated registry events from chrome.exe and the remote command executions without a process might be the most suspicious. However, I need to check if these are part of normal operations. For example, if the user is running a script that modifies the registry, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, the combination of unusual registry modifications by chrome.exe, the remote command executions without a process, and the creation of a file in the Tasks directory might indicate a potential security issue. However, some of these could be false positives. The confidence is moderate, so I'd say \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'svchost.exe' creating a file in the Windows Tasks directory (unusual for this process), 2) 'chrome.exe' performing numerous registry modifications (uncharacteristic behavior), 3) events with 'process: None' executing remote commands (potential evasion technique), and 4) PowerShell creating files in user directories which could indicate script-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
