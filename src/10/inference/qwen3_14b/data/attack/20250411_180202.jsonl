{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch to see if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess rule. Then whoami.exe is created, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe activities again. Then a registry value set by powershell, which could be suspicious. \n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to create notepad.exe. That seems odd because wmic is often used in attacks. Then, WMIC.exe is loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If an attacker is trying to bypass it, that's a red flag. Also, the paths for the DLLs include Windows Defender's directory, which might indicate an attempt to compromise or disable the defender.\n\nThen, wmiprvse.exe is modifying the registry, which could be part of setting up persistence or changing system settings. The creation of a file named objeto_temporario.txt by powershell might be hiding malicious data. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file could be related to configuration changes, maybe for data exfiltration or logging.\n\nThere are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent rules, which are often triggered by malicious activities. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious commands, along with loading DLLs associated with security software, points towards potential malware or an attack trying to evade detection. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of these events suggests that there might be an ongoing attack, possibly trying to disable security features and execute malicious code. The confidence is high because of the multiple suspicious activities and the involvement of security-related DLLs.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated powershell.exe and WMIC.exe usage, loading of security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, urlmon.dll), registry modifications, and creation of temporary files. These patterns are commonly associated with malware execution and evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
