{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see some PowerShell.exe processes with ProcessAccess events. That's common, but not necessarily bad.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe create and start commands. The command line looks like it's trying to create a service called \"elemento_principal\" with a path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory. That's suspicious because creating services in unusual locations can be a sign of malicious activity. The same cmd.exe is also starting another service, \"modulo_comum\". \n\nThen there are multiple entries of sc.exe creating services with paths like \"C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar\\\\registro_base\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\bin\\\\unidade_geral.exe\". These paths don't look standard. Typically, legitimate services are installed in system directories like C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows\\System32. The presence of \"pacote_auxiliar\" and \"modulo_comum\" suggests possibly obfuscated or custom-named files, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate .NET components, the fact that they're being loaded by various processes might be normal, but combined with the service creation, it could indicate something is wrong. However, the main concern here is the service creation and the non-standard paths.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value set events involving services.exe and cmd.exe. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate processes, but when combined with service creation and non-standard paths, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe presence of multiple sc.exe commands to create and start services in non-standard locations, along with the use of cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe for these actions, is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. This could be an attempt to install a backdoor or persistent malware on the system.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows suspicious activity with service creation in unusual directories and the use of command-line tools to modify system services. This is likely worth investigating further. The confidence level is high because these are common indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual service creation via sc.exe with non-standard paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_comum.exe'). 2) cmd.exe executing service creation commands in obfuscated directory structures. 3) Frequent registry modification events by services.exe and cmd.exe. These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there are several entries about powershell.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, and others performing registry value sets and process accesses. \n\nWait, the file paths for the created files are in the user's Downloads folder. That's a common place for legitimate downloads, but sometimes malware is also placed there. However, the other events involve processes like powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Powershell is often used by attackers for malicious activities, but it's also a standard tool. The registry events could be part of normal operations or might indicate changes to system settings. \n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events for calc.exe and Calculator.exe, both are loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file. However, if an unexpected process is loading dlls from unusual locations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the paths are standard. \n\nI notice that winlogbeat.exe is creating the same file twice. Maybe it's a configuration file being written, which is normal for that tool. The other processes like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are system processes, so their activities might be normal. However, multiple registry value sets could be a sign of something trying to modify system settings, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe justification needs to be concise. If there's no clear malicious activity, like unexpected file creation in sensitive areas, or suspicious process behavior, then it might not be interesting. But if there's a pattern that's unusual, like multiple registry changes or unauthorized file creation, that could be interesting. \n\nIn this case, the events seem to be a mix of normal system activities and legitimate processes. The file creation by winlogbeat is probably part of its setup. The registry events might be from normal operations. There's no clear evidence of a security incident here. So, the classification is likely NOT INTERESTING, with low confidence because without more context, it's hard to be certain, but the activities don't point to obvious threats.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations and legitimate process activities (e.g., file creation by winlogbeat.exe during setup, standard registry access by system processes). No suspicious patterns or security-relevant anomalies are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
