{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the logs. There are multiple entries for powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are common but can be indicators of malicious activity if used in suspicious ways. The 'Process Create' events for sc.exe stand out because sc.exe is used to manage Windows services. The command lines here involve creating a service with a binPath that starts a PowerShell script. The filenames mentioned, like 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1', have \"NonExistingScript\" in them, which might be a red flag. That could be a typo or a way to hide the script's true name, but it's unusual.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Registry value set' events involving services.exe and svchost.exe. While registry changes are normal, multiple changes in a short period could indicate tampering. Also, the 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll are normal, but if there's a lot of them or from unexpected processes, that might be a concern. However, in this case, it's just a couple of instances.\n\nThe 'File created' event for winlogbeat.exe is about a configuration file, which seems legitimate. But the other events involving creating services and registry changes might be part of an attempt to persist or hide malicious activity. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating services with suspicious scripts, multiple registry changes, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe in ways that could be part of an attack chain makes this batch interesting. The confidence is around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination and specific commands suggest potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated process creation for PowerShell\/cmd.exe with registry modifications, attempts to create Windows services with suspicious scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), and unusual registry value changes by services.exe\/svchost.exe which may indicate persistence mechanisms or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are a bunch of entries here. The first eight lines all show chrome.exe performing a \"Registry value set\" task under the RegistryEvent rule. Then there are two entries where chrome.exe loads images, specifically amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. The last entry is about powershell.exe being accessed via ProcessAccess.\n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that chrome.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. But is that unusual? Well, Chrome might do some registry operations for its own purposes, like settings or extensions. But doing it repeatedly could be a red flag. However, the first eight entries are all the same: same process, same task, same file (None). Maybe that's normal behavior, but maybe not. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's the image loading part. The two entries where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Now, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. But why would chrome.exe be loading these files? Typically, those DLLs are loaded by the system or other security processes. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading them, maybe it's not a problem. But sometimes, malware might mimic legitimate processes. However, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. The paths look legitimate, though.\n\nThe last entry is about powershell.exe being accessed. ProcessAccess events can indicate that another process has accessed or interacted with PowerShell. This could be normal, like a user running a script, but it could also be part of a malicious activity. However, there's no other information here, like the source process or any other details that would indicate malicious intent.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe might be normal, but the same process loading security-related DLLs could be suspicious. However, without more context, such as unusual parameters, unexpected parent processes, or other anomalous behavior, it's hard to confirm. The presence of ProcessAccess for PowerShell alone isn't enough to flag it as malicious.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking whether the batch is interesting. The key here is that all the events are related to Chrome and some normal system processes. There's no clear indication of a security incident. The same process doing the same actions repeatedly might be normal. However, if there's a sudden increase in such events or if they're part of a larger pattern, that's different. But with the given data, I don't see a clear threat. So maybe it's not interesting. But I should check if any of these events are known indicators of compromise. For example, if Chrome was modifying registry keys related to security settings or if the image loading is from unexpected paths. But the paths here are standard. So I think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there's some unusual activity, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and legitimate image loads (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) associated with Windows Defender. No clear malicious behavior or anomalous patterns are evident in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
