{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs indicate several suspicious activities, primarily revolving around the creation and management of a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Here's a breakdown and potential concerns:\n\n**1.  Service Creation with PowerShell:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}`**\n    *   This is the most significant finding.  It attempts to:\n        *   Create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".\n        *   Set the binary path to `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This path is unusual and highly suspect.  The file names \"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", \"entrada_base\" and \"tarefa_logico.exe\" are not standard and suggest an attempt to obscure the true purpose of the file.\n        *   Immediately starts the newly created service.\n    *   **Risk:**  This is a HUGE red flag.  Creating a service through PowerShell is a common tactic for malware to persist across reboots and execute malicious code with elevated privileges. The path to `tarefa_logico.exe` is highly suspicious. It's critical to determine the origin and purpose of this file.\n\n**2.  PowerShell Execution Bypass (Restricted Policy):**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`**\n    *   The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` with a subsequent command indicates an attempt to circumvent PowerShell's built-in security measures.  The `Restricted` policy is the most restrictive, preventing unsigned scripts from running.  The attacker is trying to run a command despite this restriction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n    *   **Risk:**  This demonstrates an attacker's ability to bypass security controls.\n\n**3. Repeated Actions:**\n\n*   The creation of \"objeto_ativo\" service is repeated numerous times, along with the restricted PowerShell commands. This suggests either:\n    *   A persistent script is continuously attempting to recreate the service (in case it was deleted).\n    *   Multiple instances of the script are running.\n    *   The attacker is trying to ensure the service is running and the security bypass is consistently functional.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\nThis system is likely compromised or is being actively targeted by an attacker.  The creation of a custom service and attempts to circumvent PowerShell's execution policy are strong indicators of malicious activity.\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network immediately to prevent further spread of potential malware.\n2.  **Investigate `tarefa_logico.exe`:**  This is the top priority.  Analyze this file with a reputable antivirus scanner (online scanning services are okay if isolation is complete).  Look for strings, PE headers, and disassembly.  Research where this file came from (last modified date, origin, etc.).\n3.  **Examine Scheduled Tasks and Startup Items:**  Check for any suspicious scheduled tasks or startup items that might be running the PowerShell scripts or creating the service.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Ensure that PowerShell execution policies are appropriately configured and monitored.\n5.  **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**  Search for other methods of persistence beyond the scheduled task and service creation.  Look at registry keys, startup folders, and other common locations.\n6.  **Full System Scan:**  Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n7.  **Forensic Analysis:** If the system is critical, consider a full forensic analysis by a cybersecurity professional to determine the extent of the compromise.\n8.  **Rebuild (Best Practice):** The most secure approach is often to completely rebuild the affected system from a known-good backup or clean install.\n\n**Important Note:**  Do not delete anything until the system has been properly investigated. Deletion can make forensic analysis more difficult.  Consult with a cybersecurity professional if you are unsure about any of these steps."}
