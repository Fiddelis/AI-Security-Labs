The repeated use of 'sc.exe' to create and start services, coupled with the unusual executable names and command-line arguments, suggests potential malicious activity, possibly involving persistence mechanisms or unauthorized service installations. The use of .NET runtime DLLs loaded by multiple executables further hints at a potentially sophisticated attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
