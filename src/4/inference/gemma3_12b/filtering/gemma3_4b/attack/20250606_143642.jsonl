{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this PowerShell activity log. This looks like a malicious script attempting to execute, evade detection, and clean up after itself.\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe script starts by creating a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) and immediately deleting it. This is a common technique to bypass some antivirus solutions that rely on file presence on disk to identify malicious content. The script then attempts to remove other files. There's evidence of DLL loading suggestive of attempting to perform some sort of operation related to powershell script execution, and system interaction.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Events**\n\n1.  **Process Creation & Registry Changes:**\n    *   `powershell.exe` processes are created and registry changes are made.  This establishes the environment for the malicious script.\n\n2.  **File Deletion Attempt:**\n    *   `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`: The script attempts to delete a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory.  The `-Force` parameter suppresses confirmation prompts, indicating an attempt to delete files silently.  This file likely contained the initial payload or other components of the attack.\n\n3.  **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion:**\n    *   `powershell.exe` creates a script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` and then immediately deletes it. The `PSScriptPolicyTest` is a deliberate attempt to exploit a PowerShell feature. In older PowerShell versions, this could temporarily lower the execution policy, allowing unsigned scripts to run (though PowerShell protections have improved). The script deletes itself shortly after creation.  This method is often employed to bypass security software that primarily scans files on disk.  This makes it harder to detect because the actual malicious code doesn't exist on the disk for long.\n\n4.  **DLL Loading:**\n    *   The `powershell.exe` process loads several DLLs, including:\n        *   `mscoree.dll`:  The Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) is essential for running .NET code, which PowerShell scripts frequently use.\n        *   `mscoreei.dll`:  Part of the .NET runtime, likely being used for executing .NET components.\n        *   `clr.dll`:  A core .NET framework DLL.\n        *   `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`:  A crucial DLL for PowerShell's scripting engine.\n        *   `MpOAV.dll`:  Windows Defender DLL, suspicious as itâ€™s being loaded by PowerShell. This could indicate that the script is attempting to interact with Windows Defender, possibly to disable it or to avoid detection.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n*   **File Names:**\n    *   `entrada_principal.zip`:  Likely a malicious archive.\n    *   `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`: A temporary script with suspicious naming convention.\n*   **Paths:**\n    *   `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\`:  The user's temporary directory is frequently targeted for malicious activity.\n*   **PowerShell Commands:**\n    *   `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:  Deleting a file from the temporary directory forcefully.\n    *   The use of `$env:Temp` to refer to the user's temporary folder is standard for malicious scripts.\n*   **DLL Loading:**\n    *   The DLLs loaded suggest scripting and .NET execution.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Implement or review EDR solutions to monitor PowerShell execution and detect suspicious behavior.\n2.  **PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Strictly configure PowerShell execution policies to restrict unsigned script execution.  Consider using Constrained Language Mode.\n3.  **Application Whitelisting:**  Implement application whitelisting to restrict the execution of only approved programs.\n4.  **Monitor PowerShell Logs:** Regularly review PowerShell logs for unusual activity.\n5.  **User Education:**  Educate users about the dangers of opening suspicious attachments or clicking on unknown links.\n6.  **Investigate `MpOAV.dll` Loading:** Further investigate why `MpOAV.dll` is being loaded by PowerShell. This may indicate an attempt to disable or evade Windows Defender. Review Windows Defender logs as well.\n7.  **Scan System:** Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus and anti-malware software.\n8.  **Review Account Activity:** Review the activity of the `fiddelis` user account.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided log entries. A more comprehensive investigation may be necessary to fully understand the scope and impact of the attack."}
