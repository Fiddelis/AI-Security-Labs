These commands, combined with PowerShell process access and registry modifications, strongly suggest attempted privilege escalation or unauthorized access.  The repeated creation of SRUtmp.log by svchost.exe may also be suspicious. Finally, downloads of winlogbeat and a file named 'pacote_base.txt' warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
