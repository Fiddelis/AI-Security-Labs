Specifically, user creation commands (`net user`), registry modifications, repeated network connections by chrome.exe, and PowerShell process access are present. A new file was created by powershell.exe which may be suspicious. The creation of multiple temporary files by `sru` (Search Helper) also warrants further examination as it could indicate malicious exploitation of the search indexing service.  The use of 'net.exe' to create users with seemingly randomly generated names also indicates suspicious behaviour.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
