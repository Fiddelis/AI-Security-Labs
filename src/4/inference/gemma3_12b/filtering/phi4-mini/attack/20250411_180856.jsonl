Notable events include `cmd.exe` creating `notepad.exe` (potentially obfuscated process creation), multiple `powershell.exe` process access events, `WMIC.exe` loading several DLLs (including `urlmon.dll` and Defender-related files), registry modifications by multiple processes, and several `powershell.exe` access events. The combination of these events suggests potential reconnaissance, lateral movement, or an attempt to evade detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
