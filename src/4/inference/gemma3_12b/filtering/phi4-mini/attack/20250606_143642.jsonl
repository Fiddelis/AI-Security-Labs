{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The sequence of events indicates a malicious PowerShell script is being executed, likely aimed at removing a file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" and possibly other cleanup actions. Here's a breakdown and interpretation:\n\n**Early Stages (Likely Initial Infection):**\n\n* **`Dism.exe` and DLL Deletion:** The execution of `Dism.exe` along with deletion of DLLs (WimProvider.dll, etc.) within a temporary folder suggests an attempt to evade detection.  `Dism` is a Windows system image management tool; its misuse indicates the attacker is trying to mask their activities. Deleting DLLs associated with imaging and system management is highly suspicious.\n* **`svchost.exe` Registry Modification:** A modification to the Windows Registry by `svchost.exe` is common and needs context.  Malware often hijacks `svchost` to hide activities.\n* **`whoami.exe` Execution:** Executing `whoami.exe` is typical reconnaissance. The attacker wants to know their current user and permissions.\n\n**Main Payload - The PowerShell Script:**\n\n* **PowerShell Access and Command Execution:** The core of the activity revolves around `powershell.exe`.\n* **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` Creation:** The creation of a PowerShell startup profile file is highly concerning. This suggests a persistence mechanismâ€”the script might be designed to run automatically on subsequent system boots. The \"NonInteractive\" part implies it's designed to run without user intervention.\n* **`entrada_principal.zip` Removal:**  The critical command `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` is the most revealing. It forcefully deletes a ZIP file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" located in the temporary directory (`$env:Temp`).  This strongly indicates the presence of a previously downloaded malicious archive (\"entrada_principal.zip\").  The attacker is cleaning up after themselves.\n* **.NET Framework Loading:**  The loading of `mscoreei.dll` and related .NET framework assemblies indicates the PowerShell script relies on .NET functionality.\n\n**Overall Assessment & Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n* **Filename \"entrada_principal.zip\":**  This is a critical IOC.  Any mention of this file should trigger immediate investigation.\n* **Powershell Script Persistence:** The creation of a PowerShell startup profile means the malicious activity might persist across reboots.\n* **DLL Deletion:** The deletion of system DLLs is a strong sign of tampering and attempts at evasion.\n* **Unusual `Dism.exe` Activity:** Any usage of `Dism.exe` outside of legitimate system maintenance is a red flag.\n* **Startup Profile Modification:**  A modified startup profile is a major persistence mechanism for malware.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediate Isolation:**  Isolate the affected system from the network immediately to prevent further spread.\n2. **Malware Scan:** Run a comprehensive, up-to-date malware scan using multiple reputable antivirus and anti-malware tools.\n3. **Startup Profile Review:**  Examine the PowerShell startup profiles (`C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\config\\\\systemprofile\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell`) for any suspicious entries.  Delete the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file.\n4. **System Restore:** If possible, restore the system to a known good state using a system restore point prior to the infection.\n5. **Forensic Analysis:** If the system is critical, consider a forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the compromise and identify the initial infection vector.\n6. **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Tighten PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n7. **Monitor for \"entrada_principal.zip\":**  Actively search for the presence of this file on other systems.\n\nThis attack is likely part of a larger operation, and thorough investigation is essential to prevent re-infection and identify the source of the threat."}
