While some activity is expected from legitimate processes (like `Calculator.exe`, `svchost.exe`), the sheer volume of registry modifications across multiple processes warrants investigation. The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files also suggests potential setup or reconfiguration activity.
