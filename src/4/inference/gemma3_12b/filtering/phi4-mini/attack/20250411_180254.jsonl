The use of 'systeminfo' along with registry queries, and multiple registry events across different processes (including svchost) suggests reconnaissance and potential persistence attempts. Creation of Windows event logs (Parameters.evtx, State.evtx) by svchost, while sometimes legitimate, can also be used to mask malicious activity.
