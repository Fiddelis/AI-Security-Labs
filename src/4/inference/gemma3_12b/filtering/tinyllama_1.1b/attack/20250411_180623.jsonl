The repetition of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks within the PowerShell execution also warrants closer inspection. While some events seem benign (e.g., winlogbeat activity), the combination of PowerShell activities and file deletion raises a potential for malicious activity or at least unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
