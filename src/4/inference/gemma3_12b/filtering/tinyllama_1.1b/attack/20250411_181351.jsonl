Several events involve capturing screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory with varied filenames (elemento_padrao.png, elemento_ativo.png, componente_principal.png, unidade_auxiliar.png, elemento_base.png), which is a strong indicator of potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration. A temporary PowerShell script creation event is also noted. The multiple chrome.exe and Calculator.exe registry value set events are less concerning on their own but contribute to the overall unusual activity. The 'Execute a Remote Command' and 'Executing Pipeline' events, even without a specific process identified, further heighten suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
