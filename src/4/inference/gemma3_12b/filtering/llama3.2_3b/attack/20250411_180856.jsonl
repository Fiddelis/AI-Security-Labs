The repeated use of `WMIC.exe` combined with DLL loads from `urlmon.dll` is concerning and suggests potential reconnaissance or command execution attempts. Although some events appear benign (e.g., `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`), the overall pattern warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
