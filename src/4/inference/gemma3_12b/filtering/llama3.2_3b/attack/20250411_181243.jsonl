The use of PowerShell, combined with the enumeration of user accounts, group memberships, and command key lists, is indicative of reconnaissance activity.  Also notable is the deletion of a PowerShell script after execution, and several events classified as \\\"Provider Lifecycle\\\" and \\\"Engine Lifecycle\\\" related to the same command line, suggesting the execution of a potentially malicious script.
