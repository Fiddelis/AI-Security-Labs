The creation of services with unusual names like 'elemento_principal' and 'tarefa_principal' and references to executable files in unusual locations (C:\\\\elemento_geral, C:\\\\pacote_auxiliar) strongly suggests potential malicious intent. The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for creating and starting services is a common tactic for attackers to achieve persistence.
