This strongly suggests an attempt to hide file modification dates, a common tactic used by attackers to obscure malicious activity. Additionally, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events associated with PowerShell, indicating script execution. While calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is suspicious, it's less concerning than the coordinated PowerShell activity. The registry modification by svchost.exe is less suspicious, but the overall PowerShell behavior warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
