This pattern is highly indicative of potential malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or reconnaissance attempts.  Additionally, the presence of 'Execute a Remote Command' events and repeated registry modifications by Chrome warrant further investigation. The script policy test file creation\/deletion is also suspicious.
