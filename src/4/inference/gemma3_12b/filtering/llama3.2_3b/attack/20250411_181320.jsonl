This is often indicative of reconnaissance activity.  The deletion of a PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1`) after execution is suspicious. Several registry modifications and a special logon event further raise concerns.  While some events appear benign (calculator, winlogbeat, user account management), the combination warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
