The repeated modification of file timestamps on files within several directory structures (e.g., `C:\\\\registro_logico`, `C:\\\\modulo_logico`, `C:\\\\unidade_logico`) is a significant red flag, suggesting an attempt to obscure file modification times.  The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1`) is also suspicious and warrants investigation.
