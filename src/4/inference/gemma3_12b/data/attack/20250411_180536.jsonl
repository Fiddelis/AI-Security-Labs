Specifically, the repeated use of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` combined with the creation of new services and registry modifications, and the use of unusual process names like 'elemento_principal', 'modulo_comum', 'tarefa_principal', etc., strongly suggests a potential ongoing attack involving persistence mechanisms and potentially a trojan-like payload. The image loads involving .NET related DLLs might indicate code injection. The pattern points toward a deliberate effort to establish persistent control.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
