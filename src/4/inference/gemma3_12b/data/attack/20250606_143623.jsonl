{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This log data indicates a potential malicious activity involving the creation and startup of a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell. Let's break down what's happening and assess the risk.\n\n**Key Observations & Interpretation:**\n\n* **PowerShell Activity:**  Multiple log entries highlight PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) being used. This is immediately suspicious, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers to automate tasks and evade detection.\n* **Service Creation:** The PowerShell command `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` is the core of the activity. It attempts to create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" and specifies the executable `tarefa_logico.exe` located in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin` as its binary.\n* **Service Startup:** The command `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"` immediately follows the service creation, attempting to start the newly created service.\n* **Unusual Path:** The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\` is highly suspicious. It's a custom path, not a standard Windows location. This strongly suggests the attacker created this directory to hide the malicious executable.  The \"unidade_logico\" part suggests the attacker may have created a new logical drive or is referencing an existing one.\n* **Repeated Activity:** The pattern repeats multiple times across several log entries, suggesting an attempt to reliably create and start the service.\n* **Lifecycle Events:**  The logs show both \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" which are normal steps in service operation but are flags given the suspicious initial activity.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\n* **High Risk:**  The activity poses a significant risk. Creating and starting services requires elevated privileges and can grant attackers persistent control over the compromised system.  The custom path further emphasizes the malicious intent.\n* **Persistence:**  If the service creation and startup are successful, the attacker can achieve persistence on the system, meaning the malicious activity will continue even after the system is rebooted.\n* **Potential Malware:** `tarefa_logico.exe` is almost certainly malware. It's likely designed to perform actions such as data theft, remote control, or further compromise of the system.\n* **Evasion:** The use of PowerShell and custom paths is a common tactic for attackers to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software.\n\n**Recommendations & Remediation Steps:**\n\n1. **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent the attacker from spreading the malware to other systems.\n2. **Malware Scan:** Perform a full system scan using an updated antivirus solution and anti-malware tools. However, be aware that traditional antivirus may not detect the custom executable.  Consider using more advanced threat hunting tools.\n3. **File Analysis:**  The `tarefa_logico.exe` file is the most critical piece of evidence.\n    * **Quarantine:** Quarantine the file immediately.\n    * **Static Analysis:** Submit it to online malware analysis services like VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, or Any.Run for static analysis. This will provide information about its behavior and purpose.\n    * **Dynamic Analysis:** If possible, perform dynamic analysis in a safe, isolated environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior in a controlled setting.\n4. **Service Removal:** If the \"objeto_ativo\" service was successfully created, manually remove it:\n   * Open Services.msc\n   * Locate \"objeto_ativo\"\n   * Delete the service.\n5. **Path Examination:** Examine the directory `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`\n   * Delete the directory and its contents.\n   * Check for other suspicious files or directories.\n6. **PowerShell Audit:**\n   * Review PowerShell execution logs for other suspicious commands.\n   * Consider tightening PowerShell security policies.\n7. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate how the PowerShell script was executed.  Was it downloaded from a malicious website?  Was it delivered through a phishing email?  Was it part of a compromised software installation?\n8. **System Restore:** As a last resort, consider restoring the system to a previous point in time when it was known to be clean.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Don't rely solely on the log data:**  This is just a snapshot of activity. A full forensic investigation may be necessary to fully understand the scope of the compromise.\n* **Professional Help:** Consider engaging a cybersecurity professional to assist with the investigation and remediation.\n\n\n\nThis situation requires urgent attention and a thorough response to mitigate the risk and prevent further damage.  Provide more information about your environment if you need further assistance in analyzing this incident."}
