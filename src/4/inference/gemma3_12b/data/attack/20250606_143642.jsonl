{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data indicates a series of actions likely performed by a malicious PowerShell script. Here's a breakdown of the observed activity and potential implications, grouped for clarity:\n\n**1. Initial Execution & File Handling:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` (Initial Execution):** The script chain begins with `powershell.exe`. This is the entry point of the malicious activity.\n*   **File Deletion (`powershell.exe`):**  `powershell.exe` attempts to delete a file `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.  The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" naming strongly suggests the script attempts to bypass PowerShell execution policies. This is a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\n**2. Download & Execution (Implied):**\n\n*   The previous command suggests a download occurred and was saved as a `.zip` archive.\n*   The attempted deletion of files in the temporary directory.\n\n**3. PowerShell Environment Manipulation:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` (Registry Value Set):**  A registry value is modified. The specific key being modified isn't visible in this data, but this is often used to alter PowerShell behavior or settings. This can be used to change execution policies, disable modules, or affect how PowerShell handles scripts.\n*   **`powershell.exe` (Image Loads):** Multiple DLLs are loaded within the PowerShell process. These are common components of the .NET framework (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`) and PowerShell itself (`System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`). Their presence isn't inherently malicious, but they are *used* by the malicious script to perform its actions.\n*   **`powershell.exe` (Platform DLL Load):** The script loads `MpOAV.dll`.  This file is associated with Microsoft Defender, which is concerning.  The attacker might be trying to interact with Defender or evade its detection.\n\n**4. Suspicious Activity & Tactics:**\n\n*   **Bypassing PowerShell Execution Policy:** The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" filename is a clear indicator of an attempt to circumvent PowerShell execution policies. This could involve testing policy settings to find a weakness or attempting to temporarily disable policies.\n*   **Temporary File Usage:** The use of temporary files (in `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) is typical for malware to avoid detection and cleanup traces of its activity.\n*   **Microsoft Defender Interaction (Potential):** The loading of `MpOAV.dll` suggests a possible attempt to interact with Microsoft Defender.  This could be for evasion, information gathering, or even malicious modification of Defender’s behavior.\n\n**Summary of Observed Tactics:**\n\n1.  **Circumventing Security Controls:** Attempts to bypass PowerShell execution policies.\n2.  **Obfuscation:** Using temporary files.\n3.  **Potential Evasion:** Interaction with Microsoft Defender.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate the infected machine from the network to prevent further spread.\n2.  **Full System Scan:** Perform a full system scan with an updated anti-malware solution.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:** Carefully review and tighten PowerShell execution policies. Consider using Constrained Language Mode.\n4.  **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement monitoring for PowerShell activity to detect suspicious commands and scripts.\n5.  **Investigate Defender Status:** Check the status and logs of Microsoft Defender to identify any unexpected behavior.\n6.  **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to determine the full extent of the compromise, identify the initial infection vector, and understand the attacker’s objectives.\n7.  **Review System Logs:** Examine Windows Event Logs for any other related events, especially around the time of the initial compromise.\n8.  **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Look for persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks, startup entries, registry modifications) that may allow the malware to re-infect the system.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A full investigation may be required to gain a complete understanding of the incident."}
