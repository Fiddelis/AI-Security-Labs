This includes command-line execution of `systeminfo` and `reg query`, coupled with PowerShell and cmd.exe activity. The loading of AMSI and Windows Defender Platform DLLs by `systeminfo.exe` might indicate an attempt to evade detection. Repeated registry modifications by multiple processes (cmd, powershell, svchost, notepad, conhost) are also concerning.  The creation of EVTX logs by svchost, unusual DLL loading, and special logon events further heighten suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
