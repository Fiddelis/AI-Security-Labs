{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"The log appears to be from an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) setup, specifically from the Winlogbeat module which collects Windows event logs. Here's a breakdown of the log:\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe log consists of multiple events, each represented by a JSON object with several key-value pairs. The keys indicate the type of data being reported, and the values contain the actual data.\n\n**Fields in the Log**\n\nThe log has the following fields:\n\n1. **`process`**: Information about the process that triggered the event (e.g., name, ID).\n2. **`winlog`**: Windows event log information (e.g., task, rule).\n3. **`file`**: File-related information (e.g., path, name).\n\n**Event Types**\n\nThe events in the log are categorized into several types:\n\n1. **Process Create** (`\"process\": {\"name\": \"winlogbeat.exe\"}`): Indicates that a new process was created.\n2. **File Created** (`\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"`): Reports that a file was created.\n3. **Registry Value Set** (`\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`): Logs when a registry value was modified.\n4. **Image Loaded** (`\"task\": \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"`): Indicates that an image or executable was loaded into memory.\n5. **Dns Query** (`\"task\": \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\"`): Reports on DNS queries made by the system.\n\n**Files Created**\n\nThere are two instances where a file is reported as being created:\n\n1. `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`\n2. `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`\n\n**Registry Events**\n\nThere are multiple instances where registry values were set or modified:\n\n1. **`\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`**\n\t* Occurs 8 times, with no specific registry key or value mentioned.\n2. **`\"task\": \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\"`**\n\n**Dns Query**\n\nThere is one instance of a DNS query being made:\n\n1. `\"task\": \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\"`\n\n**Process Information**\n\nThe log contains information about various processes, including:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat.exe**\n2. **Sppsvc.exe**\n3. **Notepad.exe**\n4. **SVCHOST.EXE** ( multiple instances)\n5. **Chrome.exe** (multiple instances)\n\nThis analysis provides an overview of the types of events being reported in the log and highlights specific instances that may be of interest for further investigation."}
