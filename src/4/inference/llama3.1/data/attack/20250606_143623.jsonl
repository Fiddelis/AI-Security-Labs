{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file in JSON format, containing events related to Windows processes and system activity. Here's an analysis of the data:\n\n**Recurring Patterns**\n\nThe last few entries in the log show a recurring pattern:\n```json\n{\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\nThis pattern indicates that a PowerShell process is creating a new service with the name \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`. This is done repeatedly, with each iteration using the same command-line arguments.\n\n**Potential Red Flag**\n\nThe repeated creation of this service may indicate a malicious activity. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" and the binary path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` might be suspicious, as they don't seem to match any known Windows system services or standard PowerShell commands.\n\n**Other Observations**\n\n* Some entries have a missing \"process\" field, which could indicate that the corresponding event doesn't pertain to a specific process.\n* The `winlog` field often has the same value, indicating a repeated task or event (e.g., \"Provider Lifecycle\").\n* Some entries have a \"file\" field with a specific path, but it's not clear what this represents.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Investigate the service creation and its implications:\n\t* Research the service name \"objeto_ativo\" and its binary path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\t* Check if there are any system or security alerts related to this activity.\n2. Verify the authenticity of the log entries:\n\t* Ensure that the log is not tampered with or manipulated in any way.\n3. Analyze the PowerShell command-line arguments:\n\t* Break down the PowerShell script and understand what it does.\n\t* Check if there are any unusual commands, syntax, or libraries used.\n\nPlease note that this analysis provides only a high-level overview of the data. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause of the activity and its potential impact on the system's security."}
