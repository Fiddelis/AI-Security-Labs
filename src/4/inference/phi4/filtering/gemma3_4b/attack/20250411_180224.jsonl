This is a common technique in privilege escalation and persistence strategies used by attackers. Additionally, there are numerous registry value modifications associated with processes like cmd.exe, svchost.exe, and chrome.exe, which could indicate attempts at maintaining unauthorized access or altering system configurations. The repeated use of 'winlogbeat' to create files also raises concerns as it might be an attempt to manipulate logging mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
