Additionally, there are registry modifications by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, often exploited by attackers for persistence.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries followed by the creation of a suspicious LNK file, which could indicate command and control communication or malware execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe batch contains several events involving `EXCEL.EXE`, where multiple DNS queries occur in quick succession, followed by the creation of an unusual `.LNK` file associated with a CSV file (`real_values.csv.LNK`). The repeated nature of these actions and the specific combination of DNS activity followed by LNK file creation is indicative of potential malicious behavior. This pattern often correlates with command and control (C2) activities or attempts to execute malware through shortcuts, which justifies its classification as \"INTERESTING.\" The confidence level reflects a high likelihood of suspicion but acknowledges that additional context could be needed for absolute certainty."}
