Additionally, the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe in unusual locations suggests potential manipulation or persistence mechanisms. The image loaded event for WindowsCamera.exe accessing urlmon.dll is also unusual, as this DLL is typically associated with internet-related processes, not camera operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
