There are multiple file creation events for 'arquivo.txt' by notepad.exe, which is unusual and potentially indicative of data exfiltration or script execution. The image load event for 'urlmon.dll', a library associated with Internet Explorer and known as an exploitation target, is also noteworthy. Additionally, the use of rundll32.exe to create a local server run DLL points towards potential misuse for remote code execution. These combined activities suggest a need for further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
