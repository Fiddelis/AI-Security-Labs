This indicates potential use of an obfuscation technique to hide malicious activity. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications associated with 'cmd.exe' and 'chrome.exe', which could be indicative of persistence mechanisms or additional malware behavior. The presence of these activities in conjunction suggests a coordinated effort to execute and conceal malicious actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
