There are also suspicious activities such as modifying Domain Admins group membership using net commands, which could indicate privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, there are repetitive file creations by svchost.exe on the same path (SRUtmp.log) that might suggest log tampering or use of a legitimate process for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
