While some commands are benign (e.g., `Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`), others scan INF files for specific registry keys.\n\n2. **INF File Analysis**: Commands that search through INF files for `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` sections could be indicative of probing for supported architectures or preparing for exploitation, as these sections often contain installation instructions.\n\n3. **Task Context**: The commands are associated with tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. While these might be legitimate in some contexts (e.g., software lifecycle management), the specific actions performed by the scripts warrant further investigation due to their potential misuse.\n\n4. **Execution Policy**: The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests that the environment is trying to enforce security policies, yet these commands are still being executed, which could indicate either a bypass or an administrative privilege exploitation.\n\n5. **Frequency and Consistency**: The consistent execution of similar scripts across different tasks suggests a coordinated activity rather than isolated benign processes.\n\nGiven these factors, the batch warrants further investigation due to its potential implications for security. The confidence level is set at 0.85, reflecting a strong suspicion based on observed patterns but acknowledging that without additional context or behavior analysis, absolute certainty cannot be achieved."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries indicate a sequence of events involving PowerShell commands, service creation, and interactions with the Windows Event Log system. Here's a breakdown of what is happening:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - Multiple instances show a PowerShell process being created to execute a command that involves creating a new Windows Service named \"objeto_ativo\". This service points to an executable at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - After creation, the service is immediately started.\n\n2. **Service Lifecycle Events:**\n   - These logs are categorized as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\", suggesting they are part of a monitoring or logging tool that tracks the lifecycle events of services on the system.\n   - This could be for auditing purposes to ensure unauthorized changes aren't made to service configurations or executions.\n\n3. **PowerShell Execution Policy:**\n   - There is a command shown using PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which indicates scripts can only run if they are signed by a trusted publisher, preventing untrusted scripts from executing.\n   - The command `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` is executed, likely for testing or logging purposes.\n\n4. **File Paths and Commands:**\n   - The repeated use of the same file path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`) in service creation suggests either a setup routine or a repetitive task being automated.\n   - It's important to verify if `tarefa_logico.exe` is legitimate, as it could be benign software installation or potentially malicious.\n\n5. **Windows Event Log System:**\n   - The events are logged through the Windows Event Log system, which records various system activities like security audits and application-specific operations.\n   - These logs help in tracking what actions were performed on the machine over time for security and troubleshooting purposes.\n\n**Security Considerations:**\n\n- Verify if `tarefa_logico.exe` is a legitimate file from a trusted source. \n- Review who has permissions to create services, as this could be an indicator of privilege escalation.\n- Ensure that execution policies are set appropriately according to your organization's security policy to prevent unauthorized script executions.\n\nOverall, these logs might be part of standard operations or indicative of an attempt to execute or deploy software on the system. Further investigation into `tarefa_logico.exe` and who initiated these commands would help determine their legitimacy."}
