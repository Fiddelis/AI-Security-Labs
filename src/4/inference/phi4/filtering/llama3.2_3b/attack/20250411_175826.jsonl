{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell scripts altering file timestamps and legitimate processes like Chrome frequently setting registry values indicate potential suspicious activity that merits further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\nThe batch contains several events involving PowerShell commands that modify the `LastWriteTime` attributes of files to a specific date (`01\/01\/1970`). This can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate file activities, which is often seen in malicious operations such as data hiding or tampering. These modifications are not typical behavior for standard administrative tasks and suggest potential security threats.\n\nAdditionally, the frequent registry value changes by `chrome.exe` could imply either automated scripting or misuse if these actions are out of ordinary user patterns or configurations. While Chrome regularly interacts with the Windows Registry (e.g., for updates or settings), abnormal frequency or pattern in such events can be a red flag.\n\nThe presence of legitimate processes like `calc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` performing expected actions is noted, but they do not detract from the suspicious nature of other entries. The overall combination of these activities supports classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation into possible malicious behavior or unauthorized system manipulation."}
