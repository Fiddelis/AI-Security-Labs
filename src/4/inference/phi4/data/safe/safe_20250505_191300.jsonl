While it's normal for applications like Discord to establish network connections, the repeated pattern might indicate unusual behavior or a compromised instance.\n\n2. **Activity Involving SDXHelper.exe**: This executable is known to be associated with adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). The logs show it loading system DLLs (`combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`) which could suggest attempts to interact with the system in an unintended manner.\n\n3. **Discord File Creation Time Change**: There's a log entry indicating a change in file creation time for a temporary Discord-related file, which might be suspicious if not part of normal operations.\n\n4. **Process Access and Pipe Events**: Multiple process access logs and pipe creation events involving `Discord.exe` could indicate attempts to interact with other processes or services, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch warrants further investigation to determine if any malicious activity is occurring."}
