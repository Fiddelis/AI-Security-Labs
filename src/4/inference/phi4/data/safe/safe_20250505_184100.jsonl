These include loading images (DLLs), creating pipes, and accessing processesâ€”typical actions during normal use.\n\n2. **No Anomalies Detected**: There are no unusual patterns or known malicious indicators present in these logs. The commands and file paths involved align with standard operation practices for Discord applications on a Windows system.\n\n3. **Confidence Level**: High confidence is placed in the classification of \"NOT INTERESTING\" as all observed activities correspond to expected, benign behavior without any suspicious elements or deviations from normal operations."}
