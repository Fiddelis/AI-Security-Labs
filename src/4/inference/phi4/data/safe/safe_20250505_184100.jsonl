These activities are typical for Discord's operation.\n\n2. **Windows Update Activity**: Events related to `Update.exe` involve file creation and process access within expected directories (e.g., Start Menu programs). These actions align with normal Windows update operations.\n\n3. **No Suspicious Indicators**: There are no signs of unusual command-line arguments, unauthorized file paths, or abnormal process interactions that would suggest malicious activity.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: The confidence is high (0.9) in the classification as \"NOT INTERESTING\" due to the lack of any red flags typically associated with cybersecurity threats."}
