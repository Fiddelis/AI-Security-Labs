This behavior is indicative of reconnaissance, where an attacker might be looking to understand or exploit system configurations.\n\n2. **Potential Threat Indication**: The use of `powershell.exe` with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests attempts to bypass execution policy restrictions, a common tactic used by attackers to evade security controls while still executing malicious scripts.\n\n3. **Contextual Concerns**: While the batch also includes benign activities like service management and logon tasks, these do not negate the potential risk posed by the repeated script executions.\n\n4. **Relevance for Investigation**: The combination of reconnaissance-like behavior through PowerShell scripting in multiple entries makes this batch relevant for further investigation to determine if it is part of a broader attack campaign or malicious activity on the system. \n\n5. **Confidence Level**: The confidence level of 0.85 reflects a high degree of suspicion based on the pattern and nature of the activities observed, though absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed without additional context or data."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided data seems to be a series of structured log entries, likely from a Windows system. Each entry contains information about processes, associated Windows event logs (WinLog), and any related files. Here's an analysis of the key components in these log entries:\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Process:**\n   - Contains details about running or terminated processes.\n   - Includes attributes like `name` and `command_line`.\n\n2. **Winlog:**\n   - Provides context about what event triggered the log entry, such as \"Registry value set\" or \"Image loaded.\"\n   - Often specifies a rule associated with the event (e.g., `ProcessCreate`, `RegistryEvent`).\n\n3. **File:**\n   - Specifies file paths related to events when applicable.\n   - Some entries have no related files (`None`), indicating that the log entry isn't tied to specific files.\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Repeated Entries:**\n   - There are multiple repeated commands for creating and starting a service named `objeto_ativo`. This indicates an automated or script-driven action, likely part of software installation or system configuration.\n   - The PowerShell command used is:\n     ```powershell\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" \\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - This command creates a new Windows service and starts it immediately.\n\n2. **Common Processes:**\n   - `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are standard processes involved in managing system services, software protection, and hosting various Windows services respectively.\n   \n3. **Event Logs:**\n   - Events like \"Registry value set\" or \"Image loaded\" suggest changes to the system configuration or loading of executable files into memory.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle:**\n   - Entries with tasks such as \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" might relate to monitoring software that tracks lifecycle events for services or applications.\n\n### Potential Security Implications\n\n- The creation and starting of a service via PowerShell can be benign, especially if it's part of legitimate software installation. However, repeated creation attempts could indicate malicious intent, such as the deployment of malware.\n  \n- Monitoring changes in the registry and loaded images is crucial for detecting unauthorized or harmful modifications to system configurations.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Review Service Creation:** Investigate why `objeto_ativo` is being created multiple times. Verify whether it's part of legitimate software operations.\n  \n- **Analyze PowerShell Usage:** Ensure that PowerShell scripts are authorized and not executing malicious commands. Implement controls on script execution if necessary.\n\n- **Log Monitoring:** Continuously monitor logs for anomalies, such as unusual registry changes or service creations, to detect potential security threats early.\n\nThis analysis provides a structured understanding of the log entries, which can be further investigated by system administrators or security professionals for any irregularities."}
