Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications by processes like `svchost.exe`, which is often used for legitimate system tasks but can be abused by malware. The frequent usage of `chrome.exe` for registry changes and the creation of files using `winlogbeat.exe` and `powershell.exe` also suggest possible unauthorized or suspicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
