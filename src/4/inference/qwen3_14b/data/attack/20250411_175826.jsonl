{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Multiple network connections might be part of regular browsing, but maybe if there's a lot, but here it's just a few entries. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used for certain tasks, especially with commands that modify files or registry, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at one of the powershell entries: the command_line shows something like Get-ChildItem with paths that have strange directory structures, like \"C:\\\\registro_logico\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\..\\\\unidade_ativo\\\\objeto_padraounidade_padrao.txt\". The use of \"..\\\\\" might indicate trying to access parent directories, which could be part of a path traversal attack. Also, setting the LastWriteTime to 1\/1\/1970 is a common technique to modify timestamps, which might be used to hide the time a file was modified, possibly to evade detection.\n\nAnother command_line has \"Get-ChildItem \\\"C:\\\\modulo_logico\\\\registro_base\\\\..\\\\componente_padrao\\\\modulo_logicoelemento_ativo.txt\\\" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = \\\"01\\\/01\\\/1970 00:00:00\\\" }}\". Similar pattern here. Changing file timestamps is suspicious, especially if done in a way that's not typical for normal operations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .dll files. Some of these are standard, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. But the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but combined with other activities, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother thing is the creation and deletion of a temporary file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating and then immediately deleting a file could be part of a malicious activity to execute scripts without leaving traces. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a misleading name to appear legitimate, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are PipeEvent entries, which could be related to inter-process communication. While not inherently bad, if combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate something more.\n\nThe user is fiddelis, and the paths mentioned have some non-standard names, which might be obfuscation. The repetition of modifying timestamps on multiple files across different directories could be an attempt to alter evidence or manipulate system files.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell commands modifying timestamps, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the unusual directory paths all point towards potentially malicious activity. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination of these events is more than just normal system behavior. It's likely a script trying to evade detection by altering timestamps and using temporary files. Therefore, this batch is interesting and should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potentially suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Scripting with Suspicious File Manipulation**\n- **Timestamp Tampering**: Multiple PowerShell commands modify the `LastWriteTime` of files to **January 1, 1970** (Unix epoch). This is a common tactic to **obfuscate file activity** or evade detection by making files appear \"old\" or inactive.\n  - Example:  \n    ```powershell\n    Get-ChildItem \"C:\\modulo_logico\\registro_base\\..\\\" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\" }\n    ```\n  - **Why Suspicious?** Modifying timestamps is unusual in normal user behavior and could indicate an attempt to **hide malicious file operations**.\n\n- **Path Traversal**: The scripts use paths with `..\\\"` (e.g., `C:\\registro_logico\\estrutura_secundario\\..\\\"), suggesting **unusual directory navigation**. This could be an attempt to access files outside the intended scope or evade path-based security controls.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary File Creation and Deletion**\n- A temporary PowerShell script file is created and immediately deleted:  \n  ```plaintext\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1\n  ```\n  - **Why Suspicious?** The creation and deletion of a temporary file in the `Temp` directory, especially with a name like `__PSScriptPolicyTest`, may indicate **script execution** or **attempted obfuscation** (e.g., to avoid leaving traces of malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual PowerShell Activity**\n- **Frequent `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` Logs**: PowerShell is invoked repeatedly with no clear user context, and registry modifications are logged. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, **excessive or unexplained usage** (especially with script blocks) raises red flags.\n- **Pipe Creation**: A `PipeEvent` is logged, which could be used for **inter-process communication**. While not inherently malicious, this may indicate **data exfiltration** or **command-and-control (C2) communication** if combined with other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Obfuscation in File\/Directory Names**\n- The paths referenced in the scripts (e.g., `modulo_logico`, `registro_base`, `estrutura_secundario`) use **non-standard, obfuscated terms**. This could be an attempt to **mask the true purpose** of the files or directories, possibly to evade detection by signature-based tools.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Windows Defender Component (MpOAV.dll)**\n- PowerShell loads **`MpOAV.dll`** (part of Windows Defender). While this is a legitimate component, its presence in this context may indicate **an attempt to bypass security software** (e.g., by exploiting Defender's APIs) or **a false flag** to mimic benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **behavior consistent with a script attempting to evade detection** by:\n- Modifying file timestamps.\n- Using obfuscated paths and temporary files.\n- Leveraging PowerShell for potentially malicious operations.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Investigate the user account** (`fiddelis`) for unauthorized access or lateral movement.\n- **Analyze the PowerShell scripts** (even if deleted) via log reconstruction or memory forensics.\n- **Check for persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks).\n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to confirm if this is part of a broader attack.\n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the logs to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that modify the LastWriteTime of files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That date is significant because it's the Unix epoch, often used by attackers to hide files or make them appear older. The paths mentioned are all over different directories, which might be a way to evade detection by not focusing on a single location.\n\nThen, there are several entries with 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. While 'calc.exe' is a legitimate process, the fact that it's loading a DLL from the System32 directory might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag. However, I don't see any obvious malicious activity here yet.\n\nNext, there are 'svchost.exe' processes setting registry values. 'svchost.exe' is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be part of normal operations, but if done in a suspicious pattern, it might indicate something. However, there's not enough context here to confirm that.\n\nThe 'powershell.exe' processes are involved in various tasks like file creation and registry changes. One entry shows a file created in the user's AppData directory, which is common for legitimate software but could also be used by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory seems normal, as Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool. The rest of the entries are mostly about registry changes and process access, which are typical in a Windows environment.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious part is the repeated use of PowerShell to modify file timestamps to the Unix epoch. This is a known tactic used by attackers to hide files or manipulate timestamps to avoid detection. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond that. The other events don't show clear signs of compromise, but the PowerShell commands alone might be worth investigating further. The confidence isn't extremely high, but the presence of those specific commands suggests it's worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, primarily due to the following indicators:\n\n### 1. **PowerShell Timestamp Manipulation**\n   - **Multiple PowerShell commands** are observed modifying the `LastWriteTime` of files to **\"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\"** (Unix epoch time). This is a **common tactic used by attackers** to:\n     - **Hide files** by making them appear \"ancient\" or non-recent.\n     - **Evade detection** by altering timestamps to avoid triggering alerts based on time-based anomalies.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     (Get-Item \"C:\\path\\to\\file\").LastWriteTime = [datetime]\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"\n     ```\n\n### 2. **Unusual File Paths and Context**\n   - The modified files are referenced in **non-standard or obfuscated paths**, which could indicate **malicious persistence** or **data exfiltration**.\n   - No clear justification is provided for why these files are being timestamped to the Unix epoch, which is **highly unusual in legitimate scenarios**.\n\n### 3. **Lateral Movement or Privilege Escalation Indicators**\n   - While not explicitly malicious, the combination of **PowerShell timestamp manipulation** with **registry changes** (e.g., `Registry value set`) and **file creation** (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) could hint at:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup scripts).\n     - **Privilege escalation** or **misconfiguration** attempts.\n\n### 4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**\n   - Other events (e.g., `calc.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are **common legitimate processes** and may not be inherently suspicious.\n   - However, **correlation** with the timestamp manipulation and file\/path anomalies increases the **risk score**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Classification**: **Suspicious** (likely benign but requires deeper analysis).\n- **Recommendation**:  \n  - Investigate the **PowerShell commands** for their full context (e.g., script source, user context, permissions).  \n  - Check for **unauthorized file modifications** in the paths referenced.  \n  - Monitor for **anomalies in registry changes** or **unusual process behavior** (e.g., PowerShell used for non-admin tasks).  \n  - Consider **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to correlate these events with broader system activity.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **Medium** (the timestamp manipulation is a strong red flag, but further evidence is needed to confirm malicious intent)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the entries here involve 'chrome.exe' with tasks related to registry value sets (RegistryEvent) or image loaded (ImageLoad). There are a few other processes like winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, but they seem to be creating files in user directories, which might be normal. \n\nNow, looking at the registry events. Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but the frequency here is high. There are multiple entries of 'Registry value set' by chrome.exe. However, the ImageLoad events are also present. The files loaded are amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. \n\nBut why would chrome.exe be loading these DLLs? Typically, these are system-level components. If chrome is loading them, maybe there's some interaction with the system's security features. However, it's also possible that this is normal behavior if Chrome is interacting with the system's security APIs. \n\nBut then again, if there are multiple registry changes and image loads, maybe there's some malicious activity trying to modify the registry or inject code. However, the presence of legitimate DLLs might indicate that it's just Chrome using those components. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format. Let me check again. The entries with 'Registry value set' are repeated many times. But none of them have specific details about which registry keys are being modified. That's a bit concerning. Without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. \n\nAlso, the ImageLoad events: loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll from their standard paths. Those paths are part of the Windows Defender installation. So if Chrome is loading those DLLs from the correct locations, that's probably normal. However, if they were loaded from unexpected locations, that would be a red flag. \n\nThe other events, like the creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new and unidade_logico.txt, seem to be user activities. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. The text file created by PowerShell might be part of a script, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nPutting this all together: the majority of events are from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. However, without more context on the specific registry keys or other suspicious activities, it's hard to determine if this is malicious. The presence of legitimate DLLs being loaded might be normal. \n\nBut the high number of registry events could be a sign of something. Maybe Chrome is being used as a vector for some activity. However, without more data, such as unusual registry keys, process injections, or network activity, it's not enough to classify this as definitely interesting. \n\nSo, considering all that, the batch might not be interesting enough. The events don't show clear signs of malicious activity beyond normal operations. The confidence is moderate because while there's a lot of registry activity, it's not enough to confirm a threat without more information.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repetitive registry modification events by chrome.exe and legitimate DLL loads (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) from standard Windows Defender paths. No clear indicators of compromise, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
