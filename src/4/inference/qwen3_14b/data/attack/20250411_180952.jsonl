{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. First, I'll go through each entry.\n\nStarting with svchost.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, as svchost hosts various system services. Then MpDefenderCoreService.exe has a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so probably legitimate. Chrome.exe has several DNS queries and network connections. That's expected for a browser. \n\nThen there's powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami is a standard command to check user context, so that's normal. But then there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. That could be suspicious if there's a lot of activity, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries. One command line stands out: adding a user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with a password and adding to Domain Admins. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a major security issue. Also, the command uses \"net\" and \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a malicious binary. The passwords have \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and similar, which look like temporary passwords, possibly used for lateral movement. \n\nThen there's the creation of files like .winlogbeat.yml.new and pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating files in the Downloads directory might not be suspicious unless there's unexpected configuration changes. However, the repeated file creation by svchost.exe for SRUtmp.log is normal as part of system logging.\n\nThe key suspicious points are the creation of domain admin accounts using cmd.exe with net commands, the use of potentially malicious binaries (net1.exe), and the multiple registry changes. These actions indicate someone trying to escalate privileges or set up persistent access. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points to a potential security breach. \n\nConfidence is high because creating domain admin accounts is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The presence of multiple registry modifications and the use of command-line tools to add users to sensitive groups are strong indicators. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net' commands, potential credential dumping (complex passwords in commands), use of 'net1.exe' (likely malicious), and repeated registry modifications. These indicate possible privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
