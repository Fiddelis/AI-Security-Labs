{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The events include 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' which might be normal, but repeated access to processes could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's one instance where cmd.exe is used with attrib.exe to set a file as hidden. That might be hiding files, which is suspicious. Also, the 'whoami.exe' is run, which is usually benign but could be part of information gathering.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but if it's part of a setup, maybe not. However, the same file is mentioned twice, which could be normal or maybe an attempt to overwrite or modify settings.\n\nAnother point is the multiple 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that might indicate something unusual. Also, the loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe—those are security-related DLLs. If chrome is loading them, maybe it's being used to bypass security checks, but that's a stretch without more context.\n\nHowever, there are also legitimate processes like svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. The presence of Calculator.exe and chrome.exe doing registry changes might be part of normal operations, but the frequency and the specific commands need to be checked. \n\nThe key suspicious points are the repeated use of powershell and cmd for potentially malicious actions, the hidden file creation, and the registry modifications by chrome. But without more context, like network activity or other indicators, it's hard to be certain. However, the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell process accesses, CMD usage with file hiding attempts (attrib +h), Chrome.exe modifying registry values (unusual for a browser), and Winlogbeat creating configuration files. These patterns may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a mix of processes involved. The first event is about powershell.exe creating a file called pacote_base.txt in the Downloads directory. That might be normal, but then there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. A lot of them—like eight times. That seems unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much, especially repeatedly. \n\nThen there are a couple of other powershell.exe events related to process access. The whoami.exe process is also present, which is a standard command to check user identity. But the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe are suspicious. Malware sometimes uses registry modifications to persist or alter system behavior. The fact that it's happening multiple times could indicate an attempt to modify the registry in a way that's not typical for Chrome.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a legitimate reason. Maybe a Chrome extension or some legitimate software is causing this. But without more context, the repeated events and the combination with powershell activities (which are often used in attacks) raises a red flag. The file creation by powershell could be part of initial access, and the registry changes might be part of persistence. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. There's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity definitively, but the pattern is enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the unusual number of registry changes by chrome.exe and the combination with powershell activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances performing repeated registry value sets (unusual for Chrome), combined with powershell.exe file creation and process access events, suggests potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
