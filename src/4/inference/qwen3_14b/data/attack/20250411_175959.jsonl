{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate since it's part of Google's crash reporting. Then there's cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which is normal for checking stored credentials. Next, powershell.exe is accessed, and then there's a command line that runs several commands like net user, get-localuser, and cmdkey \/list. That looks suspicious because it's enumerating users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThen there are a bunch of Security Group Management and User Account Management events, which might indicate someone is trying to manipulate user permissions or groups. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll might be normal, but sometimes these can be exploited. However, the most concerning part is the PowerShell script that's running multiple commands to gather system information. That's a common tactic in attacks to gather data before escalating privileges or moving laterally. \n\nEven though some processes are legitimate, the combination of accessing sensitive commands, enumerating users, and using PowerShell for multiple system queries raises a red flag.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal activity for a log shipper. Maybe part of configuration.\n\nSecond: SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Not sure what SDXHelper is, but loading system DLLs isn't necessarily bad. Could be part of legitimate software.\n\nThird: powershell.exe created a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell creating files is common, but the name is generic. Not suspicious yet.\n\nFourth: MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was run with command line arguments. The command seems related to scheduled updates. That's probably legitimate.\n\nNext two svchost.exe entries about registry values. svchost is a normal system process, and registry changes can be part of normal operations. Not suspicious.\n\nThen MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loaded taskschd.dll. That's part of Task Scheduler, which is normal for updates.\n\nbackgroundTaskHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll again. Again, urlmon is a system DLL used by various processes. Not necessarily bad.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file. Maybe a configuration file being written, which is normal during setup.\n\nThen powershell.exe accessing registry and process access. Again, PowerShell doing registry stuff is common, but not suspicious unless there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at all events together: most are normal system activities. The only thing that stands out is the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe. However, winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection. The other processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and svchost are standard. No signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual processes, or suspicious file paths. The file paths are in standard locations like Downloads and System32. No anomalies detected. So, probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system activities (e.g., legitimate process execution, standard file creation by log shippers, and routine registry operations).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's running a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, etc. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That might be normal, but when combined with the command line, it could indicate that the PowerShell script is doing more than usual. Also, there's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That's interesting because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThe command line in the PowerShell process includes commands that check user accounts, list groups, and look into the file system. This could be part of an attacker trying to map out the system's structure and find potential targets. The fact that the script is being run with multiple commands that access sensitive information (like user credentials via cmdkey.exe) might be a red flag.\n\nI should also check if there are any other suspicious activities. The other chrome.exe events don't seem harmful, but the PowerShell activity is more concerning. The combination of these events—especially the file creation and deletion, the multiple registry and process access events—suggests that something unusual is happening. The presence of multiple Image Load events might be normal, but when paired with the other activities, it could indicate a more complex attack.\n\nConfidence-wise, I think there's enough here to warrant further investigation. The justification would be the suspicious PowerShell commands and the file operations that could be part of an attack. So, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including command-line execution of system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), file creation\/deletion of temporary scripts, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants me to analyze these system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by looking at the events provided.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and a command line that includes a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands seem to be gathering information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because typically, such commands are used in reconnaissance phases of an attack. The same command line is repeated several times, which might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, possibly to collect more data or to avoid detection.\n\nThen, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but I need to check if there's anything suspicious here. The file path seems to be in the Downloads directory, which isn't unusual. However, the presence of winlogbeat might be part of a legitimate setup, but combined with other events, it's something to note.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file called \"pacote_ativo.txt\" in the Downloads folder. That's a user-created file, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, it might be worth looking into.\n\nThere are several entries related to chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome often modifies the registry for updates or settings, so this might be normal. However, multiple entries in a short time could indicate some automated process, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the other processes: net.exe and net1.exe running \"user\" commands. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows process; the correct one is net.exe. The presence of net1.exe might be a typo or a malicious executable trying to mimic a legitimate one. That's suspicious.\n\nThe Image loaded events for MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll are part of Windows Defender and URLMon, which are legitimate. However, if these are loaded in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something else, but I don't see that here.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The repeated use of PowerShell to gather system information, the presence of a possibly malicious executable (net1.exe), and the creation of files by PowerShell could indicate an attacker trying to map the system and possibly set up persistence. The fact that the same command is run multiple times under different tasks (Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle) might suggest that the process is being monitored or that there's an attempt to evade detection.\n\nHowever, some events might be benign. For example, winlogbeat creating a config file is part of its normal operation. The Chrome registry changes are also likely legitimate. But the combination of PowerShell reconnaissance and the suspicious net1.exe process raises concerns. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of a breach, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to enumerate system users, groups, and credentials (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list'), which is indicative of reconnaissance activities. Additionally, the presence of 'net1.exe' (a suspicious variant of 'net.exe') and file creation by PowerShell in user directories raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
