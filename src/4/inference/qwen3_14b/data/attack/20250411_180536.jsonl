{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see some powershell.exe processes with ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. However, just having ProcessAccess might not be enough on its own.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious by itself. But then, looking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe commands to create and start services. The command line has some paths that look like they might be part of a malicious payload. For example, creating a service with a path like \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\" â€“ those long, obfuscated filenames are a red flag. Also, using sc.exe to create and start services is something that could be part of a persistence mechanism, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThen there are several events where services.exe and sc.exe are modifying registry values. Modifying the registry, especially related to services, could indicate an attempt to alter system behavior or install backdoors. The fact that multiple services are being created and registry keys are being set might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the image load events, there are references to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context or by unexpected processes, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, in this case, the processes named (like tarefa_base.exe, estrutura_principal.exe) don't seem to be standard Windows processes. Their names are in Portuguese, which might be a way to obfuscate the true purpose of the executable. Also, the paths where these DLLs are loaded from are standard system directories, so that's not immediately suspicious, but the combination with the other events might be.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of multiple service creations using sc.exe, registry modifications, and the use of non-standard process names could indicate an attempt to install a backdoor or persistent malware. The fact that these activities are spread across different processes and events, and involve both PowerShell and command-line tools, suggests a possible attack chain. However, some of these events might be part of legitimate software installations or system management tasks. But given the obfuscation in filenames and the use of sc.exe for service creation, it's leaning towards being a security incident. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a mix of normal system behavior and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlights**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`:**\n   - **Command-line example:**  \n     `sc.exe create [ServiceName] binPath= \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\"`  \n     - **Red Flags:**  \n       - **Obfuscated filenames** (e.g., `modulo_geral`, `unidade_base`) and paths suggest potential **malware persistence** or **custom payloads**.  \n       - Use of `sc.exe` to create services is common in **malware** for **persistence** or **post-exploitation**.  \n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `elemento_ativo.exe`** are modifying registry keys.  \n   - **Implication:** Could indicate **tampering with system settings**, **credential dumping**, or **registry-based persistence** (e.g., injecting malicious code into startup entries).\n\n3. **Non-Standard Process Names:**\n   - **Examples:** `modulo_secundario.exe`, `estrutura_principal.exe`, `tarefa_logico.exe`.  \n   - **Analysis:** While not inherently malicious, the **Portuguese-based naming** may be used for **obfuscation** or **social engineering** (e.g., mimicking legitimate software).\n\n4. **Image Load Events with .NET DLLs:**\n   - **DLLs loaded:** `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`.  \n   - **Context:** These are legitimate .NET components, but their loading by **non-standard executables** (e.g., `estrutura_principal.exe`) raises concerns about **DLL hijacking** or **malicious code injection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Behavior**\n- **Normal Activity:**  \n  - Chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections.  \n  - PowerShell and `whoami.exe` for administrative tasks.  \n  - Standard .NET DLLs loaded by legitimate processes.\n\n- **Suspicious Behavior:**  \n  - **Unusual service creation paths** and **registry modifications** without clear user context.  \n  - **Lack of logging** or **user interaction** details (e.g., no indication of user-initiated actions).  \n  - **Absence of known benign processes** associated with the suspicious filenames.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Check for Malware Signatures:**  \n   - Analyze the suspicious binaries (e.g., `unidade_base.exe`, `modulo_secundario.exe`) using **YARA rules**, **hash lookup** (VirusTotal), or **sandboxing**.  \n   - Verify if the DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are legitimate (e.g., via digital signatures or file integrity checks).\n\n2. **Audit Service Configuration:**  \n   - Investigate the **created services** (e.g., `modulo_geral`) for **unexpected behavior** (e.g., network connections, file modifications).  \n   - Check **service permissions** and **owners** to detect unauthorized access.\n\n3. **Review User Context:**  \n   - Determine if the activities were initiated by **privileged users** (e.g., admin accounts) or **compromised credentials**.  \n   - Correlate with **SIEM logs** (e.g., login attempts, failed authentications).\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement:**  \n   - Check if the malicious processes are **communicating with external IPs** or **C2 servers** (via network logs or DNS queries).  \n   - Look for **file modifications** in sensitive directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows`, `C:\\Program Files`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events **requires further investigation** due to:  \n- **Unusual service creation** with obfuscated filenames.  \n- **Registry modifications** by non-standard processes.  \n- **Potential .NET-based payload** execution.  \n\n**Action:** Isolate affected systems, perform a **full malware scan**, and review **network traffic** for C2 activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. But I should check if there are any unusual patterns here. The same file is created twice, but maybe that's just a log duplication.\n\nThen there are several events from powershell.exe with tasks like Registry value set and Process accessed. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, just having these events doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. The justification would depend on other factors, like if there's a pattern of suspicious commands or unauthorized access.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe also have registry value set events. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows for managing app permissions, and svchost hosts various system services. These are normal processes, so their registry changes might be routine. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are standard applications, so their activities here don't seem suspicious.\n\nThe image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal since it's a system DLL used by Internet Explorer and other applications. Calculator.exe is just the standard calculator app, so loading urlmon.dll here is expected.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, the majority of events are from legitimate processes performing normal operations. The only thing that stands out is the repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe, but that's part of its normal function. There's no indication of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious activity. The confidence level is probably low because there's nothing here that's clearly malicious. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system and application activities, including legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe (a log shipper tool), standard process operations (powershell.exe, svchost.exe), and typical DLL loading. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
