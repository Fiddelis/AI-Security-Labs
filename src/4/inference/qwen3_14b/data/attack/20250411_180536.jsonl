{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a line where the process is None and the task is None. That might be a placeholder or an error, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed and some registry events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with other activities, it could be a red flag. The next entry is whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info. Still normal.\n\nBut wait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe creating a service called \"elemento_principal\" pointing to an executable path. That seems suspicious because sc.exe is used to manage services, and creating a new service could be part of persistence mechanisms. The command line has a long path that's not typical system directories, which might indicate malware.\n\nAnother entry shows sc.exe starting a service named \"elemento_auxiliar\". That's another service creation, which could be part of setting up backdoors. Then there are multiple Registry value set events under services.exe. Changing registry values, especially under services, could be an attempt to modify system settings or hide the malicious activity.\n\nThen there are image loaded events for mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET frameworks. However, the paths mentioned are standard, so maybe that's okay. But combined with the service creation and registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of services using sc.exe with non-standard paths, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe could indicate an attempt to install or run malicious software. Even though some activities are normal, the combination of these events, especially the service creation and registry changes, points towards potential malicious behavior. The presence of multiple registry events and service creations without clear legitimate context makes this batch interesting for further investigation. Confidence is around 0.75 because while some parts are normal, the combination of events raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: service creation via sc.exe with non-standard paths, registry modifications by services.exe, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe commands that could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious payload execution. The combination of these events suggests potential adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there are several .exe files like tarefa_logico.exe, estrutura_principal.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, and others. Some of them are loading images, like mscorlib.ni.dll and urlmon.dll. But wait, those are standard .NET and Windows system files. Loading them might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual about the paths or the processes.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and others. Registry changes can be a red flag, especially if they're modifying key settings. However, some of these processes are common, like cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which might be part of regular user activities. But if there's a pattern here, like multiple registry changes from different processes, that might be concerning.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe process is creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. That's a legitimate action if someone is installing or configuring winlogbeat, but it's also possible that this is part of a setup that's being monitored. However, there's no indication of malicious activity here yet.\n\nWait, looking again at the first few entries, the processes named tarefa_logico.exe and estrutura_principal.exe are loading image files. The names of the processes don't seem to be standard Windows processes. They might be custom applications, but the fact that they're loading system DLLs could be normal. However, if these processes are not known to the system or are part of an application that's not typically present, that could be suspicious.\n\nAnother point: there are multiple entries for Registry value set events. If these are all from different processes, maybe there's an attempt to modify multiple registry keys, which could be part of a configuration change or a potential compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple registry changes from various processes might be a sign of something unusual.\n\nThe file paths for the loaded images are all standard system paths, like C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file. The other paths are part of the .NET framework, which is also standard. So the image loading events don't seem to be pointing to anything suspicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat file creation is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user-installed software. However, if the user hasn't initiated this, it could be a sign of something else. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together: the main points are the non-standard process names and the multiple registry changes. However, the events themselves don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The processes could be part of a legitimate application, and the registry changes might be part of normal operations. However, the combination of multiple registry events and non-standard process names might warrant further investigation. But since the confidence level needs to be between 0 and 1, and the justification must be concise, I need to decide if this is enough to classify as \"INTERESTING\".\n\nI think the presence of several registry modifications from various processes, along with some non-standard process names, might be enough to flag this as interesting. However, it's not a strong indicator of an attack. So maybe a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7. But I need to be careful not to overstate it. The justification would be that there are multiple registry changes and non-standard processes, which could indicate potential malicious activity, but more data is needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from non-system processes (e.g., 'modulo_secundario.exe', 'elemento_ativo.exe') and repeated file creation by 'winlogbeat.exe' in user directories may indicate potential configuration changes or data collection activities requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
