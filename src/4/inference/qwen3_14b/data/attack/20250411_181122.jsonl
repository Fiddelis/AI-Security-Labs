The command line for one of them is \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls\\nls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password\". That looks like a script searching for passwords in various file types. That's suspicious because it's trying to find sensitive information on the system. \n\nThen, there are several events where powershell.exe loads .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but combined with the previous command, it could indicate that the PowerShell process is being used to run some malicious code or to bypass security measures.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to registry value sets and process accesses, which could be signs of persistence mechanisms or attempts to modify system settings. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be related to logging, but if it's part of a larger malicious activity, that could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there are also some benign processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe, which might just be normal user activities. But the combination of PowerShell's suspicious commands, the loaded DLLs, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple registry changes all point towards potential malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The more suspicious events there are, the higher the confidence.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process called powershell.exe loading a file from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, so maybe that's normal. But then there's another entry where powershell.exe is running a command with findstr and select-string, searching for passwords in various file types. That's a red flag because searching for passwords in files can be part of data exfiltration or credential harvesting. \n\nThen there are several entries about registry value sets, which might be normal, but when combined with the powershell activities, it could indicate some configuration changes. The Calculator.exe and svchost.exe entries seem routine. However, the repeated registry changes and the powershell commands stand out.\n\nAnother thing is that there's a file created in the user's AppData directory by PowerShell. That could be a sign of persistence or storing data. Also, the Chrome.exe entries have a lot of registry changes and DNS queries, but they might just be normal browser activity. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications and PowerShell commands searching for passwords might indicate something malicious.\n\nI should check if the PowerShell commands are part of a legitimate script or if they're being used to search for sensitive information. The use of \"select-string\" with \"-Pattern password\" suggests looking for passwords, which is suspicious. Also, the fact that the same PowerShell command is appearing multiple times might indicate repeated attempts or a script that's running multiple times.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably just a log file, but it's worth noting. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell activities and the registry changes. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch has multiple suspicious activities that, when combined, could indicate an investigation is needed.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to chrome.exe. There are several entries where chrome.exe is performing network connections, which might be normal, but the repetition could be a red flag. However, I also see that one of the events involves the loading of MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being used in an unusual way here.\n\nThen there's activity with powershell.exe creating files like objeto_logico.txt and estrutura_ativo.txt. Creating files isn't inherently malicious, but if these files are part of a larger pattern, it could be suspicious. Also, there are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, but it's often used in attacks to check user context. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's trying to delete scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack or avoiding detection. \n\nThe schtasks.exe process is involved in deleting another task named \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Scheduled tasks can be exploited by attackers to maintain persistence. The fact that multiple tasks are being deleted could indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a svchost.exe process modifying the registry. While svchost is a normal system process, registry changes here might be part of a larger attack. However, I don't see any obvious signs of data exfiltration or direct attacks. The events are more about process creation, file creation, and registry changes, which could be part of a legitimate system update or configuration change. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks and the registry modifications, raises some flags. However, without more context or indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous.

Then there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there's a command using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's odd because why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove something malicious. Also, the use of WMIC with commands to delete processes could be a red flag. \n\nThere are multiple registry value sets and process accesses, which might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or hide their activities. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various commands like net user \/del suggests attempts to delete user accounts, which could be part of covering tracks after an intrusion.\n\nThe loading of certain DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll by WMIC might be related to bypassing security mechanisms. Also, the presence of multiple process creations and registry modifications without clear legitimate purposes raises suspicion. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, using WMIC and PowerShell for process deletion, modifying registry values, and deleting user accounts points towards potential malicious activity.

So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, User Account Management, and Security Group Management. \n\nHmm, some of these commands stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that runs \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\". That looks like someone is trying to delete a user account in the domain. Then there's another cmd.exe command with \"sc delete win32times\", which is deleting a service. Those are suspicious activities because deleting user accounts and services can be part of an attack, like removing evidence or taking control of the system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes related to registry changes. The registry is a critical part of the system, so unauthorized changes there could be a red flag. The repeated use of ProcessCreate and ProcessAccess events might indicate that someone is trying to execute commands or modify the system's configuration.\n\nThe User Account Management and Security Group Management events might be normal if there's legitimate administrative activity, but combined with the deletion commands, it could be part of a larger attack. The fact that there are multiple attempts to delete users and services, along with registry modifications, suggests that an attacker might be trying to compromise the system, perhaps by removing security controls or setting up backdoors.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of legitimate activity. For instance, the whoami.exe command is a standard tool to check the current user, which might be used by administrators. But the combination with the other commands makes me think this is more than just routine checks.\n\nThe confidence level here is a bit tricky. There are enough suspicious activities to warrant investigation, but without more context like IP addresses or user details, I can't be 100% certain. Still, the presence of multiple deletion commands and registry changes is strong enough to flag this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain users (net user \/del \/domain), service deletion (sc delete win32times), and repeated registry modifications.

That's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Then there's cmd.exe, which is also normal but can be used for harmful purposes. \n\nOne of the events shows a command line with 'del' commands deleting temporary files. That could be part of cleaning up after some activity, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers do this to remove evidence. \n\nThere are several instances of 'Registry value set' events. Modifying the registry can be a red flag if it's part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nThe 'Image loaded' events mention loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate parts of the .NET framework, so that might just be normal PowerShell operations. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so maybe the system is detecting something, but the event here is just a file loaded, which is normal.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in scripts, but could be used to execute malicious code temporarily. The fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be suspicious.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is a standard tool for checking user context, which is normal. \n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but the repetition could indicate something automated or scripted. \n\nPutting it all together, while there are some suspicious elements like file deletion and registry changes, many of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. However, the combination of PowerShell activity, temporary file creation and deletion, and registry modifications might indicate a potential security incident.

Some of the tasks are like 'Pipe Created', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'Registry value set'. The 'Image loaded' event mentions 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I should check if it's suspicious. However, the path seems legitimate.\n\nThen there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but maybe the file name 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' is something to note. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nLooking at the 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe multiple times. That could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate the process, but again, it's not necessarily malicious. The repetition might be a red flag, but I need to see if there's a pattern.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a standard command to check user context, so that's probably benign. The 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' events with 'Image loaded' pointing to urlmon.dll are normal system files. The 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'svchost.exe' registry events might be part of regular system operations.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple powershell.exe events with different tasks, along with the file creation in AppData, might suggest some automated script or tool is running. The presence of 'winlogbeat' in the file path indicates a log shipping tool, which is normal for monitoring. But the repeated 'Process accessed' events could be indicative of something trying to interact with the process, perhaps for injection or monitoring.\n\nWait, but none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation. The events are mostly system-related or standard user activities. The 'MpClient.dll' is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected. The 'StartupProfileData' file might be part of PowerShell's normal operations when starting up.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't show clear evidence of a security incident.
