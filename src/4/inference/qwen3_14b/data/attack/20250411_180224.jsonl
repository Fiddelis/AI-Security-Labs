{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of activity with cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Wait, I see a command line in one of the entries: schtasks \/create \/ru system \/sc daily \/tr \"cmd \/c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\" \/tn win32times \/f. That looks like someone is setting up a scheduled task to run a PowerShell script every day. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, but the name suggests it's a non-existing script. Maybe that's a red flag because the script isn't found, but the task is still created.\n\nAnother entry shows the creation of a file at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times, which is the scheduled task directory. That's normal, but combined with the PowerShell command that uses -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policies. Also, there's a mention of svchost.exe accessing the registry multiple times. That might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and conhost.exe accessing the registry, but those might be benign. However, the repeated use of schtasks.exe to create a scheduled task with a non-existent script and the use of PowerShell with bypassed execution policies are suspicious. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory might be part of log collection, but if there's no other context, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the scheduled task creation with a non-existent script, the use of -ep bypass, and the multiple registry accesses by svchost.exe. These could indicate an attempt to execute a script that's not present, possibly a sign of a failed attack or a misconfiguration. However, the presence of these events without any clear signs of successful exploitation might make it a lower confidence. But since the task is created and the script is non-existent, it's still worth investigating. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, maybe a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: scheduled task creation with a non-existent PowerShell script path, use of 'powershell.exe -ep bypass' (common in attacks), and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe.
