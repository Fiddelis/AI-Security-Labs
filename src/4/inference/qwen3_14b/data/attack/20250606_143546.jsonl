{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, powershell.exe, backgroundTaskHost.exe, msedgewebview2.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. However, HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's a red flag. \n\nNow, the events. There are multiple 'Registry value set' events. While registry changes can be normal, if done by non-system processes, they might be suspicious. HxTsr.exe setting a registry value could be an indicator of something malicious. \n\nThen there's sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. The sppsvc.exe is related to Software Protection Platform, which is part of Windows. Creating cache.dat there might be normal, but I should check if the file path is typical. However, the other events involve svchost.exe creating multiple files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. That's where Windows Update downloads files, so that's expected during updates. But the filenames like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., are part of Windows Update components, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nThere's also a PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but if it's part of a script that's doing something unexpected, it might be an issue. However, without more context, like the script content or other events, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe Image loaded events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll are standard system DLLs. svchost.exe and other processes loading them is normal. \n\nThe presence of HxTsr.exe is concerning because it's not a known legitimate process. It's possible that this is a malware component trying to modify the registry. However, I need to check if there are other indicators. The other events don't show obvious malicious activity, like network connections or unexpected file modifications outside of typical system directories. \n\nBut since HxTsr.exe is involved in a registry change, and that's not a usual process, this might be worth investigating. The confidence isn't extremely high because there's not enough data, but the presence of an unknown process modifying the registry is suspicious. So, the classification would be interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The presence of HxTsr.exe (non-standard process) modifying registry values, combined with svchost.exe creating multiple metadata files in SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download (common in Windows Update but warrants scrutiny when paired with unusual processes), suggests potential malicious activity requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, there's svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory. That path is part of Windows Update, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. Delta patches are usually updates, but sometimes malicious software uses similar names. However, I need more context to know if this is bad.\n\nNext, MpSigStub.exe is involved. I know that MpSigStub is related to Windows Defender, so it's part of the legitimate processes. But then there are files created in the Windows Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These could be part of legitimate updates, but sometimes malware uses similar naming conventions. However, the presence of these files in the temp directory might be normal for updates.\n\nLooking further, setup.exe is creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. Some of these files like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and cookie_exporter.exe might be part of Edge's installation or updates. However, elevated_tracing_service.exe and elevation_service.exe could be suspicious if they're not part of a known legitimate process. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate process related to UWP apps, so that might be normal. The ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe could be normal, but if it's accessing sensitive files or processes, that might be a red flag. However, the event here just says \"Process accessed\" without more details.\n\nPutting it all together, there are a lot of files being created in typical system directories, which could be part of updates or installations. However, the presence of multiple file creations, especially with names that resemble patch files, and the involvement of processes like setup.exe and MpSigStub.exe might indicate an ongoing update or installation. But there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files. The events don't show any direct signs of compromise, but they do show activity that could be part of a legitimate process or potentially malicious. Since the justification needs to be concise, I think the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because there's enough activity that might warrant further investigation, even though it's not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious file creations in system directories (e.g., SoftwareDistribution, Windows Temp) and process activities (svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe) that could indicate an update\/installation or potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' entries. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Then there's 'whoami.exe', which is a legitimate tool but could be used to check user context, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nNext, the events. There are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events for PowerShell. One of the ProcessCreate events has a command line that looks suspicious. The command line includes importing a module from a path that seems a bit odd: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The use of '..' in the path might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a way to obfuscate the actual path. Also, the script name 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' sounds generic and might be a malicious script.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are .NET framework DLLs, which is normal, but others like 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' are related to Windows Defender. Loading these might be part of evasion techniques, trying to interact with or bypass security software.\n\nThere's a 'File created' and then immediately 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary script file. That could be an attempt to execute a script and then delete it to avoid leaving evidence. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for such activities.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe 'svchost.exe' events are for creating a log file and a registry change. These might be normal system activities, but without more context, they don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, suspicious command lines, loading of potentially malicious DLLs, creation and deletion of temporary files. These are all indicators of possible malicious activity. However, some of these could be legitimate, like normal PowerShell usage or updates. But the combination of the command line obfuscation, multiple image loads, and file operations in Temp directories increases the likelihood of this being a security incident.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.85. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments, including obfuscated paths and potential malicious script execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. However, svchost.exe is often used by malware to hide its activities, so I need to be cautious here.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several \"Registry value set\" events. While registry changes can be normal, especially during system updates or configuration changes, the repetition of these events might indicate something. But since they're all from svchost.exe, maybe they're part of legitimate processes. However, I should check if there's any unusual pattern.\n\nThen there are some \"File created\" events. One of the files is waasmedic.etl, which is related to Windows Update and diagnostics. Another is edbtmp.log in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which is part of the Windows Update client. These files are typically created during update operations. The path \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\\" suggests that these are part of the update download process. However, there's also a file in the DeliveryOptimization cache, which is used for peer-to-peer updates. These might be normal, but I need to check if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nWait, there's one event where the process is \"None\" for a file created in WindowsUpdate logs. That might be a system process, but it's not clear. However, the rest are svchost.exe, which is expected for system updates.\n\nNow, considering the repetition of registry changes and file creations. If these events are part of a normal update process, then they might not be interesting. However, if there's an unusual number of registry changes or files being created in non-standard locations, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, all the created files are in standard directories related to Windows Update and Delivery Optimization. The names like \"waasmedic.etl\" and \"edbtmp.log\" are typical for system logs and temporary files during updates. The svchost.exe process is legitimate here, as it's involved in managing services, including those related to updates.\n\nBut wait, there are multiple entries of \"Registry value set\" events. Could that be part of a normal update? Maybe. However, if the same registry key is being modified repeatedly, that might be suspicious. But the data provided doesn't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother point: the presence of multiple file creations in the SoftwareDistribution and DeliveryOptimization folders might be part of a legitimate update process. However, if these files are being created in large numbers or at an unusual rate, that could indicate a problem. But again, without more context, like timestamps or the rate of events, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering that all the events are related to system update processes and are associated with svchost.exe, which is a normal process, the batch might not be interesting. However, the high number of events could be a sign of something. But since the user is asking for a classification based on the entire batch, and all the activities seem to be within normal system update operations, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n\nBut I should check if there's any anomaly. For example, if the registry changes are in keys that are not typically modified during updates. But since the data doesn't specify the keys, I can't confirm that. Similarly, the file creation paths are all standard.\n\nTherefore, the batch seems to be related to normal system update activities, and thus is not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe) and files related to Windows Update, registry modifications, and temporary log files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first few entries are about the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various DLLs related to the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. That seems normal because those are standard .NET components. But then there's a shift with the 'powershell.exe' process creating a file in the AppData directory, which isn't immediately suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, the next entries show a registry value being set, but the file path is None, which might be a red flag. Then there are several entries where the process is 'None' and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', pointing to a PowerShell script located at 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That path seems unusual because it's not in the standard system directories. Also, the same script is referenced multiple times in the command line arguments of the powershell.exe process. \n\nThe command line includes importing a module from that script and executing a function called Invoke-entrada_principal, which might be a custom or malicious script. The use of $env:Temp suggests temporary file operations, which can be part of malware behavior. The repeated entries of the same command line and the remote execution task indicate potential malicious activity. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of loading .NET DLLs, executing a remote command via PowerShell, and referencing a non-standard script path with repeated execution attempts is suspicious.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard command to get the current user, so maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. The second event is Process accessed, which might be normal, but then there's a Registry value set event. Still, nothing too alarming yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a Process Create event with a command line that includes New-Service and Start-Service. The service is named \"objeto_ativo\" and points to a binary at C:\\unidade_logico...tarefa_logico.exe. That path looks a bit odd. Typically, system files are in standard directories like Program Files or AppData, but this seems custom. Creating a new service with a non-standard executable might be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. That's a bit concerning because loading DLLs from unexpected locations could indicate malicious activity. However, some of these are legitimate system DLLs, so I need to check if they're from unusual paths. For example, the path 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender...' seems legitimate, but others like 'C:\\Windows\\assembly...' are part of the .NET framework, which is normal.\n\nAnother event is a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be a sign of something malicious. The file name is a PowerShell script, which could be used for executing commands.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of a larger attack vector. Also, multiple Registry value set events for services.exe might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable, combined with the loading of various DLLs and the temporary file creation\/deletion, suggests potential malicious activity. However, some of the events are normal system processes. The key here is the combination of these events. The use of PowerShell to create a service and the unusual file paths might be indicators of a compromise. The confidence level is medium to high because while some events are benign, the overall pattern could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., creating a new service with a non-standard executable path), loading unusual DLLs, and interacting with the registry.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at the entire batch together.\n\nFirst, looking at the process entries. There's a lot of PowerShell commands being run. The first event has a command line that imports a module from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" and then tries to invoke something called \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" with an output directory set to the Temp folder. Then there's a Start-Sleep 5. That seems a bit suspicious because importing modules from paths that have \"..\\\\\" might be trying to access parent directories, which could be a way to hide the real location of the script. Also, using the Temp directory for output might be a red flag.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with the binary path pointing to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" and then starting that service. The repetition of this command across several logs (like 7 times) might indicate that this is part of an automated process or a script that's being executed multiple times, which could be normal, but combined with other activities, it might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple file events where the path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\" is being executed remotely. The task is \"Execute a Remote Command,\" which could imply that the script is being run from a remote location, which is a common tactic in attacks. The fact that this file is referenced multiple times (like 11 times) could suggest that it's a key component in whatever is happening here.\n\nPutting this all together: The logs show the execution of PowerShell scripts that import modules from specific paths, the creation of a new service that's being started repeatedly, and multiple executions of a remote command on a specific script. The repeated creation of the service and the use of a remote script execution might indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system. The paths used are somewhat obfuscated with directories that have names like \"registro_comum\" and \"registro_secundario,\" which might be part of a naming convention that's trying to blend in, but the overall pattern is suspicious.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be legitimate. For example, creating a service could be part of a normal application setup. But the combination of multiple events, the use of PowerShell for these tasks, and the remote execution of scripts are indicators that might point to malicious activity. The confidence here is high because the patterns align with common attack techniques, but I should check if there's any missing context. Since the user hasn't provided any other information, the classification would lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are executed to create and start a service ('objeto_ativo') with a binary path pointing to a suspicious executable.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them have the same structure. The \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is always \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". There are a lot of these entries—like 20 or so. Then there are a few others with different tasks like \"Logon\", \"Special Logon\", \"Security Group Management\", but those don't have the same file path repeated so much.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times. The path is a bit odd. \"unidade_logico\" translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, which might be a custom directory name. The script's name is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\"—\"componente_auxiliar\" means \"auxiliary component\". That might be a red flag because attackers often use generic names for their scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThe repetition of the same event multiple times is suspicious. Legitimate activities usually don't involve executing the same remote command so many times unless it's part of a scheduled task or a known process. However, the fact that the process is listed as \"None\" in most entries could indicate that the execution isn't tied to a legitimate process, which might be a sign of a malicious script being run without proper context.\n\nAlso, the combination of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with a PowerShell script in a non-standard path might be indicative of a command and control (C2) communication, where an attacker is trying to execute commands remotely. The lack of a process name (process: None) could mean that the script is being executed in a way that's not normally associated with a process, which is unusual.\n\nHowever, I should consider that there might be legitimate reasons for this. For example, if the system is part of a test environment or if the script is part of a legitimate remote management tool. But the repetition and the specific path make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nConfidence-wise, since there's a high number of identical events with the same file path and task, and the absence of a known process, I'd say the confidence is around 0.85.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines. Let me start by looking at the structure of each entry.\n\nEach line has a \"process\" field, which is \"None\" in most cases. Then there's a \"winlog\" field that seems to be a string representation of a dictionary. The \"task\" in winlog is either \"Execute a Remote Command\" or other things like \"Windows Update Agent\". The \"file\" field has a path, but in some cases it's \"None\".\n\nLooking at the first 15 entries, they all have the same file path: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". Then there are a few entries where the task is \"None\" or \"Windows Update Agent\" with file as None. The last two entries again go back to \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the same file path.\n\nNow, the key points here. The repetition of the same file path and task multiple times might indicate something. Executing a remote command via a PowerShell script (since .ps1 is a PowerShell script) multiple times could be suspicious. However, I should check if this is normal behavior. For example, if it's part of a legitimate process, but the fact that it's repeated so many times (like 15 times) might be a red flag. Also, the process is listed as \"None\", which might mean that the event doesn't have a process associated with it, or maybe it's a log source that doesn't track processes. \n\nAnother thing is that some entries have \"task\": \"Windows Update Agent\", which is a legitimate task. But the majority are \"Execute a Remote Command\". Also, the file path seems to be in a non-standard location. Typically, PowerShell scripts might be in Program Files or AppData, but \"unidade_logico\" translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, which might be a custom directory. That could be a sign of a malicious script being stored in an unusual location.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful. Maybe this is part of a legitimate application's logging. But the repetition of the same file and task multiple times could indicate a loop or a script that's being executed repeatedly, which might be a sign of exploitation or a script trying to maintain persistence. Also, the fact that the process is \"None\" in all these entries might mean that the logs are not capturing the process context, which could be a data collection issue, but it's also possible that the script is being executed without a clear process, which is suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is a system that's under attack, the same script being executed multiple times might be part of an attack, like trying to execute commands remotely. But without more context, like other logs or network activity, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all these entries are the same except for a few others might indicate a pattern that's worth investigating.\n\nSo, considering all this, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because there's a high frequency of the same suspicious activity (executing a remote command via a PowerShell script in an unusual location) which could indicate a potential security incident. The confidence would be around 0.85 because while it's not definitive proof, the pattern is strong enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated entries show execution of a PowerShell script (componente_auxiliar.ps1) in a non-standard path with 'Execute a Remote Command' task, suggesting potential malicious activity or persistent command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
