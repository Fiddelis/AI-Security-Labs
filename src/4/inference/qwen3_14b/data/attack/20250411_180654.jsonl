{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with the script path varying but the log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information.\n\nNow, the winlog entries mention tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be normal, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it's concerning. Also, there are file creation and deletion events, but the key thing here is the repeated use of the same script name across different paths. The fact that the scripts are being executed multiple times from different directories suggests that someone might be trying to evade detection by changing the location each time.\n\nAdditionally, there's a log entry where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', which could indicate a command being run without proper process context, another suspicious point.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign activities. For example, there are entries about Windows Defender loading DLLs and normal file creations like the PowerShell startup profile. But the repeated keystroke logging scripts are consistent and numerous, which is more indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because the pattern is too consistent and the use of keystroke logging scripts is a clear sign of potential espionage or data theft. Even though some entries are normal, the overall batch has enough suspicious elements to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from various paths with consistent logging to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not too worrying yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry might be normal, but multiple entries could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe chrome is just updating settings or extensions.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, so probably not malicious. But it's worth noting.\n\nThe next interesting part is the powershell.exe process with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The script is being run with a log path in the TEMP directory. Keystroke loggers are often used for malicious purposes, like stealing sensitive information. This script is likely capturing keystrokes and saving them to a file. That's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs. While .NET is common, the specific paths and the fact that it's loading these DLLs during PowerShell execution might be part of a larger malicious payload. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed multiple times with different paths suggests an attempt to log keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe other events with 'Provider Lifecycle' might be related to PowerShell's own operations, but combined with the keystroke logging, it points to a potential attack. The fact that the same script is referenced in different paths (elemento_secundario, entrada_padrao) might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute the same malicious script from different locations, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of keystroke logging scripts, multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry and loading .NET components, and the creation of a temporary file could be part of a larger attack. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities, especially the keystroke logging, makes this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because keystroke loggers are typically associated with malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with log paths in TEMP directory, combined with .NET DLL image loads and registry modifications, indicates potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. Wait, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path is under C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. DeliveryOptimization is a feature used for Windows updates, so the file creation here might be normal. However, sometimes malicious software can masquerade as legitimate processes. But without more context, like if there's unexpected behavior or other related events, this alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate Beats component used for log collection. The file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary configuration file during setup. If the user is installing or configuring Winlogbeat, this is normal. But if this is unexpected, maybe there's an issue. However, the event just shows a file creation, which is part of the normal operation.\n\nThe third event is about powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads directory. PowerShell is a common tool used by both admins and attackers. Creating a text file could be benign, like saving a script or data. However, if there are other events related to PowerShell executing malicious scripts or downloading files, that would be a red flag. But here, it's just a file creation. \n\nLooking at all three events together, they all involve file creation by legitimate processes in typical locations. There's no obvious sign of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or unusual command-line arguments. The processes mentioned are all legitimate, and the file paths are in areas where such files might be created as part of normal operations. \n\nHowever, the fact that all three events are file creations might be a pattern. But without additional context such as other events (like process injections, unexpected network traffic, or unauthorized access), it's hard to say. The confidence here is low because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The justification would be that the events don't show any obvious signs of compromise, but I have to consider that maybe there's more to it. However, based solely on the given data, they seem normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in expected locations (Windows system directories, user Downloads folder). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present in the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
