So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. \n\nLooking closer, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe with a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL. The command line uses WebClient's DownloadFile method. That's a common technique for downloading files, but it's often used in malicious scripts too. The URLs mentioned are from GitHub, which is legitimate, but sometimes attackers use GitHub for hosting malicious payloads. \n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate something is happening. However, the more concerning part is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file is created and then immediately deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. \n\nAlso, there are several other PowerShell processes with similar command lines downloading different files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that multiple downloads are happening, especially with different repositories, might indicate an attempt to execute multiple scripts or payloads. \n\nThe combination of these events—downloaded files, temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple PowerShell activities—could suggest a potential security incident. Even though some components are legitimate, the pattern of behavior is suspicious. The use of PowerShell for downloading files and the temporary file handling are red flags. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these might be benign, like automated scripts or legitimate administrative tasks. But the frequency and the specific actions (like the immediate deletion of the file) increase the likelihood of malicious activity. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the batch does show multiple suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75, as there's enough suspicious behavior but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes perform suspicious network downloads from GitHub URLs, followed by temporary file creation and deletion.

Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of processes like conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, and Registry object added or deleted. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a registry key under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the name \"modulo_temporario\". Then there's another reg.exe command deleting another registry key named \"pacote_auxiliar\". These deletions might be part of cleaning up after some activity, which could be suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries for powershell.exe with tasks like Process accessed and Registry value set. Also, there's a command line for powershell.exe with \"& {}\" which seems like a no-op or a placeholder, possibly indicating some obfuscation or testing. \n\nThe Image loaded event points to mscoree.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a red flag. However, since it's a standard system file, it's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: the deletion of registry keys in the Run section could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the registry modifications might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. However, some of these events could be part of normal operations, like scripts or legitimate software updates.\n\nBut the fact that there are multiple deletions in the registry, coupled with frequent process creations and accesses, might suggest an attacker trying to modify the system's configuration. The presence of whoami.exe could be checking user privileges, which is common in attacks. However, without more context like network activity or file modifications, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConfidence-wise, there are enough suspicious activities to warrant further investigation, but not enough conclusive evidence. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7. The justification would be the combination of registry deletions, multiple process accesses, and potential obfuscation with powershell.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry deletions in the Run key (potential persistence removal), frequent PowerShell and cmd.exe activity, and suspicious process access events suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry and looking for any suspicious patterns.\n\nFirst, there's a PowerShell.exe creating a file called entrada_base.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a normal user activity, maybe someone just downloaded a file. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That's part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. No issues there.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. Maybe they're setting up a new instance. Still okay.\n\nThen multiple entries of PowerShell.exe doing registry value sets and process accesses. Registry changes can be normal, but if it's done by PowerShell, maybe it's part of a script. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But multiple instances might be a red flag.\n\nThere's a calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a standard app, and urlmon.dll is part of Windows. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, the user runs whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info. That's normal.\n\nThe critical part comes with the cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\" using SCHTASKS. Deleting a scheduled task might be suspicious, especially if the task name is something like \"spawn,\" which could be a hint. But why delete it? Maybe the user was trying to remove something they created, but why would they do that? Also, the command is run with \/c to execute a command and then exit. That's common in scripts.\n\nThen there's another entry for schtasks.exe being created. Scheduled tasks can be used for legitimate purposes, but if they're being manipulated, that's a concern. However, the log shows the deletion of the task, not creation. Maybe the attacker was trying to remove evidence.\n\nAlso, multiple PowerShell.exe instances accessing processes and modifying the registry. If this is part of a larger sequence, like creating a scheduled task, modifying registry keys, and then deleting the task, that could be part of a malicious activity. But in the logs provided, the only scheduled task action is the deletion. The user might be cleaning up after creating a task, but there's no evidence of the task being created here.\n\nWait, the user ran SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F. So they're deleting a task named \"spawn.\" If this task was previously created by an attacker to perform malicious actions, deleting it would be part of covering tracks. However, the logs don't show the creation of that task. So maybe this is just a user managing their own tasks. But the name \"spawn\" is a bit odd. It's a common name in malware for spawning processes. That might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple PowerShell.exe activities. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. However, without seeing actual malicious commands (like downloading payloads or executing scripts), it's hard to confirm. The logs don't show the content of the PowerShell commands, just the process names and events.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses could indicate that some configuration changes are happening. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the deletion of a scheduled task named \"spawn\" and the multiple PowerShell activities. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or unauthorized access, it might not be enough to classify as interesting. But the name \"spawn\" and the deletion of a task could be part of a larger attack. The confidence here is a bit low because the logs don't show the full picture. Maybe the user is just doing normal administrative tasks, but the combination of events might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities, registry modifications, and deletion of a scheduled task named 'spawn' (a suspicious name often associated with malicious activity) indicate potential lateral movement or cleanup efforts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. The command lines in some of the entries are using the WebClient object to download files from GitHub. The URLs are all pointing to raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for downloading files, but the filenames are LICENSE.txt. That's a bit odd because LICENSE files are usually just text files and not malicious. However, the fact that they're being downloaded to the TEMP directory might be a red flag. \n\nWait, but why would someone download a LICENSE file multiple times? Maybe they're trying to execute something else. Let me check the command lines again. The syntax looks like a PowerShell one-liner that downloads a file. The paths where they're being saved are in the TEMP directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. But again, LICENSE files are usually benign. However, the repetition of similar commands with different URLs might indicate a pattern. \n\nThen there's an entry where a file is created in the Downloads folder: 'elemento_padrao.txt'. But that's a normal file creation event. The other events involve chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. That could be normal if it's part of an extension or update, but repeated registry changes might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if it's part of a monitoring setup. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events downloading files from GitHub might still be worth investigating. \n\nBut wait, the main thing here is that all these PowerShell commands are downloading LICENSE.txt files. That seems unusual because LICENSE files are typically not executed. However, if the attacker is using a GitHub repository to host malicious code disguised as a LICENSE file, that could be a trick. But the URLs are from legitimate sources (GitHub), which might make it harder for the system to flag them as malicious. \n\nAlso, the task names in the winlog entries are things like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', which might be part of normal system operations. However, when combined with multiple PowerShell downloads, it could indicate someone trying to execute scripts or download payloads. \n\nBut the problem is that the command lines are all about downloading LICENSE.txt, which are legitimate files. Unless there's a hidden payload in those files, but the logs don't show any execution of those files. The files are just being downloaded. So maybe this is just someone using PowerShell to download license files for some project. \n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple such events with different GitHub repositories might be a sign of automated activity. Maybe the user is trying to download multiple files as part of a larger operation. But without seeing the content of the downloaded files or any execution of them, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother point is the 'File created' event for the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. If that file is being created in a startup location, that could be a sign of persistence. \n\nBut again, the justification for classification depends on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the system normally has PowerShell scripts downloading files from GitHub, then this might be normal. However, if this is unusual, then it's worth looking into. \n\nConsidering all that, the presence of multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, even if they're LICENSE files, might be a red flag. Especially if they are being saved to temporary directories and there are other file creation events in startup locations. The repetition of similar commands with different URLs could indicate a pattern of activity that's not typical. \n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to warrant an investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because the files are LICENSE.txt, but the combination of multiple downloads and other events might be suspicious.

That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe not suspicious. However, there's a FileCreate event where a temporary script file is created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. \n\nCreating and deleting a file in Temp might be part of normal operations, but when combined with multiple PowerShell processes and registry changes, it could indicate something. The user is using PowerShell, which is common, but the combination of creating a script file, then deleting it quickly might be a sign of an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, there are several entries with the command_line 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Maybe that's a red herring or part of some obfuscation. The Provider Lifecycle events might be related to logging or monitoring tools, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nHowever, the fact that there's a FileCreate followed by a FileDelete on a script file in Temp could be a sign of an attacker trying to run a script and then cleaning up.

These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. However, there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1, which is then deleted.

The command lines for some processes are just 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like a no-op, maybe a test or a benign command. However, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities.

The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a legitimate installation or configuration process.\n\nPutting this all together, the main points of interest are the temporary script file creation and deletion, and the multiple registry modifications. However, none of the events clearly indicate a security breach. The .NET image loads are normal, and the other processes don't show obvious malicious intent. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some suspicious activities, they could also be part of normal system operations or benign scripts.

Chrome.exe also has multiple registry value sets. But why so many from Chrome? Maybe it's just normal operations, but the repetition could be a red flag.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a line where powershell.exe is running a command to remove a file named \"objeto_principal.zip\" from the TEMP directory. That's interesting because deleting a file, especially from a temporary directory, might be part of cleaning up after an attack. But is that necessarily malicious? Maybe, but I need more context.\n\nAnother entry shows the loading of \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender's directory. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably normal.

Deleting these files might be part of cleaning up after an operation, which could be normal or could be an attempt to remove evidence. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests they want to ensure the files are deleted without errors, which might be a bit suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Loaded events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender.

However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are normal for checking user context, so that's probably benign.\n\nThe key points are the multiple attempts to delete specific files in the TEMP directory using PowerShell. The filenames like \"registro_auxiliar.txt\" and others don't immediately ring a bell as standard files. However, deleting them might be part of a cleanup process. But why so many different files? It could be a red flag if these files are related to malicious activities, like removing evidence.\n\nBut wait, the classification should be based on whether the batch is interesting.

However, the repetition of such commands might indicate an automated process that's not standard. Alternatively, it could be part of a malicious payload trying to remove logs or other traces.\n\nAnother angle: the task in winlog is \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" for the PowerShell events. These tasks are part of the Windows Event Log system. If the lifecycle tasks are being triggered by these PowerShell commands, maybe there's an issue with how the events are being logged, but that's more of a technicality.\n\nThe other events involving chrome.exe and registry changes might not be directly related unless there's a connection.

The first few entries show that PowerShell is loading various DLLs from the .NET Framework, like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But then there's an entry where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Then, there are several events where PowerShell deletes files in the Temp directory, like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. \n\nWait, the creation and deletion of these zip files might be suspicious. The file is created and then immediately deleted, which could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily. Also, the names of the files are generic and might be used to avoid detection. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields. These commands are deleting various zip files from the Temp directory. The fact that there are so many deletions could indicate that the user is cleaning up after some activity, maybe after extracting or executing a script. \n\nBut then I see that the same PowerShell process is also loading DLLs from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might be normal, but sometimes attackers might load their own DLLs in place of legitimate ones, but in this case, the paths seem correct. \n\nHowever, the combination of creating a script file, then deleting it, along with multiple deletions of zip files, might be part of a larger operation. The fact that the script is being run and then cleaned up could be an attempt to hide evidence.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about processes being accessed or created. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe' entries. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate command that shows user information, but it's common in both benign and malicious activities. However, the repetition here might be a red flag. Then, there's an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs, but if it's creating files in unexpected locations, that might be suspicious. Also, there's a 'pacote_ativo.txt' file created by PowerShell. The name doesn't ring a bell, but maybe it's a placeholder or something related to malware. \n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could indicate that someone is trying to access processes, possibly for reconnaissance. The 'whoami.exe' being run multiple times might be part of checking user privileges. The file creation by winlogbeat is in a Downloads folder, which is a common place for downloads but might be normal if the user is installing software. However, the 'pacote_ativo.txt' is a bit odd. The name 'pacote_ativo' translates to 'active package' in Portuguese, which might be a clue, but I'm not sure. \n\nI should check if there's any pattern of suspicious activity. The fact that PowerShell is being used multiple times could be part of a script, which isn't inherently bad, but in combination with other events, it might be. The presence of both legitimate tools and potential malicious file names might suggest something. However, without more context, like network activity or other indicators, it's hard to say. But the repetition of the same processes and the creation of a .txt file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' might be enough to flag this as interesting. \n\nConfidence-wise, I think it's a medium to high chance. The justification would be the repeated PowerShell access and the creation of an unusual file. However, since there's no direct evidence of a threat, maybe it's not high. But the combination of events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses combined with creation of a suspicious file ('pacote_ativo.txt') and repeated 'whoami.exe' executions may indicate reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
