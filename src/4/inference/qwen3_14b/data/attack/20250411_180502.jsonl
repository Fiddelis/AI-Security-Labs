{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. So, first, looking at the events. There's a lot of activity from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe events.\n\nHmm, the powershell.exe entries have various tasks like Registry value set, Process Create, Image Loaded, File created and deleted. One of them has a command line that starts a process with a batch file. The paths here are a bit suspicious. They have things like \"..\\..\" which might be trying to navigate up directories. But wait, the paths are all under different folders, like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\". Maybe that's just part of the legitimate script paths? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe if there's an unexpected DLL, but in this case, they're all standard ones like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That could be a red flag because sometimes malware creates temporary files and deletes them quickly to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of Start-Process in the command lines. PowerShell scripts using Start-Process are common, but if they're executing batch files from various paths, maybe that's part of a larger script or malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the presence of multiple registry events and process creations might indicate some automated tasks or scripts running.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the batch should be analyzed as a whole. So combining all these events: Chrome's normal activity, PowerShell doing legitimate tasks but with some suspicious file operations and paths. The fact that the same PowerShell process is creating and deleting files in Temp could be benign, like a script that's self-cleaning. However, the multiple ImageLoads and registry changes might be part of a larger attack. But I don't see any obvious malicious indicators like connecting to suspicious IPs, downloading files, or executing unknown binaries. The events are all system-related and might be part of normal operations or legitimate scripts. However, the combination of these events could be worth investigating further to confirm if they're part of a larger pattern or if there's something hidden. So, I think this is a medium risk and should be marked as interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe**: DNS queries and network connections are typical for a browser.\n- **PowerShell.exe**: Loading standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and registry modifications are common in legitimate scripts.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Folder**:\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) and immediately deletes it. While this could be benign (e.g., self-cleaning scripts), it may also indicate obfuscation or evasion tactics.\n\n2. **Repetitive `Start-Process` Commands**:\n   - PowerShell repeatedly executes batch files via `Start-Process` with paths containing `..\\..`, which could be an attempt to obscure the true location of the scripts. This pattern is often seen in malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Unusual Path Structures**:\n   - The batch files are launched from paths like `C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\...`, which may suggest tampering with directory structures or attempts to bypass security checks.\n\n4. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**:\n   - PowerShell processes are linked to \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events, which could indicate automated or scripted operations, possibly involving external tools or payloads.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile no direct evidence of malware is present, the combination of **suspicious file operations**, **obfuscated paths**, and **repetitive process creation** raises concerns. These patterns are consistent with **legitimate administrative tasks** but could also signal **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration). Further analysis (e.g., checking the contents of the deleted temp file, monitoring network traffic, or inspecting the batch files) is recommended to confirm intent.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting** â€“ warrants deeper investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's Calculator.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. That's normal, but powershell.exe is often used in attacks. Then, there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe, which might be okay. But then, looking at the file paths, one of the Image loaded events points to a dll in the Windows Defender directory. That seems legitimate, but maybe there's something else.\n\nThen, chrome.exe has several registry events. A lot of registry changes could be a red flag, especially if they're all from chrome. But wait, there's a command line in one of the processes: powershell.exe executing a script from a path that includes \"..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" might indicate moving up directories, which could be a sign of trying to access files outside the intended path. That's suspicious.\n\nAnother entry shows cmd.exe running a script from \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The path names here are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but the presence of multiple scripts being executed from various locations could be concerning. Also, there's a File created event for powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. That's not necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the image loads, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That's normal. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or inject code.\n\nThe svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory is probably legitimate, but the other file creation in the user's Downloads folder by powershell.exe could be part of data exfiltration or script execution.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes, execution of scripts from possibly malicious paths, and process accesses. The use of powershell.exe multiple times with command lines that include scripts from non-standard locations could indicate a potential security threat. Even though some events are normal (like chrome loading defender dlls), the combination of these events might be worth investigating further. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the combination of suspicious registry changes, script executions from unusual paths, and multiple process accesses that could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scripts from non-standard paths (e.g., '..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat'), excessive registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and potential command-line injection attempts. These patterns may indicate adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a batch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there are seven entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with file as None. Chrome modifying the registry might be normal, but doing it multiple times could be suspicious. However, without more context, like specific registry keys or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's just regular updates or extensions.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation when setting up. But the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, if the user is manually configuring it, that's normal.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating \"elemento_base.txt\" in the same Downloads folder. PowerShell creating files isn't inherently malicious, but the name is generic. If this is part of a script or user activity, it's normal. However, if there's no clear reason for the file's creation, it might be worth looking into.\n\nNow, considering all together: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be benign if related to its own operations. The winlogbeat file creation seems like part of setup. The powershell file might be user-generated. There's no obvious malicious activity here, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or known malicious hashes. The confidence is low because there's no clear indication of a security incident. So, classification is NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process activity (chrome.exe registry modifications, winlogbeat configuration file creation, and user-initiated file creation via PowerShell). No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
