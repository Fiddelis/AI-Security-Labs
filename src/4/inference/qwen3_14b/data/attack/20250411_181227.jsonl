So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar each time, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, triggering at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. The tasks are named things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. \n\nWait, calc.exe is usually a benign calculator, but here it's being scheduled to run at logon with admin rights. That's suspicious. Creating multiple scheduled tasks with the same pattern might indicate an attempt to persist access or execute malicious code under admin privileges. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for ImageLoad events pointing to .NET DLLs. While .NET components are common, the combination with PowerShell and scheduled tasks could be part of a larger attack. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times with different task names might be an attempt to evade detection by varying the task names.\n\nThe other events involve chrome.exe and some registry changes, but the main focus here is on the PowerShell activities. The use of Register-ScheduledTask with admin rights is a red flag. Even though calc.exe isn't harmful on its own, the method and context here are concerning. \n\nI should check if there's any indication of malicious payloads. The command lines don't show obvious malware, but the persistence mechanism (scheduled tasks) and the elevation of privileges (RunLevel Highest) are indicators of potential compromise. \n\nConsidering all events together, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin privileges using PowerShell is a strong sign of something malicious. The confidence here would be high, maybe around 0.9, because the pattern is consistent and the actions are suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Malicious Activity\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges to execute calc.exe at logon. This pattern is commonly used for persistence and privilege escalation in attacks. The repeated creation of similar tasks with different names suggests evasion tactics.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look at the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, but maybe that's a red herring. Then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp folder. That could be normal, but sometimes malicious scripts use Temp folders to execute and then clean up. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be normal, but could also be part of something malicious. Then there's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon, with the highest privileges for administrators. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions might be an attempt to maintain persistent access. \n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. That might be normal if Chrome is updating its settings, but repeated entries could indicate something else. However, the majority of the logs are about Chrome and PowerShell. \n\nWait, but there are also a bunch of entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks, but the process is listed as \"None\". That could be a sign of something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited, or maybe a false positive. However, if the process is missing, that might be an indicator of a compromise, especially if those events are coming from a legitimate process that's being manipulated. \n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activity involving scheduled tasks with admin rights is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are from Chrome and the Windows Defender, the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges is a red flag. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries without a process might also be significant. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful. Some of these could be false positives. For example, Windows Defender's own processes might be logged, and scheduled tasks could be part of legitimate software. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with admin rights, using PowerShell, and the presence of multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events (even if process is None) raises the suspicion. \n\nThe confidence level might be around 0.75 because there are multiple suspicious events, but not enough to be certain. However, the presence of the scheduled task with high privileges and the remote command executions are enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including scheduled task creation with administrative privileges and potential file manipulation in temporary directories. The presence of repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events without associated processes also raises concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. However, taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, which is normal. Not sure yet, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Setting registry values could be normal, but if done in a pattern or with certain keys, it might be a sign of something. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys, so it's hard to tell. But multiple events might indicate something, but not certain.\n\nNext, there's a file created by svchost.exe at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the Tasks directory is typically used by Task Scheduler. Creating a file there might be normal, but \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell. Maybe a typo or a suspicious filename? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an event with process None executing a remote command. That's odd. If the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process, but executing a remote command without a known process could be a red flag. Maybe a lateral movement or remote access attempt?\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in user directories like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and some downloaded files. Creating files in PowerShell's startup directory might be normal, but if there's unexpected content, it could be malicious. Also, there are entries for winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating config files might be normal, but maybe the user is configuring it, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThere are a bunch of chrome.exe events, mostly registry value sets and image loads. Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate DLLs for antivirus and security features. So that's probably normal.\n\nLooking again at the remote command execution events with process None. That's a bit concerning because it's unclear what's executing the command. It might be a sign of a vulnerability exploit where the process isn't properly identified.\n\nAlso, the repeated registry changes by svchost and chrome.exe might be part of normal operations, but combined with the remote command and file creations, it could indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, the majority of events seem to be normal system activities. The key points are the remote command execution without a process and the file creations in certain directories. But without more context, like the registry keys being modified or the content of the files created, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConfidence-wise, there are some suspicious elements, but they might be benign. The classification might be \"interesting\" because of the remote command and possible file creations, but the confidence isn't extremely high because some events are normal. Maybe around 0.6?\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including 'Execute a Remote Command' with no associated process, 'svchost.exe' modifying registry values repeatedly, and creation of files in system directories (e.g., 'Tasks\\\\unidade_comum'). These could indicate unauthorized access or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
