The file paths are all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames are officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes.

If they're part of a legitimate Office package, maybe they're resources, but the repetition is still suspicious.\n\nThen there's one event where the process is null and the task is Security Group Management. That might be a separate event, but not directly related to the others. Also, there's an entry for winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the rest of the events are about SDXHelper.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of events are SDXHelper creating multiple JS files in a specific directory with repetitive entries. While SDXHelper is legitimate, the repetition and the nature of the files might indicate something unusual.

The files are named with hashes and have the .js extension. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, but maybe that's part of a normal process. \n\nThen there are a couple of ImageLoad events for BitsProxy.dll by svchost.exe and chrome.exe. BitsProxy.dll is a legitimate Windows component, so those might be normal. However, the repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe raises a flag. \n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that it's part of a legitimate application, but given the context of the files being created in the Office SolutionPackages folder, maybe it's related to some Office add-in or update. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with different hashes could be suspicious. If this is part of a legitimate update, there might be documentation, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the path: the files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. That might be part of an offline installation or caching, but again, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be a red flag. Also, the names of the JavaScript files seem to be minified, which is common for web resources, but in an Office context, that's less typical. \n\nHowever, there's no evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual process behavior, network connections, or privilege escalations. The only thing that stands out is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, but without additional context, it's hard to classify this as definitely malicious. \n\nConsidering all this, the classification might be interesting because of the unusual file creation pattern, but the confidence isn't extremely high.

Most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. Then there are a couple of events where chrome.exe is setting registry values.\n\nFirst, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in installing or updating add-ins. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder... Hmm, the path is under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a normal place for Office to store package resources. However, the fact that there are so many files created with different hashes might be suspicious. Are these expected? Maybe during an update, but usually, such files would be part of a known package. If they're being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a trusted process, maybe it's just part of a normal operation. But the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could indicate something else. Wait, but looking at the file paths, they all have the same directory structure except for the hash part. So maybe each of these is a different version of the same file, being deployed as part of an update or installation. That could be normal.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe events. Chrome setting registry values. That's a bit odd. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe in some cases. However, if there's no other context, like a known legitimate reason, this could be a red flag. But the logs don't show any malicious activity here, just the registry value being set. Without more info, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are two separate events for chrome.exe doing this might be a sign of something. But again, maybe it's just a normal action.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of events are from SDXHelper.exe creating files in a legitimate directory. The repetition might be normal if it's part of a package deployment. However, the presence of chrome.exe modifying the registry is a bit out of place. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or any other suspicious activity, it's hard to say. The confidence here is a bit low because the SDXHelper activity could be legitimate, but the chrome.exe events add some uncertainty. However, since the user is asking for whether the batch is interesting, and the majority is from a trusted process, maybe it's not interesting. Unless the combination of these events is suspicious. But I don't see a clear attack vector here. The files are in a legitimate location, and the process is trusted. The chrome.exe events alone might not be enough to classify this as interesting. So, maybe the classification is NOT INTERESTING with low confidence. But wait, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes might be a sign of something. Maybe the hashes are unique to each file, but if they're all being created by SDXHelper.exe, it's probably part of a normal update.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash.\n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that the same process is creating the same files repeatedly. Each entry has the same process name and the same file paths. That's a bit suspicious. Usually, if a process is creating files, especially multiple times, there might be some reason for that. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating these files?\n\nNow, the file paths are all within the Microsoft Office directory. That's a legitimate place for Office to store some resources, but the fact that these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe might be a red flag. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Office Deployment Tool. However, it's usually involved in installation or updates, not creating JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder.\n\nWait, the SolutionPackages folder is typically used for storing solution packages, which are part of Office add-ins or customizations. But the files here are named like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\", which sounds like it's related to the AI Copilot feature in Office. However, the presence of multiple files with different hash values might indicate that they're different versions or parts of a larger package. But why would they be created multiple times? That's not normal behavior for a legitimate process.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition. Each file is being created multiple times, with the same process and same path. That's not typical. Legitimate processes usually don't create the same file multiple times unless it's part of a specific operation, like a reinstall or an update. But even then, the logs would probably show different timestamps or different processes involved.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these events are related to the same process and same directory might indicate that something is trying to inject or modify the Office environment. Maybe an attacker is using SDXHelper.exe as a vector to drop malicious files. However, without more information, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut wait, maybe this is a false positive. If the user is installing or updating Office, maybe these files are part of that process. But the repetition of the same file creation events might not align with that. Also, the hash values in the filenames are different each time, which could be normal if they're different files, but the same file being created multiple times would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a benign activity. If the system is part of a larger deployment or customization, the SDXHelper.exe might be generating these files as part of a legitimate process. However, the lack of other context makes it hard to determine. But given that all the events are the same and repetitive, it's more likely to be suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: repeated creation of the same files by the same process in a non-standard location (even if it's within Office directories) could indicate a potential security issue. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a possibility of a legitimate scenario, but the repetition and the nature of the files make it worth investigating.

Then there's EXCEL.EXE creating a temp Excel file and loading some DLLs. The Zone.Identifier streams are normal for marking files as coming from the internet. The image loads are standard system DLLs. But the main thing here is the numerous file creations by SDXHelper.exe. If these files are part of a legitimate Office package, it might be okay, but if they're being generated in an unusual way or in large quantities, it could indicate something malicious. However, without more context like unexpected network activity or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say. The classification here is tricky. The logs don't show obvious malicious activity, but the repeated file creation might warrant further investigation. So maybe \"INTERESTING\" with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple SDXHelper.exe processes creating numerous localized UI string files in Microsoft Office directories, which could indicate legitimate localization activities or potential malicious payload delivery through Office add-ins.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or package. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office solutions. But then there are a couple of other events: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll, a registry event from chrome.exe, Excel opening a spreadsheet, and another file created by SDXHelper.exe in a different package directory.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Office Deployment Tool or some kind of helper for installing or managing Office solutions. However, the fact that multiple JavaScript files are being created in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal if someone is deploying an add-in. But I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. That might be part of a legitimate package, but the repetition of similar file names with different hashes could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the presence of multiple FileCreate events from SDXHelper.exe might be part of a normal installation process.\n\nThen there's the Chrome-related events. Loading urlmon.dll is normal, as that's part of Internet Explorer's URL handling, and Chrome might use it. The registry event from Chrome could be normal too, but without knowing what registry key was modified, it's hard to tell. The Excel process opening a spreadsheet seems benign unless the file is malicious, but there's no indication here.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple entries for the same files being created, but that might just be multiple instances of the same process creating the same files. However, the presence of a new file in a different package directory (30cca4340ab99b717e6ca1cf14f75d78) might be a red flag if it's unexpected. But again, without knowing the context of the user's environment, it's hard to say.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't show any obvious signs of malware or malicious activity. They seem to be part of normal Office operations, possibly installing or updating an add-in. However, the repetition of file creation events and the use of SDXHelper.exe could be something to investigate further, especially if the user is not expecting these files to be created. But since the classification is based on whether it's interesting for investigation, and there's no clear malicious activity here, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING.\" But I should check if there's any other angle.\n\nWait, but the justification needs to be concise. The main points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories, which could be normal or part of a legitimate process. However, the absence of other suspicious activities (like network connections, unusual processes, or known malicious hashes) makes it less likely to be a security incident. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe or the files involved. Since the user hasn't provided any additional context, the confidence would be moderate, maybe around 0.4, because there's some unusual activity but not enough to confirm a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directories, which is consistent with legitimate Office add-in deployment behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a file created by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file is a JavaScript file. Hmm, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? But creating a JavaScript file in that location might be normal, or maybe not. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are all legitimate system DLLs that Excel might need. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set event from svchost.exe. That's a common process, but multiple registry changes could be a red flag. However, svchost is a host process for multiple services, so it's normal to have registry activity. But multiple entries here might be worth noting.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE creates a file named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx in the Downloads folder. That's a temporary file created by Excel when you save a document. Then it's deleted. That seems normal, like when you close a file, Excel might create a temporary file and delete it. But maybe if there's a pattern here?\n\nThere are multiple registry events from svchost.exe again. Maybe some kind of configuration changes? But without more context, hard to tell.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE creates a pipe, which is used for inter-process communication. That's normal for Excel to communicate with other processes or services.\n\nAnother ImageLoad event for combase.dll, which is part of the Windows COM library. Again, normal.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe events again. The first one was creating a JavaScript file in the SolutionPackages directory. The second event is another file created by SDXHelper.exe in a similar path. The file names are different but similar structure. Maybe these are legitimate resources for Office solutions. However, sometimes malicious software can use similar paths to hide files. But SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, so maybe not.\n\nWait, but there are two entries for the same file path? Wait, no, looking again, the first SDXHelper event is for a file in 30cca4340ab99b71... and the second is in 36f79ca6696ef135... So different directories. That might be normal if Office is downloading different packages. But maybe the user is concerned about unexpected files being created.\n\nAnother thing is that the user has a lot of ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs. But the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost.exe might be a sign of something. However, svchost is a common process and can trigger registry changes as part of normal operations.\n\nAlso, the temporary file created and deleted by Excel is normal. But the fact that there's a creation and deletion might be part of normal operation. Unless there's a pattern of files being created and deleted rapidly, but in this case, it's just one instance.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. All the processes involved (EXCEL.EXE, svchost.exe, SDXHelper.exe) are legitimate. The files created are in expected directories for Office solutions, and the DLLs loaded are standard. The registry changes by svchost are normal. However, the repeated registry events might be a bit concerning, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple file creates by SDXHelper.exe might be normal as part of Office's package management.\n\nBut maybe the user is expecting something more. However, based on the information given, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no suspicious activity detected in the logs provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (EXCEL.EXE, svchost.exe, SDXHelper.exe) loading standard system DLLs or creating temporary files in expected locations (e.g., Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, Downloads).

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration process. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. These files have names like fabric_..., bn-in-ui-strings-json, and bundle_... Those look like they could be part of Office add-ins or language packs. But why so many duplicates? The same file paths are repeated, which might indicate that the process is writing the same file multiple times, which isn't typical. \n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE. Registry changes can be normal, but when combined with the file creations, it might be part of a larger activity. However, all the processes mentioned (winlogbeat, SDXHelper, Explorer, Excel) are legitimate applications. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, SDXHelper might be related to Office solutions, and Excel is a common application. \n\nThe key point here is whether these activities are part of normal operations or something suspicious. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper could be normal if it's part of an update or installation, but the same file being created multiple times might be a red flag. However, without more context like unusual process behavior, network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to say. The classification as \"NOT INTERESTING\" might be because all the processes are legitimate and the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity.

There are multiple entries for different JavaScript files. Then there are a few DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe isn't a common process I recognize. Usually, Office-related processes might be part of legitimate software, but creating multiple files in the SolutionPackages directory could be suspicious.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, most of the events are from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are 28 of these, all the same. Then there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\", and finally two events from SDXHelper.exe about a file being created in a specific path.\n\nHmm. Excel normally doesn't modify the registry much, especially if it's just setting values repeatedly. But wait, the registry events here are all the same. Maybe that's normal? Or maybe it's a sign of something malicious. But then, the SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks like part of Microsoft Office's local storage for add-ins or solutions. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Office, but creating files there might be normal during installation or updates.\n\nBut why so many registry events from Excel? If it's a legitimate use case, maybe Excel is doing some configuration changes. However, if it's a lot of repeated registry changes, that could be suspicious. However, the justification for being interesting would need to be based on anomalies.

However, if the file is being created in a user's AppData folder, that's typical for temporary or user-specific data. But the presence of multiple registry changes from Excel might be unrelated. However, combining the two: maybe the registry changes are part of a configuration that allows the SDXHelper to perform actions, but I don't see a direct link here.\n\nAlternatively, if the registry changes are all the same, maybe they are benign. But if they are different, that's more suspicious. But in this case, the events are identical. So maybe they are part of a normal process.

However, the path is within the user's AppData, which is a common location for both legitimate and malicious files. \n\nCombining these events: multiple registry changes by Excel and a suspicious file creation by SDXHelper. But since the SDXHelper is part of Office, maybe it's just part of normal operations. However, the repetition of registry events might indicate something's wrong. But without seeing the actual registry keys being modified or more context on the file's content, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe confidence isn't super high because there's not enough data. But the combination of unusual file creation and repeated registry changes might warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: SDXHelper.exe creating a file with a hash-based name in a non-standard Office directory, and EXCEL.EXE repeatedly modifying registry values (potentially indicative of malicious activity or unusual behavior).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the first thing I notice is that there are a bunch of events related to Excel.EXE modifying the registry. There are seven entries where the task is \"Registry value set\" under the RegistryEvent rule. Now, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry that much, especially if it's just setting values repeatedly. That might be normal if someone is using Excel in a way that interacts with the registry, but it's a bit suspicious.\n\nThen, there are several entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files. These files are in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names look like they're related to language-specific UI strings, like kok-in-ui-strings-json and others. The paths are all within the user's AppData folder, which is common for temporary files, but the repetition here is interesting. Also, the same files are being created multiple times, which might indicate some kind of loop or automated process.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office add-in or some kind of helper tool, but the fact that it's creating so many files in the SolutionPackages directory might be a red flag. Office solutions sometimes use such directories, but the high number of files and the specific naming could be indicative of something like a malicious payload being injected or a component of a malware that's trying to persist or communicate.\n\nThe combination of Excel.EXE modifying the registry and SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in a non-standard way could be part of a larger attack. Maybe the registry changes are configuring something that allows SDXHelper.exe to run, and the files are part of the payload. However, without more context, like network activity or other processes, it's a bit hard to say. But given the repetitive nature of the events and the non-standard processes involved, this seems worth investigating further. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a chance it's a legitimate but unusual activity, but the patterns here lean towards being interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE and repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in Office SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate malicious activity or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided three log entries, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each entry is about a file being created under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and some hashes.\n\nFirst, I need to check if these files are legitimate. The path is in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages folder. That's a known location for Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames include \"OfflineFiles\" and \"ui-strings-json\", which might be part of localization files for an Office add-on. The fact that three entries are the same file (ne-np-ui-strings...) might be a duplication, but maybe it's just multiple events for the same file creation.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of the Office Deployment Tool, used for installing or updating Office. So creating files in that directory is normal. However, the presence of multiple file creations could be part of a normal update process. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity. The filenames have hashes in them, which is typical for uniquely identifying files. No unusual characters or paths that look like common malicious directories. The user is fiddelis, which might be a legitimate user.\n\nNo other processes are mentioned, and all events are related to file creation. Since all are legitimate Office-related activities, the classification is probably not interesting. Unless there's a pattern I'm missing, like excessive file creation or unexpected files. But with three entries, it's within normal bounds. So the justification would be that these are normal Office update activities by a legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (Office Deployment Tool) in the expected Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The file names look like they might be localization files (like mi-nz-ui-strings, mk-mk-ui-strings, etc.), which are probably part of some software package. There's also a mention of EXCEL.EXE setting a registry value, but that's just one event.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that it's part of a legitimate application, but the fact that it's creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages folder raises a flag. Typically, Office SolutionPackages might be related to add-ins or custom solutions. However, the repetition of file creation with different language codes (like en-us, mi-nz, mk-mk, etc.) could indicate that this is part of a legitimate software deployment, maybe a plugin or an update. \n\nBut wait, why are there so many files being created? Each entry has the same process name, SDXHelper.exe, and they're all in the same directory structure. That could be normal if it's installing multiple language packs, but I need to check if there's any suspicious activity. The other event with EXCEL.EXE modifying the registry might be unrelated, but it's worth noting. \n\nHowever, there's no indication of malicious activity here. The files are being created in a legitimate Office directory, and the process name, while not standard, isn't necessarily malicious. Without more context, like unusual network activity, unexpected parent processes, or known malicious hashes, it's hard to classify this as suspicious. \n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process and is creating a large number of files in a non-standard way, that might be concerning. But given the information here, the files seem to be part of a package installation. The confidence level is moderate because there's not enough data to confirm malicious intent, but the presence of multiple file creations by a non-standard process is noteworthy. \n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities, while unusual, don't present clear signs of malicious behavior. The justification would be that the events are related to file creation by a process in a legitimate Office directory, possibly part of a software deployment. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's some unusual activity but not enough to confirm a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show SDXHelper.exe creating localization files in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which appears to be part of a legitimate software deployment process.
