{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's part of the winlogbeat installation, maybe a configuration file. Not suspicious yet. Then, powershell.exe created a file called teste.ps1. That's a PowerShell script, which could be benign or malicious. But just creating a script isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there's another event from winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file again. Maybe it's just part of the setup process. Then, powershell.exe has a registry value set. Not sure yet. The next event is a process creation with powershell.exe running the teste.ps1 script with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass. That's a red flag because bypassing the execution policy can allow scripts to run without proper restrictions.\n\nThen there are multiple image load events for PowerShell, which is normal since it's a .NET application. But then there's an image load for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but maybe there's something else. \n\nLooking further, the PowerShell process creates a temporary script file in AppData\\Local\\Temp, then deletes it. That's common for scripts to create temporary files, but deleting them afterward could be an attempt to cover tracks. Also, creating a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file might be related to setting up persistent access or configurations.\n\nAnother event is a remote command execution. That's a big red flag. If a process is executing a remote command, that could indicate a connection to a C2 server or some form of remote access. \n\nPutting this all together: the presence of a PowerShell script being executed with bypassed execution policy, temporary files created and deleted, and a remote command execution task. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like winlogbeat creating config files), the combination of the PowerShell activities and the remote execution suggests something suspicious. The confidence isn't 100% because some parts could be legitimate, but the overall pattern points towards a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell script execution with bypassed execution policy, temporary file creation\/deletion, and a remote command execution event. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal installation step, probably not suspicious.\n\nNext, mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE set registry values. Those are legitimate processes, so maybe just normal user activity.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being created. PowerShell is common, but I need to check the command line. The first one has a command line that's just the path, no arguments. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events: several .dll files from Windows System32 and .NET Framework. These are standard for PowerShell, so normal.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then immediately deleted. That's interesting. Creating and deleting a script file quickly might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. Also, the name suggests it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, which could be part of a malicious script trying to bypass restrictions.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of creating and deleting a script file in Temp could indicate something malicious.\n\nAlso, multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for PowerShell. These might be part of normal operations, but if they're frequent or in unusual contexts, they could be suspicious.\n\nThe key points here are the creation and deletion of the temporary script file. That behavior is often seen in attacks where malware tries to execute a script and then clean up after itself. The fact that it's in the Temp directory and the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be a red flag, as it could be an attempt to test or bypass script execution policies.\n\nI should also check if there are any other unusual activities. The events involve Windows Defender DLLs being loaded, which is normal. The process names like mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE are legitimate. However, the combination of PowerShell creating a file and then deleting it quickly is suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show some potentially malicious behavior, so the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, which is a common indicator of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes created and immediately deleted a temporary script file in the user's Temp directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1), which is a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts and then remove evidence.
