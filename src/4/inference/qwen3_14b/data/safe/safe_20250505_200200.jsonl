{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's normal for a log shipping tool. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is common but could be a red flag if it's doing something unusual. Then ssh.exe making a network connection, which might be normal if the user uses SSH, but maybe not if it's unexpected.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file. That might be part of its normal operation, like configuration updates. However, the repeated creation of the same file could be a sign of something wrong, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there's Explorer.EXE setting a registry value. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. The powershell.exe processes have several ImageLoad events, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal.\n\nWait, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file in AppData\\Local\\Temp, named __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1, and then immediately a FileDeleteDetected for the same file. Creating and deleting a script file quickly might be part of a script execution that's being cleaned up. But why would that happen? Maybe a benign script, but sometimes attackers create and delete files to avoid detection. However, the fact that it's a PowerShell script could be normal if the user is running legitimate scripts. But the deletion might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell. Not sure what that means, but maybe just part of the process lifecycle.\n\nLooking at the other events, most are related to normal operations: file creation, process access, network connections. However, the combination of the temporary script file creation and deletion might indicate an attempt to execute a script that was quickly removed. But without more context, like the content of the script or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is that winlogbeat is being used, which is a log shipper. If it's creating configuration files, that's normal. But if there are other unusual activities alongside, like unexpected network connections or process accesses, that could be a sign.\n\nThe ssh.exe creating a known_hosts file is normal for SSH usage. The network connections from ssh.exe might be legitimate.\n\nThe repeated FileCreate events for the same .yml.new file by winlogbeat might be part of its normal operation, but maybe there's a loop or something causing it to repeatedly create the file. However, the user might just be configuring it multiple times.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the temporary script file created and deleted, and the multiple file creations by winlogbeat. However, without more context or other indicators of compromise (like unusual network traffic, unexpected commands, or other malicious activities), it's possible that these are just normal operations. But the script creation and deletion could be a low-level indicator of something more. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I think the presence of the temporary script and the repeated file creation might warrant further investigation, even if they aren't conclusive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes a mix of normal operational activities and potential indicators of interest that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activities**\n1. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:  \n   - Repeated creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the `Downloads` directory is consistent with configuration updates or log shipping tool behavior. This is likely benign unless tied to other anomalies.\n\n2. **SSH and PowerShell Usage**:  \n   - `ssh.exe` creating a `known_hosts` file and network connections are typical for SSH usage.  \n   - PowerShell's `ImageLoad` events for standard DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) align with normal .NET operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Interest**\n1. **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion**:  \n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is created in `AppData\\Local\\Temp` and immediately deleted.  \n   - **Why This Matters**:  \n     - **Script Execution**: The creation and deletion of a script file could indicate a transient script execution (e.g., for policy testing or automation).  \n     - **Ephemeral Artifacts**: Attackers often delete files after execution to avoid detection. While not conclusive, this behavior is suspicious without context (e.g., if the script is linked to malicious activity).\n\n2. **Repeated File Creation by Winlogbeat**:  \n   - Multiple entries of `winlogbeat.exe` creating the same `.yml.new` file may suggest a loop or misconfiguration. This could be benign (e.g., iterative configuration testing) or a sign of tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n- **Check Script Content**:  \n  - If the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) was accessible before deletion, analyze its contents for malicious commands (e.g., PowerShell obfuscation, network exfiltration, or credential theft).  \n  - **Note**: The filename includes `PSScriptPolicyTest`, which might be part of a legitimate test, but further context is needed.\n\n- **Monitor Winlogbeat Activity**:  \n  - Investigate why `winlogbeat.exe` is repeatedly creating the `.yml.new` file. Check for configuration changes, errors, or unauthorized modifications to the tool.\n\n- **Correlate with Network Traffic**:  \n  - Review network logs for `ssh.exe` and PowerShell to ensure connections are to expected destinations (e.g., legitimate SSH servers, not C2 endpoints).\n\n- **Check for Anomalies in PowerShell Usage**:  \n  - Look for unusual PowerShell commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`, or `IEX`), which could indicate exploitation or lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile many events are routine, the **creation and deletion of the temporary PowerShell script** and **repeated file creation by Winlogbeat** are **low-level indicators** that warrant closer examination. These could be benign (e.g., testing or configuration) or part of a more complex attack chain. Further analysis of logs, network traffic, and script content is recommended to determine if this is a false positive or a genuine threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. Both entries have the process name \"svchost.exe\" and are related to file creation under the XboxLive directory. The first event is the creation of the directory itself, and the second is a file named AuthStateCache.dat within that directory.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because it's often used to execute malicious code. The fact that two files are being created in the XboxLive folder might be normal, but I should check if this is typical behavior.\n\nWait, the XboxLive directory is usually associated with user data, but the systemprofile is a system account. The path is under System32, which is a protected directory. Creating files there might be suspicious if it's not part of a known legitimate process. However, the XboxLive folder might be part of some legitimate operations, like game authentication. \n\nBut why two consecutive file creations? The first is a directory, the second a specific file. Maybe it's part of a normal setup. However, the classification here is about whether the batch is interesting. The key points are the process (svchost.exe), the location (System32\/config\/systemprofile\/AppData), and the files created. \n\nI should consider if there's any known malicious activity related to these paths. If these events are isolated, they might not be a big deal, but since the user is asking about the entire batch, maybe there's a pattern. However, with only two events, it's hard to tell. The confidence level might be moderate. \n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The main point is that svchost.exe creating files in a protected directory could be suspicious, but without more context, it's not definitive. So the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. The justification would be that svchost.exe creating files in a protected system directory might indicate potential malicious activity, but further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"svchost.exe creating files in a protected system directory (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\config\\\\systemprofile\\\\AppData) may indicate potential malicious activity, though further context is needed to confirm.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
