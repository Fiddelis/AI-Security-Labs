{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. First, I'll look through each entry to see what's going on.\n\nThere are multiple PowerShell.exe processes being executed. Some of them are running simple commands like Get-Date, which is a common administrative task. However, I notice that there are several file creation and deletion events related to temporary files and script files. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1 is created and then deleted. That might be part of a script execution, but it's not immediately suspicious unless there's something unusual about the script's content or behavior.\n\nThen, there are events related to image loading, like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are .NET framework components, so loading them is normal when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes. However, I should check if there's any unexpected activity here.\n\nAnother thing is the use of the Registry value set events. PowerShell can modify the registry, which is a common action for configuration changes, but if done in a way that's not typical for the user, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI also see a few events related to Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of a configuration update, but again, unless there's an unusual path or content, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, the majority of events seem to be routine operations: running scripts, creating and deleting temporary files, accessing the registry, and loading necessary DLLs. There's no indication of network activity, unusual process creation, or privilege escalation. The only potentially suspicious part is the repeated creation and deletion of the temporary script file. However, since it's a temporary file and the command is simple, it might just be a normal script execution.\n\nConsidering all this, the events don't show a clear pattern of malicious behavior. They are more aligned with normal administrative tasks. Therefore, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 because while there are some events that could be flagged, they don't form a clear malicious pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal administrative activities (e.g., PowerShell script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
