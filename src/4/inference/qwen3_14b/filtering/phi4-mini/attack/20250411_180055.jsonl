{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell processes. There's a lot of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. But what stands out is the use of Compress-Archive in the command lines. That's a PowerShell cmdlet used to compress files. Now, why is that significant?\n\nWell, compressing files could be normal, but when combined with other activities, it might be suspicious. Let me check the other events. There are several 'Registry value set' events, which might indicate changes to the registry, possibly for persistence or configuration. Then there are 'Image loaded' events pointing to some DLLs, including Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That could be legitimate, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. That's common in some malicious activities where they don't want to leave traces. However, it's also common in legitimate scripts that generate temporary files.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, each Compress-Archive command is archiving different paths. The paths are a mix of system directories and user-specific temp folders. The fact that there are multiple instances of Compress-Archive being used might indicate that someone is trying to move files around, possibly exfiltrating data or preparing for something else.\n\nAlso, the repetition of similar commands with different paths might suggest automation or a script that's being run multiple times. But without more context, like network activity or other process behaviors, it's hard to say for sure. However, the combination of these events—multiple process creations, registry changes, loading of DLLs, and file operations—could be indicative of a malicious actor trying to establish persistence or execute a payload.\n\nWait, but some of these events are from the Windows Defender DLLs. That might be a red herring. Maybe the attacker is trying to mimic legitimate processes. However, the use of PowerShell for these operations, especially with the Compress-Archive cmdlet, might be part of a larger attack chain. \n\nAnother point is the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be worth investigating.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, use of Compress-Archive, registry modifications, loading of system DLLs, and temporary file operations. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination and frequency might indicate something malicious. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential suspicious activity** warranting further investigation, based on the following key observations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated Use of `Compress-Archive` in PowerShell Commands**\n- **Pattern**: Multiple PowerShell processes execute the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet to archive files from various system paths (e.g., `C:\\pacote_logico\\...`, `C:\\modulo_ativo\\...`) into temporary directories (`$env:TEMP`).\n- **Implication**: \n  - **Legitimate Use**: Compressing files is common in scripts, but the **repetition across different paths** and the **lack of clear purpose** (e.g., no mention of file transfer, backup, or user-initiated tasks) raises suspicion.\n  - **Potential Malicious Intent**: Could be part of **data exfiltration** (compressing files for stealthy transfer) or **preparing payloads** (e.g., packing malicious binaries for execution).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual File and Pipe Operations**\n- **File Creation\/Deletion**: \n  - A temporary file is created (`C:\\Windows\\Temp\\...`) and immediately deleted (`File Delete logged`), which is a **common tactic in malware** to avoid leaving traces.\n- **Pipe Creation**:\n  - A `Pipe Created` event is logged. While pipes are normal for inter-process communication, this could be used to **hide malicious activity** (e.g., communication between processes without direct network traffic).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Loading of System DLLs**\n- **Windows Defender DLLs** (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are loaded via `Image Load` events. \n  - **Legitimate Context**: These are part of Windows Defender, but **malware often mimics legitimate processes** to evade detection.\n  - **Red Flag**: No clear connection to Windows Defender tasks (e.g., scanning, real-time protection) is indicated in the logs, suggesting **potential misuse**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry Value Set** events are logged, which could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying policies). Without context, this is ambiguous but **consistent with malicious behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Lack of Clear Legitimacy**\n- **No user context**: No mention of user-initiated actions (e.g., scripts run by users, scheduled tasks) to justify the activity.\n- **No network activity**: No evidence of file transfer or communication with external servers, which is **odd for compression** (typically followed by exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events (e.g., `Compress-Archive`, registry changes) could be legitimate, the **combination of repeated PowerShell activity, temporary file operations, and loading of system DLLs** without clear justification **strongly suggests** this warrants **further investigation**. \n- **Next Steps**: \n  - Correlate with network logs (e.g., check for outbound traffic to IPs\/URLs).\n  - Analyze process trees (e.g., check if PowerShell is spawned by suspicious parents).\n  - Inspect the contents of compressed files (if accessible) for malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**—potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) require deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. The command lines involve Compress-Archive with paths that have a lot of nested directories, like \"C:\\\\objeto_auxiliar\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\componente_principal\\\\bin\\\\modulo_temporario\". These paths seem a bit unusual with all those Portuguese-sounding words. Maybe that's just the naming convention, but sometimes attackers use obfuscation or non-standard paths to hide their activities.\n\nThe destination paths are in the TEMP directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The use of $env:TEMP is normal, but combined with the odd source paths, it might be worth looking into. Also, the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1 module is being used, which is a legitimate module, but if it's being used in a way that's not typical, that could be a red flag.\n\nOther events include Registry value sets and Process accessed events, but those are common and not necessarily malicious. The Chrome.exe events are mostly about registry changes and image loads, which are normal. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file, which might be part of a log collection tool, so not suspicious unless there's something else.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same command structure with different paths might indicate automated behavior. If someone is compressing multiple directories into the TEMP folder, it could be part of data exfiltration or preparing files for transfer. But without more context, like network activity or other malicious indicators, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands using Compress-Archive in the TEMP directory could be benign, like a script that's archiving files temporarily. But the unusual path names and the frequency might suggest something more. However, since there's no evidence of network connections, file deletions, or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious elements but not enough to confirm malicious intent. The confidence is moderate, so maybe around 0.6. The classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of PowerShell commands, unusual paths, and TEMP directory usage could be indicative of something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute Compress-Archive commands with obfuscated paths containing non-English terms (e.g., 'objeto_auxiliar', 'elemento_secundario') and write to $env:TEMP, which is commonly used in malware for transient file operations. The repetitive pattern of directory structures and lack of clear benign context warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these two events. The first one is about the 'whoami.exe' process being created. That's a legitimate Windows utility used to display the current user's identity. The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is normal. The winlog task is 'Process Create' under the ProcessCreate rule, which is a standard event for process creation.\n\nThe second event is about 'powershell.exe' being accessed. PowerShell is a common administrative tool, so its usage isn't inherently suspicious. The winlog task here is 'Process accessed' under ProcessAccess rule. However, just accessing PowerShell isn't necessarily malicious. \n\nNow, considering both events together. Both are standard processes used in Windows. There's no indication of unusual activity here. No signs of privilege escalation, no unexpected command lines, and no file operations that might suggest malware. The events don't show any anomalies that would require further investigation. So, I'd classify this as not interesting because they're normal system activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Both events involve standard Windows processes (whoami.exe and powershell.exe) with no suspicious indicators. The activities align with normal system behavior and lack signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
