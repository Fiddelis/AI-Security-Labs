{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, but chrome doing registry changes isn't necessarily bad. Maybe part of normal operations or updates. But repeated entries might be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys, but the logs don't specify which registry values. Hmm.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, so probably harmless. But the command line is straightforward.\n\nThen, looking at the powershell.exe entries again. One of them has a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. Wait, Get-Keystrokes sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malware technique to steal sensitive information. That's a big red flag. The script is being executed multiple times with different paths, which might indicate an attempt to log keystrokes repeatedly or from different locations.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading various .dll files. Some of these are .NET framework components, which is normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a sign that the system is detecting something, but it's not clear if it's related to the PowerShell activities.\n\nThen, there are entries where PowerShell creates and deletes a temporary script file. Creating a script, then deleting it could be an attempt to hide evidence. The file path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but combined with the keystroke logging script, it's concerning.\n\nThe repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths might be an indicator of a malicious script trying to log keystrokes. Even though the logs don't show the actual content of the scripts, the names and the actions (file creation, registry changes, and temporary file handling) are suspicious. Also, the fact that the same script is referenced multiple times with different paths could be an attempt to evade detection by varying the location each time.\n\nAdditionally, the Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which could be used by malware to communicate with other processes or exfiltrate data. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of the keystroke logging script, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the multiple registry changes by PowerShell are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of these events points towards a possible security threat that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential malicious activity** that warrants investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Keystroke Logging Scripts**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` from various paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_padrao\\...`). This script name is strongly associated with **malware** designed to **capture keystrokes** (e.g., stealing passwords, sensitive data).\n   - The script's use of `env:TEMP` as a log path suggests **attempts to evade detection** by using temporary directories.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - PowerShell creates a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1`) in `AppData\\Local\\Temp` and immediately deletes it. This behavior is common in **malware** to **hide evidence** of execution.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated `File created` and `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` could indicate **tampering with system settings** or **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup entries).\n\n4. **Windows Defender DLL**:\n   - The presence of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component) in an `Image Load` event might suggest **antivirus evasion** or **interaction with security software** (though this alone is not conclusive).\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)**, potentially used for **data exfiltration** or **malware coordination**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **multiple red flags** consistent with **malicious behavior**, particularly **keystroke logging** and **attempts to hide activity**. While some entries (e.g., `whoami.exe`, normal file creation) are benign, the combination of the above indicators strongly suggests **a potential security threat**. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` scripts** for malicious content.\n- **Check the system for unauthorized processes** or modifications to registry keys.\n- **Scan for malware** using updated antivirus tools (Windows Defender or third-party solutions).\n- **Monitor network traffic** for data exfiltration (e.g., keystroke logs being sent to external servers).\n\nThis batch of logs is **definitely interesting for investigation** and may indicate a **compromise**."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, and it's logging keystrokes to a temporary file. That immediately raises a red flag because keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information like passwords. The path mentioned here is C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that it's using the $env:TEMP directory for the log file is another suspicious point because temporary directories are often used to hide malicious activities.\n\nThen, there's another event where the same script is executed again, but the path is slightly different: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Even though the script name is the same, the different directory paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the location of the malicious script. This could be part of a larger attack where the attacker is moving laterally or trying to avoid detection.\n\nOther events involve PowerShell creating files in user directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_temporario.txt and C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt. While creating files in downloads folders isn't inherently malicious, when combined with the keystroke logging, it might suggest that the attacker is storing data or preparing for further actions. However, these files alone might not be enough to raise suspicion without more context.\n\nAnother event mentions a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs. However, the presence of multiple file creation events, especially by PowerShell, could indicate that the system is being used for data exfiltration or other malicious activities.\n\nThe Registry value set events for both PowerShell and conhost.exe might be part of the malware's persistence mechanism, trying to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a common tactic used by malware to maintain access to the system.\n\nI should also check for any other indicators of compromise. The logs don't show any obvious network activity, but the presence of keystroke logging and file creation in multiple locations is concerning. The use of PowerShell for these activities is a known method used by attackers, especially in advanced persistent threat scenarios.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, the use of temporary directories for logging, and the potential for persistence through registry changes all point towards malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like winlogbeat creating files), the combination of these events is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executed malicious keystroke logging scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with temporary file paths, indicating potential data exfiltration. Repeated script executions from different directories suggest obfuscation tactics, while registry modifications and file creation events in user directories indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
