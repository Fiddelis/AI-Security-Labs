{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line has a part where it's running PowerShell with -ep bypass and pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a red flag because using -ep bypass is often used to bypass execution policies, which is common in malicious scripts. Also, creating a scheduled task that runs daily under the system account might be an attempt to persistently execute code.\n\nThen there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a task again, but this time the script path is different (entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1). Both scripts are non-existent, which could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not actually present, maybe to avoid detection or because the real script is being loaded from another source.\n\nThere are multiple entries for svchost.exe with registry value sets. While svchost.exe is a normal system process, excessive registry changes might indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The file creation events for winlogbeat.yml.new and some text files might be benign, like configuration files, but I need to check if they're related to the suspicious activities.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all registry value sets. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so this could be a sign of something else, but it's not definitive. The whoami.exe process is standard for checking user context, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the scheduled tasks created with PowerShell using bypassed execution policies and non-existent scripts. These are classic indicators of malicious activity, especially the use of schtasks to schedule tasks under the system account and the PowerShell command with -ep bypass. The repetition of similar commands in different events strengthens the case. Even though there are other processes like svchost and chrome, the main suspicious activities are the PowerShell and schtasks events. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show creation of scheduled tasks (schtasks) with PowerShell commands using -ep bypass (bypassing execution policy) to execute non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'). This pattern is commonly associated with malicious persistence mechanisms and potential script-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
