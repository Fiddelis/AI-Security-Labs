The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The command line has a PowerShell script being executed with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag because it suggests the script might not exist, which could be a sign of a malicious attempt to execute a non-existent file, possibly to evade detection.\n\nNext, there's another event with schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" in the filename. This repetition of creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts is suspicious. Scheduled tasks running under the system account with daily triggers could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there are events related to ImageLoad for schtasks.exe and taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate system file, so that's normal. However, the creation of a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times suggests that the scheduled task was successfully created. The fact that the task is named \"win32times\" might be a misleading name to make it look benign.\n\nOther events involve svchost.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe creating files or modifying the registry. However, the key points here are the scheduled task creations with non-existent PowerShell scripts. The use of -ep bypass is a common tactic in PowerShell-based attacks to execute scripts without being blocked by the execution policy. \n\nEven though the scripts mentioned don't exist, the act of trying to run them could be part of an attack, such as attempting to execute a payload that's being downloaded or generated dynamically. The fact that the user is creating scheduled tasks under the system account with daily execution could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nThe other events don't seem to be directly related to malicious activity. The winlogbeat files being created might be part of log collection, and chrome.exe's registry changes might be normal. However, the focus here is on the schtasks and PowerShell events.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts using elevated privileges (running as system), which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), combined with -ep bypass to bypass execution policies. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
