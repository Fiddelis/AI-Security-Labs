The user provided a bunch of JSON events, mostly related to PowerShell and some other processes.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes: there's a 'whoami.exe' which is normal, but then multiple 'powershell.exe' entries. The command lines involve Compress-Archive, which is part of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module. That's a built-in cmdlet, so maybe that's just regular use. However, the paths being compressed are a mix of different directories, some of which have names that are a bit generic, like 'objeto_secundario' or 'modulo_principal'—but that could just be part of the file structure.\n\nWait, but the events include 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' for temporary files. That's common, but not suspicious. There's also 'Image loaded' events for clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal for PowerShell to load those.\n\nThen there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file, which might be part of log collection, but not necessarily malicious. The other processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe with registry changes or image loads don't seem out of the ordinary.\n\nBut wait, the repetition of the same Compress-Archive command across multiple events might indicate automated or scripted behavior. However, without more context, like unusual parameters or unexpected destinations, it's hard to say. The fact that the same module is being loaded multiple times might be normal if the scripts are running multiple times.\n\nHmm, but all these events could be part of legitimate activities, like backups or packaging files. There's no indication of malware or suspicious network activity here. The classification might be 'not interesting' unless there's something else. But I need to check if there's any red flags. No unusual processes, no unexpected file paths that are known for malicious activity. The user might be looking for something like lateral movement or data exfiltration, but these logs don't show that. So maybe it's just normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs consist of a series of system and process events, primarily involving **PowerShell** and standard Windows utilities. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries involve the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet from the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive` module. This is a legitimate built-in PowerShell command used for archiving files.\n   - Paths being compressed (e.g., `objeto_secundario`, `modulo_principal`) appear generic and non-malicious, though the repetitive use of `Compress-Archive` could indicate automated scripting or backup tasks.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - Temporary files are created and deleted (e.g., in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`), which is typical for PowerShell sessions.\n   - A `winlogbeat.exe` process creates a `.yml.new` file, likely part of configuration updates for the log shipper tool.\n\n3. **Standard System Processes:**\n   - Events involving `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `urlmon.dll` are benign and align with normal user interactions or system operations.\n\n4. **No Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - No unusual network activity, unexpected executables, or anomalous registry changes are detected.\n   - The `.NET` assemblies (`clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) loaded by PowerShell are standard and expected.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect **normal system behavior** and legitimate administrative tasks (e.g., file compression, logging). There is **no evidence of malicious activity** or security threats. \n\n**Final Classification:**  \n**Not interesting for investigation** — the events are consistent with standard operations and lack suspicious patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. The user provided several JSON entries. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst event: Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll from System32. That's normal, right? Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so maybe legitimate. But why is Calculator.exe doing that? Wait, Calculator is a standard app, but maybe it's being used here. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nNext four events: Chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying key settings, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe Chrome is just updating its own settings. However, repeated registry changes might be a sign of something else, like a malware trying to persist.\n\nThen another Chrome.exe event loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. That's a legitimate file, part of Defender. So that's probably normal. But why is Chrome loading it? Maybe a plugin or extension? Not sure.\n\nThen PowerShell.exe had a process access event. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. But again, without more info on what it's accessing, it's hard to tell. It could be a normal script or something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs have a mix of normal activities (like Chrome setting registry values, Defender DLL being loaded) and some that are a bit odd (Calculator loading urlmon.dll, PowerShell activity). However, none of the events seem to be clearly malicious. The repeated registry changes by Chrome might be benign, like updates. The Calculator event is suspicious but not conclusive. The PowerShell event is also not enough on its own.\n\nSo overall, the batch doesn't have clear signs of a security threat. The events are either normal or not specific enough to be classified as interesting. Therefore, the classification is probably NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events contain normal system activities (e.g., Chrome modifying registry values, legitimate DLLs being loaded) and no clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior. The Calculator.exe and PowerShell.exe events lack context to suggest malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
