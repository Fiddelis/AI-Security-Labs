First, I'll scan through the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about Chrome and PowerShell. The Chrome ones are all registry value sets, which might be normal, but repeated registry changes could be suspicious. However, the main focus here seems to be on PowerShell.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: there's a process accessed, image loaded (some .dll files), and then several command lines that run Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the Temp directory. That script name sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a red flag. Also, there are file creations and deletions in the Temp folder, which might be part of an attack to hide evidence. The Pipe Created event could be used for inter-process communication, maybe for exfiltrating data.\n\nThe fact that multiple PowerShell processes are executing similar scripts with the same log path suggests a pattern. Even though some events are normal (like loading .dlls), the combination of keystroke logging scripts and temporary file handling is concerning. The classification here should be interesting because it indicates potential malicious activity, like keylogging, which is a common attack vector. The confidence is high because the evidence points to a possible security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with Temp directory logging, combined with file creation\/deletion in Temp and suspicious image loads, indicates potential keystroke logging and data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: The process is powershell.exe running a script that's downloading keystrokes and saving them to a temporary file. The command line includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with keyloggers, which are malicious.\n\nSecond event: The file path is C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The same script name appears again. This might be part of the same malicious activity, maybe the script is being executed from a different location.\n\nThird event: Powershell.exe creates a file in the user's Downloads folder named pacote_temporario.txt. Not sure if this is malicious yet, but creating files in Downloads could be normal or part of a download process.\n\nFourth event: Svchost.exe creates a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. That's a legitimate system process, so this might be a normal activity. However, svchost can sometimes be used by malware, but the file path here seems standard.\n\nFifth event: Powershell.exe again creates a file in the user's Downloads, this time entrada_padrao.txt. Again, this could be benign, but combined with the previous events, maybe part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events mention Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a red flag. Keystroke logging is typically used for stealing sensitive information. Even though the other events involve file creation in Downloads, which could be normal, the presence of the keylogger script is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The combination of the script name and the task related to executing a remote command makes me think this is a phishing or malware attempt. The confidence is high because the keylogger is a clear sign of interest.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with a log path in the TEMP directory, indicating potential keystroke logging (a common malicious activity).
