So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several process creations. The first event is 'whoami.exe', which is a normal command to check the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there's 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes creating a service called 'win32times' with a binPath pointing to a PowerShell script. Wait, the script paths are 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The names have 'NonExistingScript' in them, which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to create a service that runs a non-existent script, which could be a way to hide malicious activity or test if the script exists. \n\nThen there's 'sc.exe' being used to create and query the service. Using 'sc create' and 'sc qc' is normal for managing services, but combining it with a command that starts a PowerShell script is suspicious. Also, the fact that the script isn't found (NonExisting) might indicate an attempt to execute a script that doesn't exist, possibly to bypass detection or as part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at other events, there are registry value sets and image loads. The 'urlmon.dll' and 'amsi.dll' being loaded by chrome.exe and calculator.exe might be normal, but if those are being loaded from unexpected places, that could be an issue. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe not. \n\nThere's also 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal, but the presence of a new file might be part of legitimate setup. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. \n\nOther processes like 'notepad.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'svchost.exe', and 'chrome.exe' are common and their activities (registry changes) might be normal. However, the repeated 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe could be worth noting. \n\nThe key suspicious points are the use of 'sc.exe' to create a service that references a non-existent PowerShell script. This could be an attempt to execute a script that's not present, which might be part of a larger attack, like a staged payload or trying to check for the presence of a file. Also, the use of 'cmd \/c start' to launch the script might be a way to obfuscate the command. \n\nAnother thing is that the 'cmd.exe' command line includes both creating the service and querying it ('sc qc win32times'), which might be part of an attempt to set up a persistent backdoor. Even though the script doesn't exist, the act of creating the service is suspicious. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution here. The scripts are non-existent, so maybe this is just a test or a failed attempt. But combined with the service creation, it's a possible indicator of compromise. \n\nI should also check if there are any other unusual patterns. The 'powershell.exe' events are there, but without command lines, it's hard to tell. The 'Image loaded' events for standard DLLs might be normal. \n\nConsidering all this, the presence of creating a service with a non-existent script is a red flag. Even though it's not certain, the combination of events suggests potential malicious activity. So, the classification would be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence level around 0.75. The justification is the suspicious service creation and the non-existent script path.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious process creations involving 'sc.exe' and 'cmd.exe' attempting to create a service ('win32times') with a non-existent PowerShell script path. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity to establish persistence or execute hidden payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
