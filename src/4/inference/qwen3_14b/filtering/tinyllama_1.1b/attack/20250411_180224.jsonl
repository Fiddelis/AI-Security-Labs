The first event stands out because it's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes powershell.exe -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\", which seems suspicious because it's named as if it doesn't exist. The task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there's a process access event for powershell.exe, but no command line details. The other events involve registry changes and image loads, but nothing too alarming. The schtasks.exe events are part of the scheduled task creation, which is normal but combined with the previous event, it's concerning. The chrome.exe events are just registry changes, which might be normal user activity. The winlogbeat.exe event is about a file creation, which could be part of a legitimate setup. The whoami.exe is a standard command to check the user, so that's probably benign.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activity is the scheduled task creation with a non-existent script and using bypass for PowerShell execution policy. This could be an attempt to execute malicious code. The other events don't add up to anything malicious on their own, but the combination of the scheduled task and the PowerShell bypass is a strong indicator of potential compromise. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious scheduled task creation via cmd.exe with a PowerShell command using '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policy) and a non-existent script path 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. This combination of system-level task scheduling, PowerShell bypass, and reference to a non-existent script suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
