So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process that downloads a file from a GitHub raw URL. The command line shows it's using WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file into the TEMP directory. That seems a bit odd because downloading a license file isn't inherently malicious, but the repetition of such events might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate, but the multiple ImageLoad entries could indicate something trying to inject code or load additional modules. Also, there's a FileCreate and then FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then immediately deleting a file might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe command lines for the PowerShell processes all involve downloading files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that multiple different repositories are being accessed, and the filenames are all LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, but the pattern of downloading and then deleting the file could be suspicious. Also, the use of PowerShell for such operations, especially with the WebClient object, is something that could be used for downloading malicious payloads.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here, like executing a payload, writing to disk, or connecting to a suspicious IP. The events are mostly about process creation, network activity, and file operations that could be part of normal system behavior. But the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads, image loads, and temporary file creation\/deletion might indicate a potential security incident, especially if these events are out of the ordinary for the system.\n\nConsidering all that, the classification is probably \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a PowerShell command that uses WebClient's DownloadFile method to download a LICENSE.txt from a GitHub raw link. The URLs are from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is normal for downloading files, but the fact that it's being done via PowerShell might be a red flag. However, downloading a LICENSE file isn't necessarily bad. But wait, there are multiple such events. Let me count: there are three entries where PowerShell is downloading files from GitHub. The paths they're saving to are in the TEMP directory, which is often used by malware to store temporary files. But again, that's not conclusive on its own.\n\nThen there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. That's a regular download path, so maybe that's just a user downloading something. However, the other files created are in the TEMP directory, which is more suspicious. Also, there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Not sure about that one, but maybe not a big issue.\n\nNow, looking at the chrome.exe entries. There are eight instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That seems excessive. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much unless there's some extension or malware doing it. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, multiple registry changes from the same process might indicate something malicious.\n\nAnother point is the Network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe it's just normal activity. But if there's a lot of network connections, that could be a sign of data exfiltration. However, in this batch, there's only one such event.\n\nThe Dns query event is there, but no process is specified, which might be a placeholder or an error. Not sure if that's significant.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe events are about creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just part of its normal operation. But the same file is being created multiple times, which might be an error or a misconfiguration.\n\nPutting this all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, even though they're LICENSE files. However, attackers often use similar techniques to download malicious payloads. The fact that there are three separate downloads, each with different GitHub repositories, might indicate that the user is trying to download different files, which could be part of a larger attack. Also, the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be a sign of something wrong. But I need to check if the GitHub URLs are actually malicious. Since the user hasn't provided the actual URLs beyond the domain, I can't verify that. However, the use of DownloadFile via PowerShell is a common method used in attacks, so that's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the file created in the TEMP directory. If the downloaded file is a legitimate LICENSE.txt, it might be harmless, but if the content is malicious, that's a problem. However, without the actual content, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple such events could be indicative of an attack.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple file creations in the same path by winlogbeat.exe might indicate a problem with that tool's configuration, but that's a lower priority compared to the PowerShell activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show some suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Therefore, it's likely that this batch is interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, indicating potential malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Download Activities**  \n   - **Multiple `PowerShell.exe` processes** are observed downloading files from **GitHub raw URLs** (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`) using the `WebClient.DownloadFile` method. While downloading files from GitHub is not inherently malicious, this technique is commonly abused by attackers to exfiltrate data or deploy payloads.  \n   - **Files are saved to temporary directories** (e.g., `TEMP`), which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection. The filenames (`LICENSE.txt`) are generic and could mask malicious content.\n\n2. **Excessive Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`**  \n   - **Eight instances** of `chrome.exe` modifying registry values are logged. This is unusual for Chrome, which typically does not perform such frequent or unexplained registry changes. This could indicate tampering (e.g., by malware or compromised extensions).\n\n3. **Repeated File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**  \n   - **Multiple events** show `winlogbeat.exe` creating the same file (`winlogbeat.yml.new`) in the `Downloads` directory. This could suggest a misconfiguration, data leakage, or an attempt to overwrite configuration files.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Behavior**  \n   - **`MpDefenderCoreService.exe`** (Windows Defender) has a network connection event, which may be legitimate but could also indicate an attempt to bypass security software.  \n   - **`RuntimeBroker.exe` and `notepad.exe`** modifying registry values is atypical and may signal unauthorized access or tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe combination of **PowerShell-based downloads from external sources**, **abnormal registry modifications**, and **repeated file creation** by legitimate tools raises **strong red flags**. These activities could indicate:  \n- **Data exfiltration** (e.g., stealing files via `DownloadFile`).  \n- **Malware persistence** (e.g., registry changes to maintain control).  \n- **Compromised systems** (e.g., `chrome.exe` or `winlogbeat.exe` being exploited).  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Investigate the contents of the downloaded files (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`) to confirm legitimacy.  \n- Audit registry changes by `chrome.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` for unauthorized modifications.  \n- Check network traffic from `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` for signs of evasion or data leakage.  \n- Ensure `winlogbeat.exe` is configured securely and not being abused.  \n\nThis batch **definitely warrants further investigation** due to the high-risk indicators present."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's calc.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and reg.exe. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe are often used in attacks. \n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There's \"Image loaded\" for urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file, but that's normal. Then there are multiple \"Registry value set\" events. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys in Run or other areas. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with \/F, which is a force delete. That might be part of removing a malicious task. Then, there's a reg.exe command deleting entries under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's a red flag because deleting registry entries in the Run key could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there's a schtasks.exe process that deletes the same \"spawn\" task. Scheduled tasks being deleted might indicate someone trying to clean up after themselves. \n\nThe repetition of certain events, like multiple Registry value sets and Process accesses, suggests ongoing activity. The presence of whoami.exe might be checking user context, which is common in attacks to confirm privileges. \n\nPutting this together: the combination of registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks, and use of command-line tools to manipulate the system could indicate an attacker trying to remove traces of their activities. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate maintenance. But the frequency and the specific commands (like deleting Run entries and tasks) lean towards malicious intent. \n\nConfidence is a bit over 0.5 but not too high because some actions are normal. Maybe around 0.65. The justification would be the suspicious registry edits and task deletions that might be part of cleanup after an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated registry modifications (RegistryEvent tasks), deletion of scheduled tasks (SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F), and attempts to remove registry entries under HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run, which may indicate cleanup after malicious persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event related to processes and files. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. A lot of them involve powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the tasks associated with these processes. There are entries like \"Process accessed\", \"Registry value set\", \"Image loaded\", \"File created\", and \"File Delete logged\". \n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" events, some of the files loaded are .dlls from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender. That seems normal because PowerShell might use those libraries. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1\". The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to testing script policies. However, the fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted could be part of a normal process, like temporary script execution. But maybe it's a red flag if there's a pattern of creating and deleting files quickly, especially if the content isn't known.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks with command_line as \"powershell.exe & {}\". The \"{}\" might indicate an empty script or a placeholder, which could be a sign of obfuscation or something being hidden. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThere's also a \"Pipe Created\" event, which could be normal, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for communication between processes. However, that alone isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nI notice that some of the events are from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which is a log shipper. The file created there is a .yml.new file, which might be part of configuring Winlogbeat. That seems legitimate.\n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the combination of all events. While there are several PowerShell events, most of them seem to be part of normal operations, like loading necessary DLLs, creating temporary files, and registry changes. However, the presence of a temporary script file being created and deleted might be part of a benign process, like a script test. But if this is part of a larger pattern of suspicious activities, it might be more concerning.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual network connections, unauthorized access, or execution of suspicious scripts. The PowerShell activities appear to be standard, possibly related to policy testing or legitimate administrative tasks. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch isn't particularly interesting. The events are mostly normal system activities. However, I should note that PowerShell's use can sometimes be abused, so if there were more anomalies or if this was part of a larger set of events, it might be different. But based on what's provided, there's not enough to flag it as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events primarily reflects **normal system operations** and **legitimate PowerShell usage**, with no clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple events involve `powershell.exe` executing commands (`& {}`), creating temporary scripts (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1`), and interacting with the registry. These actions are consistent with **script testing**, **policy enforcement**, or **administrative tasks**.\n   - The creation and deletion of the temporary script file in the `Temp` directory is a common pattern for transient operations (e.g., testing or logging).\n\n2. **Legitimate DLLs and System Processes**:\n   - Loaded DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender) and processes like `conhost.exe` are standard system components. No anomalies here.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - The `winlogbeat.exe` event (creating a `.yml.new` file) is part of **log configuration updates**, a normal operation for log shippers.\n\n4. **No Red Flags**:\n   - No suspicious network activity, unauthorized access, or obfuscated commands are present.\n   - The `& {}` placeholder in command lines does not indicate malicious intent without additional context (e.g., hidden payloads).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events are **benign** and align with typical system behavior. While PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious purposes, the provided data lacks indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected network traffic, privilege escalation, or anomalous file modifications). \n\n**Classification**: **Not interesting** (normal activity)."}

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process being created. That's a normal command to get user info, so maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so that's a red flag. The events mention 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, which is normal, but when combined with PowerShell activity, it might be worth checking.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems like a no-op, maybe a test or a way to bypass detection. Also, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up. The file path includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be related to testing script execution policies, but the deletion could be an attempt to hide the file.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might not be significant by themselves, but combined with the other activities, they could indicate something. Also, the 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' modifying the registry is normal for some applications, but again, when paired with other events, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nHowever, none of the events show clear signs of exploitation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The activities are more about process creation, registry changes, and file operations. While the PowerShell usage and file creation\/deletion are concerning, they might be part of legitimate system behavior or testing. But the combination of these events, especially the multiple PowerShell instances and the temporary file deletion, does raise some flags.

That's normal, maybe part of some legitimate software. Then powershell.exe events. There's a Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed. Powershell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common tool for admins. Need to check for unusual commands or paths.\n\nLooking further, there's a chrome.exe with multiple registry events. Chrome is a regular application, but so many registry changes might be a red flag. However, Chrome can make registry changes during updates or normal operation. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an entry with command_line: powershell.exe & {}. That looks odd. The & {} is a PowerShell comment, but maybe it's part of a larger command that's been truncated. Could be a sign of obfuscation. Also, there are multiple Engine Lifecycle events, which might be related to some automated processes.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not malicious. But then there's a File created event in the user's AppData folder. AppData can be a target for malware to store files, but it's also used by legitimate apps. The file name StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be related to PowerShell profiles, which could be normal or malicious.\n\nAnother interesting point is the ProcessCreate event for whoami.exe, which is a standard tool to check user context. Not suspicious on its own. Then, a command to Remove-Item on a zip file in the TEMP directory. Deleting a zip file might be part of a cleanup, but if the zip was malicious, this could be an attempt to erase evidence. However, without knowing the origin of the zip, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events again: mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components, which are normal for PowerShell to load. So that's probably legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all these events: there's a lot of PowerShell activity, which is common but can be a vector for attacks. The registry changes, pipe creation, and file creation in AppData might be worth investigating. However, none of the events clearly indicate malicious activity. The removal of a zip file is suspicious but not conclusive. The presence of multiple PowerShell events could be part of a benign script or a more malicious activity. Since there's no direct evidence of exploitation, data exfiltration, or obvious malicious files, but the volume and types of events are a bit unusual, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Then, that same file is deleted, which might be part of a cleanup. However, the fact that a script is created and then deleted could be a red flag, especially if it's temporary and not part of a known process.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields. These are deleting various .zip and .txt files from the Temp directory. While deleting temporary files is common, the repetition and the use of -ErrorAction Ignore might indicate that the attacker is trying to remove evidence without causing errors. Also, the filenames like \"tarefa_base.zip\" and \"componente_comum.zip\" don't immediately ring a bell, but they could be part of a larger operation.\n\nThen there's a chrome.exe process loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, so that's normal. But the same MpOAV.dll is also loaded by powershell.exe, which might be a point of interest. However, it's possible that this is just part of the system's normal operations, especially if the process is legitimate.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might relate to PowerShell's own processes, but when combined with the file deletions, it could be part of an attempt to obfuscate activities. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from the Temp directory might suggest that the system is trying to clean up after some operations, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or other signs of compromise. The events don't mention any unusual user accounts or elevated privileges. The processes involved are standard (powershell.exe, chrome.exe, whoami.exe), and the files being deleted are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files.\n\nThe presence of multiple Remove-Item commands with the same pattern might indicate a script that's cleaning up after itself, which is common in some malicious activities. However, without more context, like network activity or other process creations, it's hard to say for sure. The classification here hinges on whether these actions are part of a larger attack or just normal system behavior.\n\nConsidering all that, while the events are not overtly malicious, the combination of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, along with the use of PowerShell for these operations, could be a sign of something worth investigating further. Therefore, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation, but not immediately malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` directory. While this is a legitimate location for PowerShell profiles, the script's purpose is unclear without additional context.\n   - Multiple `Remove-Item` commands in the `command_line` field (e.g., deleting `.zip`, `.txt` files from the Temp directory) are repeated with `-ErrorAction Ignore`, suggesting attempts to clean up artifacts without triggering errors. This could indicate obfuscation or evasion tactics.\n\n2. **File Deletion Patterns:**\n   - The repeated deletion of files (e.g., `tarefa_base.zip`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`) from the Temp directory may be part of a larger operation, though temporary file cleanup is common in both benign and malicious contexts.\n\n3. **Process and Module Loading:**\n   - `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` load legitimate modules like `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender). However, the same `MpOAV.dll` is also loaded by `powershell.exe`, which could be monitored for unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Frequent \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events may relate to PowerShell's internal operations but could also indicate scripting or automation that is not immediately malicious.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Unusual File Deletion:** The repetitive and targeted deletion of files in the Temp directory, combined with `-ErrorAction Ignore`, raises questions about intent (e.g., covering tracks).\n- **Lack of Context:** No network activity, user account details, or elevation of privileges are mentioned, making it harder to determine if these actions are part of a larger attack.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events alone do not confirm malicious activity, the **combination of script creation\/deletion, repetitive file cleanup, and PowerShell usage** warrants further investigation. This could be a **benign cleanup process** or a **preliminary step in a more complex attack**. Additional context (e.g., network logs, process tree, user behavior) would be critical to determine the true nature of these events.\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation**—the activity is not overtly malicious but exhibits patterns that merit closer scrutiny."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. There's also some events with winlogbeat.exe and whoami.exe. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell activities, there are several instances where PowerShell is trying to remove files in the TEMP directory. The commands are using Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That might be a red flag because typically, deleting temporary files isn't suspicious on its own, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be. However, I need to check if there's any other behavior that's more concerning.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. But the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be normal if it's using .NET features. However, sometimes attackers use PowerShell to execute malicious code via these DLLs, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a File created event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which is then deleted. That could be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in some attacks. But again, it's not definitive.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded. That might indicate that the system is interacting with Defender, which is normal. However, if there's an attempt to bypass Defender, that could be a problem. But I don't see any events indicating that here.\n\nLooking at the other processes, whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to check user identity. That's not suspicious. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a log file or configuration, so that's probably normal.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The repeated use of PowerShell to delete temporary files and create and delete scripts might be part of a normal process, like cleaning up after a script execution. However, the frequency and the specific paths (like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive) might be worth checking. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry value sets could indicate some configuration changes, but without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to say.\n\nI should check if there's any unusual combination of events. For example, if PowerShell is being used to execute commands that are not typical, but in this case, the commands are mostly about file management and registry changes. The presence of multiple Image Load events for legitimate DLLs might be normal.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are so many PowerShell events, especially with file creation and deletion, might be a sign of something. But without more context, like network activity or other processes, it's hard to be certain. The events don't show any obvious malicious activity, but they do show a high level of activity from PowerShell, which could be a red flag if it's out of the ordinary for the system.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are a number of PowerShell-related events, none of them individually indicate a clear security threat. However, the volume and the specific commands used might warrant further investigation to ensure that these activities are legitimate and not part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Deletion in Temp Directories**: Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting files like `pacote_ativo.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`, and others in the `%TEMP%` directory. While temporary file cleanup is common, the repetitive nature and use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` (to suppress errors) could indicate an attempt to erase evidence or bypass normal cleanup processes.\n   - **File Creation and Deletion**: A PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and later deleted, which may suggest transient execution of scripts (e.g., for payload delivery or post-exploitation tasks).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving PowerShell and `conhost.exe`. While registry changes are normal, the lack of context (e.g., what keys\/values are modified) raises questions about potential configuration tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Image Load of Defender DLLs**:\n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components). While this is legitimate, it could also indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass Defender (e.g., via API calls or evasion techniques).\n\n4. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - Files like `objeto_padrao.txt` in the `Downloads` directory and `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (a PowerShell-specific path) may be part of a larger pattern of file manipulation or persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate Processes**: \n  - `whoami.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) are used in standard ways.\n  - .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded as part of normal PowerShell\/.NET operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **do not definitively indicate a security breach**, but the **high volume of PowerShell activity** (file manipulation, registry changes) and **lack of clear benign context** (e.g., no obvious user-initiated tasks) merit further investigation. This could include:\n- Correlating with network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs).\n- Checking for unauthorized registry changes or persistence mechanisms.\n- Analyzing the contents of deleted files (if available via logs or forensics).\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**—not a clear attack, but anomalous behavior that requires deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are a lot of entries with chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe doing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. \n\nWait, there's also whoami.exe being executed several times. Whoami is a legitimate tool that shows user context, but if it's run excessively, that could indicate someone trying to check permissions or escalate privileges. \n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that might be normal. But there's also a file named \"pacote_ativo.txt\" created by powershell.exe. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a clue, but not sure yet. \n\nNow, considering all together: multiple registry changes by chrome and RuntimeBroker could be benign, but the repeated access to PowerShell and Whoami might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments or network activity, it's hard to be certain. \n\nBut the presence of multiple PowerShell accesses and Whoami executions could indicate someone probing the system. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading files, connecting to bad IPs, etc.), maybe it's not conclusive. \n\nThe confidence here is moderate. The events are suspicious but not definitively malicious. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is the repeated use of PowerShell and Whoami, which could be part of an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and whoami.exe execution, along with frequent registry modifications by chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, suggest potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation activity. The combination of process access events and file creation by powershell.exe warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
