{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe. The triggers are set to \"AtLogon,\" and the principal is set to \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with the highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights could be a sign of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, looking at the other events, there are several \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events related to PowerShell. Also, there are entries about image loads, which include .NET DLLs. While loading .NET DLLs isn't inherently malicious, when combined with the scheduled task creation, it might indicate that someone is trying to execute code with elevated privileges.\n\nBut wait, the scheduled tasks here are set to run calc.exe. Calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but using it in a scheduled task with admin rights could be a red flag. Typically, attackers might use calc.exe as a test or placeholder, but in a real attack, it could be replaced with a malicious payload. However, in this case, all the tasks are pointing to calc.exe, which might be a benign test. However, the repetition of creating multiple scheduled tasks with similar names (like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc.) might be part of a larger campaign.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple scheduled tasks are created with the same structure but different names could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. The use of \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" suggests that the task is set to run with administrative privileges, which is a high-privilege group. This could be a way for an attacker to maintain access even if a user account is compromised.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events might be false positives. For example, if the system is part of a lab environment or testing scenarios, creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell might be normal. But given that the logs include multiple instances of these events, it's more likely a security concern.\n\nAnother point is the image load events. The .NET DLLs being loaded could be part of the PowerShell execution, but it's worth noting that PowerShell can use these assemblies for various purposes. However, combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern in the scheduled task names. The names like \"tarefa_geral\" (which means general task in Portuguese) might suggest that the attacker is using localized terms, which could be a clue about the origin or intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of multiple scheduled task creations with administrative privileges, repeated PowerShell activities, and loading of .NET DLLs points towards a potential security threat. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate program, the context here is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, this batch of logs is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **Repeated Scheduled Task Creation with Admin Privileges:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands create scheduled tasks (e.g., `Register-ScheduledTask`) targeting **`calc.exe`** with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the owner and **`RunLevel Highest`**. \n   - **Example Command:**\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n   - **Why Suspicious?**  \n     - `calc.exe` is a benign utility, but its use here may be a **placeholder** for a malicious payload.  \n     - **Persistence via Scheduled Tasks** with **elevated privileges** is a common tactic in attacks to maintain access.\n\n2. **Unusual Frequency and Naming of Tasks:**\n   - Tasks are named in a non-random pattern (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, `tarefa_geral`), possibly **localized in Portuguese**, which could hint at the attackerâ€™s origin or intent.\n\n3. **.NET DLLs Loaded by PowerShell:**\n   - Logs show PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`.  \n   - **Why Suspicious?**  \n     - While legitimate, this could indicate **PowerShell remoting** or **code execution** via .NET, often used in attacks to bypass defenses.\n\n4. **Multiple \"Process Accessed\" and \"Registry Value Set\" Events:**\n   - Frequent interactions with PowerShell and registry changes (e.g., `RegistryEvent`) suggest **system modification** or **configuration changes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs exhibit **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malicious activity**, including:\n- **Privilege escalation** (admin-level scheduled tasks).\n- **Persistence mechanisms** (scheduled tasks).\n- **Code execution** via PowerShell and .NET.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands** (e.g., check for unauthorized user activity, lateral movement, or initial compromise).\n2. **Analyze the system for hidden processes or payloads** (e.g., check if `calc.exe` is being used as a decoy).\n3. **Check for other suspicious scheduled tasks** on the system.\n4. **Monitor for .NET-based attacks** (e.g., PowerShell remoting, WMI, or other code execution methods).\n\n**This batch of logs is a strong indicator of a potential security incident and requires immediate forensic analysis.**"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each event to spot any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Windows Defender uses those DLLs. But then there's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be a red flag, like a temporary file used for malicious purposes.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. Not sure yet. Then, looking at the command_line in one of the processes, there's a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon, with the highest privileges for Administrators. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate tool, but using it in a scheduled task with elevated permissions could be part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. If this is normal user activity, maybe not, but repeated registry changes could indicate something trying to modify Chrome's behavior, maybe for persistence or data exfiltration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe later events have \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process information. That's concerning because it might indicate remote code execution attempts, but since the process is None, maybe the logs are incomplete or the events are not properly captured. However, having 20+ such events in a row seems like a potential attack vector, especially if they're part of a brute force or automated exploit.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell scheduled task creation is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. The repeated remote command executions could be part of an attack. Even though some events might be benign (like Defender DLLs), the combination of creating a scheduled task with high privileges and multiple remote command attempts raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some events might be false positives, but the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges for Administrators, temporary files created\/deleted in user directories, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior attempting persistence and remote access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses WMI. However, taskschd.dll is a system file, so maybe that's normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is common, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe part of normal operations.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Tasks directory called 'unidade_comum'. That path seems a bit odd. Usually, Tasks under System32 is where scheduled tasks are, but 'unidade_comum' doesn't ring a bell. Maybe a typo or something malicious?\n\nThen, there's an entry with no process executing a remote command. That's concerning. If the process is None, it might indicate a command executed without a clear parent process, which could be a sign of something bad, like a remote code execution or a vulnerability exploit.\n\nPowerShell creating files in the user's AppData and Downloads folders. That's normal for some scripts, but if there are unexpected files, it could be malicious. However, the filenames here like 'entrada_principal.txt' don't seem obviously malicious.\n\nThere are a lot of registry changes by chrome.exe. Chrome is a common target for malware, but if it's just normal operations, maybe not. However, repeated registry changes could be an indicator of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe is normal, but if it's querying suspicious domains, that's a problem. However, the log doesn't mention the domain, so I can't tell.\n\nThe winlogbeat entries are about creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating config files might be part of its setup. But the same file path is mentioned twice, which might be normal.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious points are the \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process involved, which could indicate a potential exploit. Also, the file created in the Tasks directory might be a scheduled task set up by an attacker. The repeated registry changes by svchost and chrome could be part of persistence or configuration changes. However, some of these events might be benign. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, 2) File creation in system-critical directories (e.g., 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\unidade_comum'), 3) Repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, which may indicate persistence attempts or configuration changes. While some events appear legitimate, the combination of these indicators suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
