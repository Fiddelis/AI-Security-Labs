While this could be legitimate behavior, the repetition is unusual.\n- This is followed by two events involving powershell.exe being accessed, which could indicate command execution.\n- Lastly, there's an event showing whoami.exe creation, which might suggest enumeration of system details.\n- The sequence and nature of these events make it relevant for investigation despite no file-related data."}
