The filenames follow a pattern that suggests they're related to Excel's offline editing feature (`excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_*.js`).\n\n3. **Issue**: The fact that these files are being recreated repeatedly might indicate an issue with the application's ability to write or access these files correctly, possibly due to permission issues, file corruption, or a software bug.\n\nTo troubleshoot this:\n\n1. Check if there are any permissions-related issues preventing `SDXHelper.exe` from accessing or writing to these files.\n2. Try repairing your Office installation via the Programs and Features control panel.\n3. If the issue persists, consider contacting Microsoft Support for further assistance."}

These files are being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" subfolder of the \"PackageResources\" folder, which is located in the Microsoft Office solution package for user 'fiddelis'.\n\n4. **Frequency**: There are multiple logs for each file, suggesting that these files might be recreated or accessed repeatedly.\n\nHere's what you can do to investigate this further:\n\n- Check if there are any ongoing updates or installations related to Microsoft Office on your system.\n- Monitor the size and usage of these created files over time to see if they're growing or being used.\n- Consider running a malware scan, as repeated creation of unknown files could potentially indicate malicious activity (though it's more likely that this is a normal process in this context).\n- Review any recent changes to your system, such as software installations or Windows updates, which might have triggered these file creations."}
