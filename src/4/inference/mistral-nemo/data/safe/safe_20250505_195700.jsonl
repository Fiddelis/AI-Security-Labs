{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"**Classification:**\n\n- **Type:** Batch of JSON-like objects\n- **Count:** 22 objects\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAll the provided JSON-like objects follow a consistent structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"winlog\": {\n    \"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\",\n    \"process\": {\n      \"name\": \"Solitaire.exe\"\n    },\n    \"file\": {\n      \"path\": \"<path_to_file>\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **Process Name:** The process name is consistently `\"Solitaire.exe\"`.\n- **Task:** All tasks are `\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"`.\n- **File Path:** The file paths vary, but they all fall into the following pattern:\n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\cache\\dlfiles\\globaldata\\<category>\\<sub-category>\\<pack>\\<archive>\n  ```\n\n**JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT MARKING AS SUSPICIOUS:**\n\nWhile the consistent structure and process name could indicate a potential security concern (such as malware or unwanted software), the fact that all files are being created within the context of Microsoft Solitaire (a built-in Windows game) makes this behavior less suspicious. Additionally, there's no indication of any malicious activities like data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or privileged access abuse in the given logs.\n\n**JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT MARKING AS SUSPICIOUS (CONT.):**\n\n- The files are all being created within Microsoft Solitaire's cache and data folders.\n- The files' paths suggest they relate to game assets, configurations, or advertisements (`<category>` includes `dlc_sgi`, `advertisement`, etc.).\n- There's no evidence of file creation outside the expected scope for this application."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's my assessment:\n\n**Classification:**\n- The events are primarily related to file creation and DNS queries, with all files being created by the \"Solitaire.exe\" process.\n\n**Events Breakdown:**\n\n1. **File Creation (80%)**\n   - These events account for 80% of the total logs and involve the creation of various archive files (.archive) in the same directory structure.\n   - The filenames are hashed, suggesting these could be game assets or updates related to Solitaire.\n\n2. **DNS Query (20%)**\n   - The remaining 20% consist of a single DNS query event by \"Solitaire.exe\". This suggests that the application might be making network requests.\n\n**Potential Threat\/Anomaly:**\n- While these events seem normal for a game application like Solitaire, the high number of archive files being created could potentially indicate a malicious activity, such as:\n  - **Data Exfiltration:** If these archives are being sent out via network requests (as indicated by the DNS query), it might suggest data is being exfiltrated.\n  - **Malware Distribution:** Alternatively, if these archives contain malicious code or files, they could be used to distribute malware.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Further investigation is needed to determine the content of these archive files and whether they are being sent over the network.\n- If possible, monitor network traffic for outgoing data to identify any unusual communication patterns.\n- Consider running these files through a virus scanner or submitting them to a threat intelligence platform for analysis.\n- Review system logs for any other related events or anomalies.\n\n**Confidence Level:** Medium. While the high number of archive file creations is notable, there's no immediate evidence of malicious activity."}
