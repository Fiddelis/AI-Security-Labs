{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the activities that occurred on your system:\n\n1. **Process Creation and Image Loading:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe`: Created a process and loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n   - `svchost.exe` (multiple instances): Performed several registry operations.\n   - `winlogbeat.exe`: Created processes and manipulated `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files.\n   - `notepad.exe`, `Calculator.exe`: Made registry changes.\n   - `chrome.exe`: Loaded various DLLs (`urlmon.dll`), performed registry operations, and made DNS queries.\n   - `smartscreen.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`: Loaded system DLLs like `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`.\n\n2. **File Creation:**\n   - `setup.exe`: Created a temporary file (`b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`) in the Windows System Temp directory.\n   - Multiple instances of `winlogbeat.exe` created `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files in the user's Downloads folder.\n\nNo significant security threats were immediately apparent, but some observations:\n\n- There are multiple instances of registry operations by various processes. While this is common for system processes like `svchost.exe`, excessive or unknown changes could indicate malicious activity.\n- The creation of temporary files and frequent file manipulation by `winlogbeat.exe` suggests that it might be actively running and updating its configuration file.\n\nTo further investigate, consider the following steps:\n1. Monitor registry activities to identify any suspicious or unusual modifications.\n2. Check if there are any unknown or unauthorized processes running on your system.\n3. Scan for malware using up-to-date antivirus software.\n4. Review firewall and network traffic logs to detect any anomalies."}
