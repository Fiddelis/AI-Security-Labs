These operations create files in the following directory:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n   - The files created are JavaScript files (`.js`) with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.\n   - One event is a `Security Group Management` operation, but the process involved (`SDXHelper.exe`) and the file path (null) suggest this might be related to permissions or group membership changes triggered by the other operations.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The repeated creation of JavaScript files by `SDXHelper.exe` instances suggests a scripting activity. This could indicate either normal operation (e.g., Microsoft Office updating its resources) or potential malicious behavior (e.g., malware dropping payloads).\n   - To determine if this is normal or malicious, consider the following:\n     1. Check if these files are part of legitimate Microsoft Office updates or extensions.\n     2. Scan the created files with up-to-date antivirus software to check for any threats.\n     3. Monitor behavior: If the files are created and remain unchanged most of the time but occasionally get executed, it could be a sign of malicious activity.\n   - The `Security Group Management` event might suggest that permissions or group memberships were changed as part of these operations.\n\nGiven the nature of the events (multiple JavaScript file creations), it's recommended to investigate further to determine if this is normal behavior or a potential threat."}

The `.min.js` files are likely minified JavaScript files used by these scripts.\n\n2. **Chrome Registry and Dns Queries**\n   There are several events where `chrome.exe` is either setting registry values or performing DNS queries. These are typical behaviors of the Google Chrome web browser:\n   - Setting registry values could indicate that Chrome is installing updates, changing settings, or syncing data.\n   - Performing DNS queries is normal for a web browser as it resolves domain names to IP addresses.\n\n3. **Excel File Download**\n   There's an event where `chrome.exe` creates file streams for the following Excel file:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx:Zone.Identifier\n   ```\n   This indicates that you've downloaded an Excel file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" using Google Chrome.\n\nIn summary, these logs show typical behaviors of Office Scripts updates and Google Chrome's operations during a browsing session with file downloads.
