The batch starts with 'whoami.exe', which is often used for reconnaissance purposes. This is followed by PowerShell and cmd.exe processes creating registry keys suggesting they are setting up persistence mechanisms ('REG ADD' commands). Additionally, multiple processes (cmd.exe and reg.exe) accessing or modifying registry keys is unusual activity. Finally, the appearance of 'winlogbeat.exe', which is related to security monitoring tools like ELK stack, suggests the attacker might be attempting to hide their activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
