However, without additional context or the full logs, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose or potential maliciousness of these activities.\n\nTo gain more insights, consider looking into:\n- The content of the deleted ZIP file (`entrada_principal.zip`)\n- The changes made to the registry\n- The script executed by PowerShell (if available)\n- Other processes or files created around this time"}
