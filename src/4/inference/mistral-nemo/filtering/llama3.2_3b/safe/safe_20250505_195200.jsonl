This suggests that the process creating these files has sufficient permissions to write to this location, but it might be worth checking if there are any permission-related issues.\n\n3. **Process Involved**: The `SDXHelper.exe` process is responsible for creating these files. You might want to investigate what this process does and why it's repeatedly trying to create the same files.\n\n4. **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n   - Check if there's a configuration or logic error in the process that's causing it to create duplicate files.\n   - Ensure that the files aren't being used by another application or service, which might cause them to be recreated.\n   - Review the process responsible for creating these files (`SDXHelper.exe`) and its related configurations to identify any potential issues.\n   - If you find no obvious reasons, consider reaching out to Microsoft support or their developer community for further assistance.\n\n5. **Potential Temporary Workaround**: As a temporary measure, you could try setting up a script or task scheduler that periodically deletes the duplicate files (if they're not in use) to prevent them from piling up.
