These files are being created in the following location:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n     ```\n   - The filenames follow this pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.\n   - These events are happening frequently, suggesting that either these files are being updated repeatedly or a large number of unique files are being created.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set Event (Rule: RegistryEvent)**\n   - A process named `chrome.exe` sets a registry value. This could be related to Google Chrome browser settings or extensions.\n   - Since the event doesn't provide the specific registry key or value, it's not possible to determine what exact change was made.\n\n3. **Process Information**\n   - The processes involved in these events are:\n     1. `SDXHelper.exe`: This is likely a helper process used by Microsoft Office for various tasks like add-ins, updates, etc.\n     2. `chrome.exe`: This is the Google Chrome web browser process.\n\n4. **Potential Concern**\n   - The frequent creation of these JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) might indicate unwanted or malicious activity (like a form of malware), especially if they're being created outside of regular software updates.\n   - It's recommended to investigate further using tools like Microsoft Defender, Windows Security, or other antivirus\/anti-malware solutions.\n\nAs always, it's crucial to monitor these types of activities closely and respond appropriately based on your system's security policies. If you suspect malware, consider running a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus software."}

In this case, it's related to the `EXCEL.EXE` process, suggesting that Microsoft Excel might have been opened or updated.\n\n3. **File Creation by SDXHelper.exe (Again):**\n   - After the registry event, another `.js` file was created in the directory:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n\nThis sequence of events suggests that Microsoft Office (possibly Excel) was opened or updated, which triggered the creation and update of related language files. These activities are not uncommon for office suite applications and do not appear to be malicious based on the information provided. However, if you're still concerned about these activities, I would recommend running a full system scan using reputable antivirus software."}
