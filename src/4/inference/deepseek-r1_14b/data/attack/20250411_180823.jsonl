{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. These could be normal browser activities, like loading websites, but repeated network connections might raise an eyebrow, though maybe not necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nThen there are events involving processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe accessing registry values or other processes. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a red flag if it's running unusual commands or being executed from unexpected places.\n\nLooking further, there are several cmd.exe instances with command lines that create scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines show tasks being created that execute calc.exe on logon or startup. This is concerning because creating scheduled tasks to run executables can be a tactic used by malware for persistence. Also, calc.exe being executed through these tasks doesn't seem normal and could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where svchost.exe is setting registry values and creating files in the Task directory. Svchost.exe is typically a legitimate Windows process, but it's often exploited by malware to hide their activities. The fact that it's making changes to the registry and creating new files might be signs of tampering.\n\nThe events also show ImageLoad tasks for urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll from various processes like Calculator.exe, schtasks.exe, etc. These DLLs are standard in Windows, but repeated loading by different processes could indicate suspicious behavior or attempts to bypass certain security measures.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of schtasks.exe to create new scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on system startup or logon is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Malware often uses such techniques to ensure persistence across reboots and to maintain access to the system. The combination of cmd.exe executing these commands, along with svchost.exe making changes, adds to the suspicion.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think this batch of events is definitely interesting for investigation because they collectively suggest that there might be unauthorized or malicious activities happening on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe, along with svchost.exe modifying registry values and files, indicate potential malicious activity for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, each line represents a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The winlog key contains information about tasks like Registry value sets, Pipe Created, File created, Image loaded, etc., along with some rule identifiers. \n\nI'll start by categorizing each event to see if there's any pattern or concerning activity.\n\n1. **svchost.exe**: This is a known system process that's often used by malware because it's a legitimate Windows process. However, in this case, the task is 'Registry value set'. That could be normal or suspicious depending on what's being changed. But since there's no other info, I'll note it.\n\n2. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe**: This is related to the Windows shell and UI components. Again, a legitimate process. The event here is also a Registry value set. Not immediately suspicious unless it's doing something unusual, but in isolation, not a red flag.\n\n3. **Calculator.exe**: Another legitimate system app. Event is a Registry change. Unless it's modifying protected or sensitive registry keys, this might not be an issue. But again, the batch includes multiple such events.\n\n4. **powershell.exe**: PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event with powershell.exe has a task 'Registry value set', which could be malicious but also could be part of normal administration. Then there's another event where it accesses something via 'ProcessAccess' rule, which might indicate some form of process injection or lateral movement.\n\n5. **chrome.exe**: Chrome is a web browser, and it's known to load various DLLs and interact with the registry for things like extensions or settings. There are multiple events here showing Registry value sets and Image loaded tasks. However, one event shows 'File created' at a specific path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_ativo.txt. Creating files in user directories isn't inherently bad, but it's worth noting.\n\n6. **winlogbeat.exe**: This is likely an agent or service for log management. The file created event points to a .yml.new file, which might be part of its configuration or data collection process. Not suspicious on its own.\n\n7. **whoami.exe**: This is a command-line tool used to identify the user and their permissions. The command line here is straightforward, pointing to the system32 directory, so nothing unusual there. The task is 'Process Create', which is normal for executable runs.\n\nNow, looking at the overall batch: there are multiple Registry value sets from various processes, especially chrome.exe. This could be part of legitimate operations like installing extensions or modifying settings, but it's also a common tactic for malware to persistence by adding registry entries. The file creation events in user directories (like unidade_ativo.txt) might be part of data exfiltration or dropping files as part of malicious activities.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe is a red flag because it's often used for scripting attacks and can execute commands that are hard to detect. The 'ProcessAccess' tasks could indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes, possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.\n\nAdditionally, the high number of RegistryEvent tasks from different processes could be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence across reboots. Malware often uses registry modifications to ensure it starts up after system restarts.\n\nWhile individual events might not raise alarms, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The multiple suspicious activities like using powershell.exe for process access, creating files in user directories, and numerous registry modifications are concerning.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the system log events indicates that while individual events may not be inherently suspicious, the combination points to potential malicious activity. Key findings include:\n\n- **Multiple Registry Modifications**: Several processes, especially Chrome, are making changes to the registry. While this can be legitimate, it's a common tactic for malware persistence.\n  \n- **Use of PowerShell**: The presence of PowerShell with 'ProcessAccess' tasks suggests possible scripting or command execution, often used in attacks for privilege escalation.\n\n- **File Creation Events**: Files created in user directories could indicate data exfiltration or malicious drops.\n\n- **Legitimate Processes with Suspicious Activities**: Tools like whoami.exe are running normally, but other processes like svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe making registry changes warrant closer monitoring.\n\nOverall, the batch shows a pattern that aligns with potential cyber threats, such as persistence mechanisms and lateral movement. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and mitigate risks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The combination of multiple Registry modifications, use of PowerShell for process access, file creation in user directories, and legitimate processes making suspicious changes suggests potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
