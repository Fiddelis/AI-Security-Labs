{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. So, first, I'll go through each event one by one and note down what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are all from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because Chrome is a common browser and often makes network connections. But then, looking at the later events, there's a switch to powershell.exe activities. \n\nI see that powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines. The commands look like they're using WebClient to download files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. For example, one of them is downloading LICENSE.txt files under different paths like modulo_padrao.txt and others. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell scripts are often used in malicious activities due to their scripting capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are being created and then deleted in the TEMP folder. The first time, a file __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. This might be an attempt to test if script execution policies are enforced or to avoid detection by cleaning up after themselves.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with similar command lines, each downloading different files from various GitHub repositories. The fact that it's using raw.githubusercontent.com suggests they're fetching code directly, which could be malicious scripts. \n\nAlso, the events show process creation, registry access, and image loading for mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components. This is typical when PowerShell loads certain modules or runs scripts, but combined with the file downloads, it might indicate that something malicious is being executed.\n\nAnother point is that the command lines are obfuscated within curly braces and escaped quotes, which is a common technique to bypass simple monitoring tools or to make analysis harder. \n\nThe events stop at \"Provider Lifecycle\" task after some of the powershell.exe commands, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. It might indicate that the process was terminated or that something triggered an alert.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of downloading files using PowerShell from various GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory, creating and deleting script files, and possibly executing them. This combination suggests potential malicious activity like script injection, file downloads that could be malware components, and attempts to cover tracks by deleting temporary files.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because sometimes legitimate scripts can do similar things, but given the repeated pattern of downloading from GitHub and using obfuscated command lines, it's a strong indicator of something suspicious. The confidence is high enough to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions attempting to download files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory, with evidence of file creation and deletion, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events from various processes on a Windows machine. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but it's often used in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Each time powershell is called with command lines, especially ones that download files from URLs, that's a red flag. For example, the command line includes downloading files like LICENSE.txt from GitHub repositories. The fact that different processes are trying to access these files and create them in temporary directories could indicate malicious activity because attackers often use such techniques to drop malware or exfiltrate data.\n\nThen there's the repeated Registry value sets by chrome.exe. While Chrome can modify registry entries, multiple such events might be unusual unless it's part of a legitimate update process. However, since these are all under RegistryEvent and from the same process, I need to consider if this is normal behavior for the user or if it's an attempt to persistence or change system configurations in a way that's not typical.\n\nLooking at other entries like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe also accessing registry values could be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the powershell activity, they might contribute to an overall concerning pattern. The MpDefenderCoreService.exe network connection is particularly interesting because it's related to Windows Defender; if this process makes unexpected network connections, it might indicate tampering or attempts to disable antivirus features.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple file creation events by winlogbeat.exe, which could be part of log management software, but again, the frequency and combination with other events make me cautious. The download activities and the use of temporary files named things like \"estrutura_temporario.txt\" might suggest that some form of data extraction or malicious payload is being written to disk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances downloading files from GitHub, registry modifications by various processes, network activity from security-related services, and file creations in user directories. These could be signs of a potential attack chain where an adversary is trying to establish persistence, download tools, and cover their tracks. The high number of events related to system configuration changes (Registry) and file operations increases the suspicion.\n\nI'm not sure if all these activities are malicious, but their combination makes it more likely that something's amiss rather than just normal user activity or legitimate software updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes downloading files from GitHub repositories into temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is often used for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might be a red flag. Also, cmd.exe is being used with commands like SCHTASKS to delete tasks and REG DELETE to remove registry entries. These actions can be part of an attempt to clean up traces after malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see things like \"\/Delete \/TN spawn\" which suggests that someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks named \"spawn\". This could mean they're trying to hide their activities by deleting any evidence left behind by previous commands. Similarly, using REG DELETE on registry keys under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run indicates an attempt to remove entries from the startup folder, which might be used to maintain persistence.\n\nThere are also instances where svchost.exe and conhost.exe are involved in setting registry values or objects. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be abused by malware to hide its activities. The frequent RegistryEvent tasks could mean that something is trying to modify system configurations, possibly to gain access or persistence.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe with command lines pointing to system32. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but in some cases, it can be part of token manipulation techniques by attackers to elevate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll are loaded. These are legitimate Windows files, but their loading in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate that malicious processes are being executed under the guise of normal operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of events that suggest attempts to delete scheduled tasks, remove registry entries for persistence, and possibly hide traces using legitimate tools. The repetitive use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with specific commands raises concern about potential malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including deletion of scheduled tasks, registry entries, and use of command-line tools indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events show powershell.exe being executed and some provider lifecycle tasks. This is somewhat normal since PowerShell is a common tool. However, the repeated occurrences make me wonder about their purposeâ€”could it be part of a script or something malicious?\n\nNext, there are several registry value sets from powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be tricky because they're often used by malware for persistence. I need to check if these writes are legitimate or if they might be creating new keys that shouldn't exist.\n\nThen, I notice multiple image loads from powershell.exe, including mscoree.dll and related .NET files. While these are legitimate system components, their loading in the context of PowerShell could indicate script execution, which is common but sometimes used maliciously.\n\nThere's a file creation event for a PowerShell script test file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. This seems suspicious because such files are often used by attackers to bypass policies or execute commands that might otherwise be restricted. The fact that it's created and then deleted shortly after raises red flags about potential malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation in the StartupProfileData directory. This is a standard location for PowerShell profile data, so that might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother event shows conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is often used to host console windows and isn't inherently malicious, but paired with powershell.exe activity, it could be part of a larger script execution or command line manipulation.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated PowerShell executions, registry writes, and the creation\/deletion of a script file are concerning signs. These behaviors can indicate potential malicious activities like script-based attacks or attempts to establish persistence. While individual events might seem benign, the combination suggests a possible security event that warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including registry modifications and file creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. The fact that it's appearing several times might be a red flag, but sometimes legitimate scripts also use Powershell.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see some like \"powershell.exe & {}\", which doesn't seem to do much on its own. However, the repeated use could indicate persistence or multiple stages of an attack. Also, there are entries where Powershell is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. Registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often change system configurations to maintain access.\n\nAnother point is that there's a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\". The naming suggests it's a script related to Powershell policies, but creating and deleting such files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or to test if certain scripts are allowed.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances where other tools like whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being used. Whoami is typically innocent as it just shows user info, but when combined with other activities, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nThe events also show multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from Powershell. This might indicate that the process is starting up or shutting down, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of a larger script execution.\n\nConsidering all these together, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated use of Powershell with various activities like registry changes and file operationsâ€”could point to potential malicious behavior. However, without more context or evidence of actual exploit attempts or data exfiltration, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the multiple flags raised by the Powershell activity and related system changes, even though each event alone isn't conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and creating\/deleting files in the Temp directory, which may indicate malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an entry where Calculator.exe sets a registry value. That seems normal because many system tools interact with the registry. Then, powershell.exe creates a pipe and sets registry values. Powershell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye on how it's being used here.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is involved in multiple eventsâ€”creating pipes and setting registry values repeatedly. That's a bit odd because Chrome shouldn't be making so many registry changes unless there's some extension or script doing that. It could indicate something suspicious, especially if these actions are part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often used in command-line tools and sometimes by malware for persistence. I'll note this as another potential red flag.\n\nLooking further down, whoami.exe is executed with a standard command line. While not inherently malicious, it's worth considering the contextâ€”it might be part of legitimate user activity or could be used to gather system information by an attacker.\n\nA more concerning event appears: powershell.exe with a command line that includes removing a file in the TEMP directory. Specifically, they're trying to delete \"objeto_principal.zip\" but ignoring errors if it doesn't exist. This kind of file deletion is often seen in malware trying to clean up traces of their activities or remove files dropped during an attack.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, the frequency might indicate that Powershell is executing scripts or downloading content, which could be malicious if not authorized.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry modifications, pipe creations, file deletions in TEMP, and repeated ImageLoad events from Powershell suggests possible malicious activity. The consistent use of Powershell with suspicious command lines and actions like deleting files aligns with tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence or erase evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing registry modifications, file deletions in TEMP directory, and loading various DLLs suggest potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell with suspicious command lines and actions like deleting files without error handling could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and decide if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe loading an image, specifically MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender often loads such modules. The next two events show file creation and deletion in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. This looks like it could be related to testing script policies, but I'm not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is used with command lines removing files from the Temp directory, using Remove-Item cmdlets. The files being deleted have names like tarefa_base.zip and others ending with .zip or .txt. This seems repetitive, deleting multiple files. It might be part of a script cleaning up after itself, but it's worth noting that PowerShell is often used for malicious activities.\n\nThere are events where chrome.exe loads images and sets registry values, which is standard behavior for the browser. The conhost.exe event setting a registry value also doesn't raise any immediate red flags.\n\nLooking at whoami.exe being executed, that's usually harmless unless it's part of a larger sequence to gather information. But here, it's standalone.\n\nThe process accesses and creates events don't seem unusual on their own but might indicate something when combined with other activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe deleting files in Temp could be part of malicious activity, like a script attempting to remove evidence or files used in an attack. The specific file paths and the use of Remove-Item cmdlets are common tactics in cyberattacks to cover tracks. The fact that there are multiple such events with different filenames suggests a systematic cleanup, which is often seen in malware.\n\nWhile some events might look normal individually, the overall pattern raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities including file deletions and registry changes, suggesting possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for system administration but can also be abused for malicious activities. Looking at the command lines, several of them have commands like Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\" suggests that they're trying to remove a file without any error messages if it doesn't exist. This could be an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which isn't unusual but might indicate script execution or malicious activity. The fact that multiple files in the TEMP directory are being deleted using similar commands makes me think this could be part of a larger script designed to remove evidence.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary files. For instance, a file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\" is created and then immediately deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a way to avoid detection or to test if certain scripts are allowed.\n\nThere's also an event where 'whoami.exe' is run, which usually retrieves user information. While this isn't inherently malicious, it could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation tactics if combined with other activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving 'winlogbeat.exe', which I think is related to log management. However, since the main focus seems to be on PowerShell activities, especially around file deletions and temporary files, this might not add much but could indicate someone monitoring logs or trying to cover their tracks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's concerning because multiple attempts are being made to delete files in a consistent manner using PowerShell. The combination of deleting specific TEMP files, creating and deleting test scripts, accessing registry values, and running whoami.exe suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at evading detection or cleaning up after an attack.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole is interesting because it shows a pattern that could be indicative of malicious activity.

While whoami itself isn't harmful, its execution might indicate privilege escalation or information gathering, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so unless there's something unusual about the path, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions and whoami runs could indicate potential malicious behavior, especially if they're part of an attack chain.
