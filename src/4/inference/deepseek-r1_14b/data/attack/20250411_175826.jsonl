{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries. That's normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups when browsing the web. So, those might just be regular user activity and probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to look closer at what's happening here. The first few powershell.exe entries show process access and registry changes. That could indicate scripting or configuration changes, which might be normal admin work but also potentially malicious.\n\nI see some command lines in the powershell.exe events. For example, one of them has a script that sets LastWriteTime on files using Get-ChildItem and loops through each item to change the timestamp. This kind of activity could be part of data tampering or attempts to cover tracks by altering file metadata. It's concerning because modifying timestamps can help hide malicious activities.\n\nThere are also file creation and deletion events for a temporary .ps1 script in the user's AppData directory. Creating and then deleting a script file might suggest that the script is being executed in memory, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. This could be an indicator of malware or malicious scripts running.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are related to the .NET framework. That in itself isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger malicious process, like loading malicious libraries or obfuscating code execution.\n\nAnother event involves RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes. Runtime Broker is typically associated with Windows User Account Control (UAC) and managing elevate privileges. While legitimate software might interact with the registry, sudden changes could be worth investigating to ensure they're not part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThere's also an entry from notepad.exe modifying the registry. Notepad isn't known for making registry changes on its own, so this could indicate that it was used as a vehicle for malicious activity or perhaps a script was run through it.\n\nOverall, while some individual events might look benign, the combination raises red flags. The repeated use of PowerShell with unusual command lines, file tampering, in-memory script execution, and unexpected process interactions all point towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command-line arguments, file creation\/deletion of temporary scripts indicative of in-memory attacks, and unauthorized registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a bunch of log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. Most of the initial entries are PowerShell commands. They're using Get-ChildItem to modify LastWriteTime of various files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which looks like an attempt to change file timestamps. This could be suspicious because altering timestamps is a common tactic in malware to hide their tracks.\n\n2. There are several instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values and accessing the Registry. SvcHost is a legitimate process, but it's often used by malicious actors to run code. The repeated Registry modifications might indicate something is wrong.\n\n3. A few events involve Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems unusual. Typically, Calculator wouldn't need such DLLs, so this could be an indicator of tampering or a backdoor.\n\n4. There are some instances where normal processes like conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are accessing the Registry. While these can be legitimate, the frequency might raise flags.\n\n5. The later events show Chrome making multiple Registry changes. Although Chrome does interact with the Registry for settings, so many entries could be concerning but not necessarily malicious unless they're out of the ordinary pattern.\n\n6. There's a PowerShell process creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which is non-interactive. This might be setting up persistence mechanisms or running scripts at startup without user interaction.\n\n7. The presence of winlogbeat.exe writing to its data directory seems normal unless it's part of an attack framework, but that's less likely here.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity: PowerShell command-line activities altering file timestamps, svchost and Calculator processes accessing the Registry unusually, and unexpected file creations by legitimate-sounding processes. These could all be indicators of a breach or APT activities trying to maintain persistence and cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell command executions attempting to modify file timestamps, which may indicate tampering or malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first log is from chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings. The next few events are similar—chrome.exe again, so nothing unusual there. Then there's an event where chrome.exe loads a DLL file, specifically amsi.dll. Hmm, that's interesting because amsi is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface. But wait, Chrome might load legitimate DLLs, so maybe it's just part of its operation.\n\nAnother event has chrome.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That sounds suspicious because why would Chrome need to interact with Defender components? Or maybe it's a false positive sinceMpOAV is related to antivirus functionality. I should look into whether Chrome normally loads these DLLs or if this could indicate some malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely setting up logging files for Windows events, so that's normal.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a new text file named unidade_logico.txt. Powershell is often used for scripting and can be malicious, but creating a file isn't inherently bad—it could just be legitimate script execution. However, the filename seems generic, which might not raise too many flags on its own.\n\nLooking at the remaining events, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe setting registry values without any associated files. This repetition makes me think it's part of Chrome's regular operations, especially if it's updating settings or extensions.\n\nPutting this all together: While there are a few points that might seem suspicious, like Chrome loading Defender-related DLLs and the creation of a file by Powershell, these could be legitimate activities. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior across the batch as a whole. The logs don't show any unusual patterns, such as repeated failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected processes. Therefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level because there are no strong indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal activities such as Chrome interacting with the registry and loading DLLs, winlogbeat setting up files, and Powershell creating a file. These events do not indicate malicious behavior when considered together.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
