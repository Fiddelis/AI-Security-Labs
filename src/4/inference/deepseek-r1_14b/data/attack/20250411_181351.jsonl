{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe running, which is usually harmless but might be part of some script to gather information.\n\nNext, svchost.exe accessing the registry stands out because svchost is often associated with services, but it can sometimes be used by malware for persistence. Then, powershell.exe again, this time setting a registry value. That's another potentially malicious activity since attackers often use the registry for persistence or to drop files.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating new processes and accessing images like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These might be part of normal operations, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they could indicate something more serious.\n\nThe latter half of the logs shows several powershell.exe commands that execute a script to take screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory. This behavior is unusual because it's capturing the screen without user interaction, which can be a sign of malicious activity like screenshoting for reconnaissance or data theft.\n\nPutting all these events together: multiple powershell processes accessing the registry, creating new processes with suspicious command lines, loading various .NET framework components (which could be part of obfuscation techniques), and taking screenshots. This combination is concerning because it shows signs of possible unauthorized access, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch definitely looks interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because there are multiple red flags pointing towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, modifying the registry, and executing scripts that capture screenshots. These activities could indicate unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve capturing the screen and saving it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because taking screenshots can be part of data exfiltration or surveillance activities. The different filenames like \"estrutura_ativo.png\" and others suggest multiple captures, which might indicate an attempt to collect visual information from the system.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1). This could be an attempt to test if scripts are allowed or to remove evidence after execution. The fact that it's created and immediately deleted raises red flags about potential malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are entries where powershell.exe interacts with the registry (Registry value set) and loads specific DLLs (Image loaded). Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or installing backdoors, which are common in malware. The fact that this happens multiple times across different processes adds to the concern.\n\nThere's also an event involving Execute a Remote Command without any associated file. This could mean that powershell is being used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a classic sign of remote access tools or command-and-control communication.\n\nOther entries involve processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe modifying registry values. While these might seem benign, the combination with other suspicious activities suggests they could be part of a larger attack vector. Additionally, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe making registry changes is unusual; typically, these are standard system processes that don't interact directly with the registry in such ways unless something is manipulating them.\n\nThe presence of multiple Pipe Created events from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe indicates possible inter-process communication, which might be a way for malware to hide or exfiltrate data through legitimate channels.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines, file creation\/deletion patterns, registry modifications, and remote command executions strongly suggest that this batch is indicative of malicious activity. The variety of events points towards possible persistence mechanisms, data collection, and communication activities typical in an attack scenario.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes capturing screenshots, creating\/deleting files, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events have the same process name, which is chrome.exe. The tasks vary a bit—there are registry value sets, DNS queries, and image loads.\n\nFirst, multiple registry writes from Chrome could be normal since browsers interact with the registry for settings. But so many in one batch might warrant a closer look to see if it's within usual behavior.\n\nThe DNS query is also something Chrome does regularly when browsing, especially if navigating to new sites or resolving domains.\n\nLooking at the image loads, both are system files—amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate components used for anti-malware scanning and by Windows Defender. This seems normal unless there's a deviation from usual patterns.\n\nConsidering all these together, while each event is somewhat routine, having several similar events in quick succession might indicate something suspicious like a script or tool trying to mimic Chrome's behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. The confidence level isn't too high because the activities themselves aren't inherently malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Chrome browser activity including registry modifications, DNS queries, and loading legitimate system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
