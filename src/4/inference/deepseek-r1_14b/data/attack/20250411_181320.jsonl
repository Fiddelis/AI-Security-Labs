{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial logs, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome often makes network requests and DNS lookups. So, these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I notice several events involving powershell.exe. The first time it appears is a Process Create event when whoami.exe runs. That's followed by multiple Process Access and Registry value set events from powershell.exe. This could be concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities like script execution or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several Image Load events involving mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET framework. While this might seem normal, in the context of multiple other PowerShell activities, it could indicate that the process is loading libraries as part of a larger script execution.\n\nThere's also a File Create event for a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1, which is immediately deleted. Creating and then deleting a script file could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence quickly. This behavior raises red flags as it might be part of a malicious payload execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events from PowerShell instances with specific command lines. The command line contains commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse, which are typically used for directory listings but can also be part of more nefarious activities like data exfiltration or file traversal attacks.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of these events across multiple logs suggests a possible script running in the background. The combination of creating\/deleting files, accessing registry values, and loading various DLLs points towards potential malicious activity, possibly an attempt to execute code with elevated privileges or gather system information.\n\nMoreover, the use of multiple Process Creates and Accesses on powershell.exe is significant because attackers often abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for their activities. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a process to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, while some events individually might not seem suspicious, the accumulation across all logs—especially the repeated and varied actions from powershell.exe involving script execution, file manipulation, and system queries—indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances with suspicious activities including file creation\/deletion, registry access, and script execution suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best.\n\nSo, looking through each event, the first thing I notice is that there are a lot of entries from powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts, so that could be a red flag. Also, seeing multiple events where registry values are being set might indicate something malicious since attackers often modify the registry to hide their activities or change system configurations.\n\nI also see several instances of file creation events. For example, powershell.exe creating files like 'objeto_principal.txt' and others in different paths. That could be suspicious if these files aren't supposed to be there or if they contain malicious content. \n\nThere are entries where processes like conhost.exe, svchost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe are modifying the registry as well. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process but can sometimes be used by malware. The repeated registry modifications from various processes might not be normal user activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event with powershell.exe executing some commands via command line: 'powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}'. That looks like it could be a script trying to list directories recursively, which might be part of reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nThere are also multiple User Account Management and Logon events, but since the user 'fiddelis' is involved in some file operations, maybe that's related. But the fact that many entries are from different processes accessing the same areas could indicate coordinated activity, possibly malicious.\n\nI'm a bit confused about whether these activities are normal or not. Legitimate scripts might do similar things, but the combination of powershell, registry changes, and multiple file creations raises my suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious events such as powershell.exe commands, registry modifications, and file creations which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the first line is a process named calc.exe with an ImageLoad event loading urlmon.dll from C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc.exe is a standard Windows calculator app, so maybe just running normally.\n\nThe second and third lines are both svchost.exe with RegistryEvent tasks. Svchost.exe is known to be part of system services and sometimes used by malware, but seeing registry changes alone isn't suspicious unless there's an unusual pattern or frequency.\n\nThe fourth line again is Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll file as calc.exe did earlier. Now, I'm wondering if it's related. Why would both calc.exe and Calculator.exe (which might be two different things?) load the same DLL?\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo in process names. Maybe Calculator.exe is a legitimate program, but why are they loading urlmon.dll? That file is part of Windows Update or URLMON.DLL is known for handling URLs, so it's not unusual on its own.\n\nBut seeing both calc.exe and Calculator.exe doing the same ImageLoad might be a red flag. Could this indicate some kind of script or batch process running both calculators at the same time? Or maybe they're part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nOn the other hand, if these are legitimate user actions, like someone using calculator and another program accessing URLMON.DLL for updates, it's not suspicious. But I'm not sure about the context here.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries might be trying to set registry values. Svchost is often used by legitimate services but can also be used by malware. However, without additional events like failed logins or network traffic, it's hard to say if these are malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple calc processes and Calculator.exe loading the same DLL, plus svchost making registry changes—could this indicate something? Maybe not conclusive, but enough to raise an eyebrow.\n\nI think there's a possibility of something amiss here. It doesn't scream red alert, but it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading the same DLL file, along with svchost.exe making registry changes, may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
