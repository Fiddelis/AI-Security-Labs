I'm looking at the JSONL data provided.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, seeing it appear several times could be a red flag. Looking closer, I see instances where PowerShell is accessing registry values, loading images, creating files, and deleting them. The file creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 seems suspicious because it's a temporary script file, which might indicate that something was executed temporarily.\n\nThere are also several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks for powershell.exe. These events often relate to the internal workings of PowerShell, but repeated occurrences without clear context could be concerning. Additionally, there's an event where whoami.exe is run, which can be used to gather system information—potentially useful for attackers.\n\nI notice that some command lines in the process events are empty or have \"& {}\", which doesn't provide much context on what was executed. This lack of detailed command-line arguments makes it harder to assess intent but could indicate attempts to hide activity.\n\nThe creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file, along with multiple image loads related to .NET frameworks, might suggest that some malicious code is being loaded or executed. However, since these are legitimate components, it's hard to tell without more context. The repeated \"Process Create\" events for powershell.exe also raise an eyebrow—maybe the system is running several scripts, but in a short timeframe, this could indicate something suspicious.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these actions might just be normal PowerShell usage, like script testing or configuration changes. But considering the combination of multiple process creations, registry modifications, file operations, and hidden command lines, there's enough here to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe including file creation\/deletion, registry access, and potential script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. First, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event is the process \"WMIC.exe\" loading a specific DLL file. WMIC is known for its potential malicious use, especially in command injection attacks, so this might be a red flag. It's accessing MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Platform; not sure if that's normal or not.\n\nThen, there are several events involving \"notepad.exe,\" \"cmd.exe,\" and \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. These could just be legitimate processes updating their configurations, but repeated registry writes can sometimes indicate malicious activity.\n\nI notice a pattern where multiple instances of \"chrome.exe\" are making registry changes. That's unusual because Chrome typically doesn't do that unless there's an extension or some malicious script involved. It's worth noting these events as they could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there's \"conhost.exe\" setting registry values and creating processes. Conhost is often used by attackers to hide their activities, so this adds more concern.\n\n\"Powershell.exe\" appears multiple times with process accesses and registry writes. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be misused for scripting attacks, especially when combined with other commands like deleting scheduled tasks or accessing system files. The command line in one of the events shows \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f,\" which deletes a task. This could be part of an attack to remove monitoring tools.\n\nThere's also a command using cmd.exe to copy and overwrite sethc.exe, which is a known system file. Overwriting such files can lead to persistent malware or backdoor creation. Additionally, deleting scheduled tasks with schtasks might indicate attempts to disable security features or persistence mechanisms.\n\n\"Whoami.exe\" running in the command line could be used by attackers to gather information about the current user and system, which is often a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of legitimate-looking processes (cmd.exe, chrome.exe) performing actions that are out of their normal behavior, combined with known tools like WMIC, conhost, powershell, and schtasks being used for potentially malicious tasks. These could be indicators of a cyberattack in progress, such as persistence, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of these events—especially the use of multiple vectors (WMIC, cmd.exe, powershell) performing unauthorized registry writes and process manipulations—is indicative of malicious behavior rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes including WMIC.exe, conhost.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and schtasks.exe show signs of potential malicious activities such as registry manipulation, process creation, and deletion of scheduled tasks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events from various processes on a Windows machine. The main process here is powershell.exe appearing multiple times with different command lines and tasks.\n\nFirst, I notice that most entries are about file creation, image loading, and registry changes by PowerShell. That's normal since scripts can do these things. But some command lines in the later events seem suspicious—like checking for specific batch files that don't sound legitimate, such as \"objeto_ativo_script.bat\" or \"modulo_base_script.bat\". These file names aren't standard and might be part of malicious scripts trying to check if certain tools are present.\n\nAlso, there's a mix of powershell.exe processes being created normally and some with command lines that look like they're testing for these files. This could indicate an attempt to see if previous malicious scripts were installed or if specific attack vectors exist on the system. The repeated checks might be part of an infection process or a persistence mechanism.\n\nThe fact that different PowerShell instances are interacting with various parts of the system (files, registry) without clear legitimate activity (like user-triggered scripts) makes me cautious. Malware often uses PowerShell for its capabilities to execute commands and evade detection.\n\nHowever, without seeing any direct malicious actions (like file deletions, unauthorized network connections), it's hard to be certain. But the pattern of repeated checks for non-standard files could indicate an attack in progress or preparation for one.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format to analyze. My goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are all from Windows systems because they mention processes like schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and whoami.exe. These are common system and utility processes in Windows, so they're not inherently suspicious on their own.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. SCHTASKS is a legitimate tool used to schedule tasks. Loading taskschd.dll is part of its normal operation, so that seems okay.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving svchost.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry. Svchost.exe is another standard process that hosts various services; it's not malicious by itself. Registry modifications can be normal during system operations or installations, but they might also indicate malicious activity. However, without more context on what specifically was changed in the registry, I can't say for sure.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe instances with command lines like \"\/c\". Without seeing the actual commands executed, it's hard to assess if those are suspicious. But generally, cmd is a common tool used by both legitimate users and attackers.\n\nI see powershell.exe appearing multiple times. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. The events mention \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set.\" These actions alone aren't enough to raise red flags because powershell has many legitimate uses, like system administration tasks. However, repeated accesses might warrant closer look.\n\nConhost.exe appears several times as well. Conhost is used by Windows for console applications, so it's not unusual to see it in a system log.\n\nThe whoami.exe process shows up twice, which is another standard tool often used to check user information. It’s commonly used in scripts or during troubleshooting, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the other events, chrome.exe is involved in loading various DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate components for anti-malware scanning interface and Windows Defender. So those activities are normal.\n\nI also notice multiple entries where files aren't specified (file: None). This could mean that the event doesn't involve file operations or that the information isn't captured, which is common in some log formats.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show any overtly malicious behavior. Most processes are standard and their activities are within normal operational parameters. There's a lot of registry activity and powershell use, but without specific indicators like unusual file creation or network communication, these might just be legitimate system operations or part of a script.\n\nHowever, the high frequency of certain processes (like cmd.exe and powershell.exe) could be a concern if they're outside of normal usage patterns for the system. But with the data given, I can't confirm any malicious intent. So while it's not clear-cut, I'd lean towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no concrete evidence of malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly normal system activities, with legitimate processes like schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe performing standard operations.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries are from powershell.exe. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. The events show various file operations and registry changes. For example, there's a file creation and then deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 in the Temp directory. That seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where files like elemento_padrao.txt are created. The path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads suggests it's user-specific, but without more context, I'm not sure if that's normal behavior for the system. Also, there's a command line in one of the events that checks for the existence of a .bat file and exits based on its presence. That could be part of a script checking if certain files are present before executing malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets from chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, seven such events in a row might indicate something unusual, especially if they're not typical user activity.\n\nI also see several ImageLoad tasks for .NET and Windows Defender-related DLLs. Legitimate processes often load these, but combined with the other activities, it's worth monitoring.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple events from powershell.exe doing various things—loading images, creating files, accessing registry—all within a short time frame, makes me think this could be part of an attack chain. The deletion of temporary script files and specific file checks might be steps in an attempt to execute malicious scripts without being detected.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows potentially malicious behavior using powershell.exe for file operations and registry modifications, which are common tactics in cyberattacks. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected from powershell.exe including file creation\/deletion of temporary script files, registry modifications, and image loading.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a process starting with powershell.exe executing some command lines that create and set content in .bat files. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Then, there are events where the same script creates files in various paths and deletes temporary files, which might indicate some activity trying to leave no traces.\n\nI also notice several registry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that could be harmful. Additionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events loading DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell but might be a sign of loading malicious modules.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to have inconsistent naming conventions with words like \"modulo_base\" and \"estrutura_principal,\" which aren't standard. This irregularity might suggest that these files were created by something trying to blend in or avoid detection.\n\nMoreover, there's an event where a script checks if a specific .bat file exists before exiting. This could be part of a larger script ensuring certain conditions are met, possibly for malicious execution flow.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs that might indicate suspicious activity: using PowerShell to create and delete files, modifying registry entries, loading various DLLs, and irregular file naming. While some actions could be legitimate, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior, making this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances creating files in unusual paths, deleting temporary files, modifying registry values, and loading various DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are multiple JSON objects, each representing different log entries from Windows. Each line starts with \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields.\n\nFirst, I notice that the process field is consistently 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a vector for malicious activities because it allows execution of scripts. So, any batch involving multiple powershell processes might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command_line in some entries, there are commands like \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\". These cmdlets are used to create new items (files or directories) and set their content. The paths mentioned include things like '.bat' files being created and modified. This is interesting because creating batch files can be a way for attackers to leave behind persistent scripts.\n\nIn the first event, the command line creates a .bat file using New-Item and then sets its content with Set-Content. The value written is simply 'dir', which lists directory contents. While this might seem harmless on its own, multiple such events creating various .bat files across different paths suggests some automated or script-based activity.\n\nThe winlog field shows tasks like 'Process Create', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. These are typical for process creation and DLL loading activities. The image loaded from C:\\Windows\\System32\\mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework might indicate that powershell is executing code or running scripts which require these components.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repetition of similar command lines across multiple events. Each creates a new .bat file in different directories, but all follow a pattern where they create a script and set its content to 'dir'. This uniformity could be part of a larger script or tool's behavior, possibly attempting to establish persistence or perform some malicious task across the system.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that these events are all under 'Provider Lifecycle' in later entries suggests configuration changes or service-related activities. If an attacker is setting up persistent mechanisms, they might use such tasks to ensure their scripts run on startup or at regular intervals.\n\nConsidering the combination of creating multiple .bat files with specific content and the associated process creation and image loading events, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The repetitive pattern and the nature of the commands make it more than just normal script execution; it raises flags about possible scripting-based attacks aiming for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while individual events might not be alarming, the cumulative effect of these activities over multiple logs suggests a coordinated effort that could be malicious. However, without additional context like timestamps and exact file paths being accessed, some uncertainty remains. Nonetheless, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating and modifying .bat files across different directories with repetitive patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific .bat files. The paths in these commands seem to be varying but follow a similar structure. Each one uses `Test-Path` to see if a file exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This could indicate some form of script checking or validation, possibly part of legitimate operations or a way to check for certain conditions.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell creates and then deletes a temporary PS1 file. The creation and deletion within the same process might be normal if it's part of script execution, but it's worth noting because creating and then deleting files quickly can sometimes be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nI also see that PowerShell is accessing registry values and other processes, which isn't unusual on its own since PowerShell often interacts with system components. However, the combination with the file creation\/deletion could raise an eyebrow if these actions are out of the ordinary for the user or system.\n\nLooking at the files mentioned, some are related to Windows Defender (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll), which suggests that Defender is loading its components. That's normal during system startup or updates.\n\nThere's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management software, so nothing suspicious there unless it's doing something unexpected beyond its usual role.\n\nAnother point is the process named `winlogbeat.exe` creating a configuration file. This could be setting up logging for monitoring purposes, which is standard if that's how the system is configured.\n\nThe events involving `powershell.exe` accessing processes and registry values without any signs of malicious code execution (like writing to unexpected locations or communication over networks) don't show clear indicators of compromise.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while some actions like file creation\/deletion could be red flags, they might just be part of legitimate script executions or system checks. Without more context or additional suspicious activities across the logs, it's hard to conclude that there's malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for file existence and performing file operations in a pattern that may indicate script validation or potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

That's a common tool used to check user information, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process accessed. This is normal since many scripts and tools use PowerShell, but it's worth keeping an eye on how it's being used here.\n\nThen I see several events where PowerShell commands are checking if certain files exist in specific directories using Test-Path. Each command exits with 0 if the file exists or 1 if not. The paths look a bit odd—like \"C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\estrutura_secundario\\bin\\entrada_base.exe\"—could this be trying to check for specific files that shouldn't exist? Maybe part of some automated setup, but I'm concerned about the structure and naming.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple such events with different file paths. The repetition makes me think it's a script running multiple checks, possibly across different directories. This could indicate someone probing the system for certain files or trying to establish if specific components are present—maybe part of an attack chain.\n\nThe next set of logs shows registry value sets and process accesses related to PowerShell. That's a bit more concerning because modifying the registry can allow persistence or privilege escalation. If these are legitimate admin tasks, that's fine, but without context, it raises flags.\n\nThen there are image load events for various DLLs in the .NET framework when running PowerShell scripts. These are standard and usually not malicious on their own, so probably just part of how PowerShell operates.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple attempts to access specific files across different directories using PowerShell. The repeated checks might be an attempt to locate or verify certain binaries, possibly to execute them later. This could be a sign of fileless malware checking its components or part of a larger attack campaign trying to establish presence.\n\nI'm leaning towards INTERESTING because the combination of whoami.exe and multiple PowerShell commands accessing various files and registry entries seems unusual.

That's common because PowerShell is widely used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But I need to look at what it's doing.\n\nLooking through the events:\n- Some are about loading images (like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll), which are Windows Defender files. That seems normal.\n- There are file creations and deletions in temporary folders, like C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Creating temp files is standard for scripts, but deleting them might indicate trying to hide something.\n- Registry value sets could be part of legitimate configuration, but again, attackers sometimes use registry changes to persist.\n- Process accesses and pipe creations are normal inter-process communication, so nothing suspicious there initially.\n- There are whoami.exe and cmd.exe executions. Using these can be benign or for reconnaissance.\n\nI notice that some command lines in powershell.exe have complex paths checked with Test-Path. This could be a technique to check if certain files exist before proceeding, possibly as part of a payload delivery or to ensure the environment is correct for malicious activities.\n\nThe repetition of similar actions might indicate scripting or automated behavior, which isn't necessarily bad but could be part of an attack. The combination of checking file existence, creating\/ deleting temp files, and accessing registry suggests potential script execution that's trying to avoid detection or set up persistence.\n\nOverall, while many actions are benign, the specific sequence and multiple checks by powershell.exe raise some flags.

Each time, the command line arguments have complex file paths with conditional checks using Test-Path. For example, they're checking if certain .cs files exist in various directories. This seems unusual because such specific checks might indicate that an attacker is verifying whether specific files or structures are present on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell loads several DLLs, which can be normal for running scripts but might also be a sign of malicious activity trying to hide itself or load components.\n\nThe repeated use of conditional checks in the command line arguments stands out.

Let's start by looking at what each event shows.\n\nFirst, a lot of the events are from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly abused in attacks. The first few logs show ImageLoad and FileCreate actions. So powershell loaded some DLLs, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are related to Windows Defender components. That seems normal because they're part of the system's antivirus.\n\nThen there are events where files are created and deleted. For example, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then deleted. This could be part of a script testing phase or something malicious trying to clean up evidence. The naming of these scripts is a bit odd with \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" in them. I'm not sure if that's standard, but it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where the command line for powershell.exe checks whether certain .cs files exist using Test-Path. The paths they're checking vary, but they all seem to be looking for some file and exiting based on its presence. This could indicate that the script is trying to verify if a specific file exists before proceeding. If this is part of an installation or setup script, it's normal, but if not, it might be malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where the same command line checks different paths for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious because it implies keylogging, which is definitely a bad sign. If powershell.exe is executing this script and checking its presence, it could mean an ongoing attack trying to ensure the script runs without being detected.\n\nAnother point is the use of temporary files in different user directories. The paths are spread across various folders, which might be an attempt to avoid detection or to make analysis harder by scattering traces.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process creation event for whoami.exe. That tool is often used to check user permissions and can be part of legitimate troubleshooting but is also used by attackers to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances loading Defender-related DLLs, creating temporary scripts that get deleted, checking for specific files (possibly malicious), and attempting to run a keylogger script. The repetition of similar command lines with slight path variations suggests automated behavior, possibly part of an attack chain.

These are common tools, but unusual usage patterns or repeated executions might warrant closer look. For example, calc.exe is sometimes used to execute code via the calculator's keyboard features.\n\nRegistry value changes from svchost.exe caught my attention. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but unexpected registry modifications could indicate malicious activity, like installing backdoors or changing system configurations.\n\nThere are several network connections detected from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. While Chrome being active on the network isn't unusual, multiple connections without clear justification might suggest data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which could be signs of an attack.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe. Depending on its configuration, this could be normal logging behavior, but if it's creating unexpected files in certain directories, it might indicate tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nOverall, the combination of PowerShell activity, whoami executions, registry changes, and multiple network connections from different processes suggests potential malicious behavior. While each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious, together they create a concerning pattern that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and files, along with registry modifications and network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a common tool, but sometimes it's used maliciously because it has scripting capabilities. The command lines are checking if specific .ps1 files exist by using Test-Path. For example, the first event checks \"C:\\registro_base\\entrada_base\\objeto_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". If the file exists, it exits with 0; else, 1. This seems like a script is trying to verify if another script is present.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .NET and DLL files. That's normal since PowerShell uses these libraries, but sometimes attackers might load malicious modules or use reflective loading, though I don't see any obvious signs here.\n\nThen, two FileCreate events in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory creating a PSScriptPolicyTest file and immediately deleting it with a FileDeleteDetected event. This behavior is suspicious because creating and then deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection or persistence. It might be testing if certain scripts are allowed or checking for their presence without leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the process names, they're all powershell.exe except one winlogbeat.exe which seems unrelated. The fact that there are multiple attempts to check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths suggests that an attacker is trying to ensure that a malicious script exists on the system. Keystroke loggers are often part of malware, so this could indicate such an intent.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated checks for specific scripts, quick file creation and deletion, and multiple process activities around PowerShell—all these factors point towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't super high because sometimes admins run scripts or there might be legitimate checks, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple attempts to check for a specific PowerShell script's existence and subsequent file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are related to PowerShell activities. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and by attackers for lateral movement and persistence. So any unusual PowerShell activity could be a red flag.\n\nI notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines. For example, one event shows `powershell.exe` executing `{ls -recurse\\ngci -recurse}` which translates to using `ls` (Get-ChildItem) recursively and then again getting child items. This kind of command might be used to traverse directories looking for files or other items, but without context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a file in the Temporary folder: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1`. The fact that a script was created and then deleted might indicate an attempt to execute code without leaving a trace. Attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting files after execution, so this could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where PowerShell accesses the registry and loads images. Registry access is common in scripts for configuration or persistence, but again, multiple such events without legitimate justification might raise eyebrows.\n\nLooking at the frequency of these events: numerous ProcessCreate, ImageLoad, FileCreate, FileDeleteDetected tasks all within a short time frame. This clustering could suggest an automated script running malicious activities, possibly part of a larger campaign.\n\nConsidering the user context, if the user 'fiddelis' is legitimate and usually runs such scripts, it might not be suspicious. However, without knowing the user's normal behavior, any deviation from baseline activity should trigger investigation.\n\nThe combination of creating, deleting files, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions could collectively indicate malicious intent, especially since these actions don't seem to serve a clear benign purpose.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry access, and repeated process creations suggest potential malicious behavior. The script execution and cleanup patterns are concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with command lines that involve ls, get-childitem, and gci -recurse. These look like PowerShell commands that list directories recursively, which could be part of normal system administration or maybe something more nefarious like data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog events: I see \"Provider Lifecycle,\" \"Engine Lifecycle,\" \"Image loaded,\" \"File created,\" and \"Registry value set.\" These are pretty standard events when processes start, files are written, and registry changes occur. Not immediately suspicious on their own.\n\nThere's also a mention of MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That seems legitimate—Windows Defender is part of the system, so that process is probably normal.\n\nI notice that some file paths are pointing to locations like Downloads or AppData. For example, there's an estrutura_secundario.txt in the Downloads folder. This could be a log file, but without context, it's hard to say. It might just be a document someone downloaded or created.\n\nAnother point is that winlogbeat.exe is creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs, so this seems expected if the system has it installed and running. No red flags there unless there are signs of tampering or unauthorized access, which I don't see here.\n\nThere are a few registry value sets by powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of script execution, but again, not inherently malicious without more context.\n\nThe events involving conhost.exe are interesting because it's often used in command prompt operations. But since it's paired with a registry event, and there's no indication of misuse, I don't think it's suspicious.\n\nPutting all this together: the same user (fiddelis) is running multiple PowerShell commands, which could be legitimate if they're administering their system or running scripts. The events are spread across different tasks—loading images, file creation, registry changes—which align with normal process behavior. The presence of MpClient.dll and Winlogbeat further supports that these aren't unusual activities.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, malware indicators, or异常的文件路径. So while PowerShell is often used in attacks, the context here doesn't suggest malicious intent. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem relevant for a deeper investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as Windows Defender loading and file creations by winlogbeat.exe. PowerShell commands are present but appear to be part of legitimate activities or system administration tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
