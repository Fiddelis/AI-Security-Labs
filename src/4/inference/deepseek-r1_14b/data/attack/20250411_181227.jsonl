{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is something I should look into more deeply.\n\nLooking at the first six entries, they all involve powershell.exe with command lines that create scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask. The commands are trying to execute calc.exe on startup, which seems suspicious because calc.exe isn't typically used maliciously but could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nEach event has different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., which might indicate multiple attempts or different payloads. This repetition makes me think it's intentional, possibly to avoid detection or to deploy the payload in various ways.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. These actions often happen during malicious activities to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The Process Create event with a command line that creates another scheduled task adds to this suspicionâ€”it looks like the script is setting up multiple tasks, which might be part of an attack.\n\nThe later entries show powershell.exe loading various .NET libraries. While PowerShell uses these for scripting, the fact that they're being loaded in sequence could indicate the execution of a malicious script or payload. Malware often loads such modules to hide its activities or execute code.\n\nThere's also a chrome.exe event creating a pipe and setting registry values, but since it's a legitimate application, unless there's evidence linking it to malicious activity, I might not focus on that. But in this context, the majority of suspicious events are related to powershell.exe, which is commonly used for attacks.\n\nThe combination of multiple scheduled tasks being created with administrative privileges and the loading of .NET libraries points towards potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe on startup, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events related to PowerShell.exe. Specifically, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that look suspicious. For example, the command line includes creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe upon logon. This is concerning because using administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\Administrators) and setting tasks to run at logon can be a common tactic in persistence attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events involving temporary files created by PowerShell scripts. The paths like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1\" suggest that these might be test scripts or payloads being executed. The fact that the script is deleted after creation could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe. While Chrome is a common application, frequent writes to the registry without clear justification could be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern of system modifications.\n\nLastly, there are several \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no associated process or file. This stands out because it suggests remote execution without clear context, which can be indicative of command-and-control activities or unauthorized access.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of PowerShell activity, scheduled task creation with administrative privileges, temporary file operations, registry modifications, and remote command executions creates a concerning pattern that aligns with potential malicious behavior. These events don't seem to be part of normal user activity and could indicate an attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell.exe executing commands, including creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges; file creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts; registry modifications by Chrome.exe; and numerous remote command executions. These events collectively indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. I'm supposed to determine whether a batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. The logs are given in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Process 'WmiPrvSE.exe' loaded the file 'taskschd.dll'. WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and is usually legitimate. Loading taskschd.dll might be normal, but I'll keep this in mind.\n\n2. **Events 2-4**: These are all from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process that hosts other services, so these events alone aren't suspicious unless they're doing something unusual. The same goes for event 13 with conhost.exe; it's a known process used by PowerShell.\n\n3. **Event 5**: Again, svchost creates a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks'. This path is standard for task scheduler-related files, so this doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\n4. **Events 6-7**: These events mention executing remote commands without specifying the process name. Remote command execution can be legitimate but might also indicate malicious activity. I'll note that these could be potential red flags depending on context.\n\n5. **Event 8**: Powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this is worth monitoring.\n\n6. **Events 9-10**: Powershell sets registry values and exits. Registry modifications by scripts can be normal but might also indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\n7. **Event 11**: Chrome.exe interacts with known DLLs (amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll). These are related to anti-malware scanning and AMSI protection, so this is expected behavior for a browser.\n\n8. **Events 12-30**: There's a lot of registry activity from chrome.exe. Constant registry writes might be unusual but could also be part of normal operation, especially if Chrome is updating or modifying settings. However, excessive writes without clear reason can be suspicious.\n\n9. **Event 31**: Another file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which seems to be related to log management. If this process is legitimate, then no issue here.\n\n10. **Events 32-34**: Powershell and chrome create additional files in user directories. Again, depending on what's being created, this could be normal or malicious.\n\nNow, looking at the batch as a whole: there are several events that might stand out. The remote command executions (events 6-7) without a clear process name are concerning because they could indicate unauthorized access or command execution. Additionally, the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe is unusual and might suggest something malicious, such as persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings in an unexpected way.\n\nHowever, many events seem normal for legitimate processes like svchost, Chrome, PowerShell, and winlogbeat. But the combination of remote commands and excessive registry changes raises the suspicion that there's some malicious activity occurring.\n\nI'm moderately confident because while some events are suspicious, others are within normal operating ranges. Without more context on what's considered baseline behavior for these processes, it's hard to be certain, but the red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications and remote command executions, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
