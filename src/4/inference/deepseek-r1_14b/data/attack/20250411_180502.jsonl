{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal for a browser since it needs to connect to websites and resolve domains. Nothing unusual here; users browsing the web would trigger these events regularly.\n\nNext, I notice several powershell.exe processes with different tasks. The first event shows a Registry value being set, which could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used in scripting and can execute commands. However, legitimate scripts might also modify the registry for configuration purposes. Then there's a process creation event where PowerShell starts another process using Start-Process, pointing to a batch file located at \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". Batch files can execute commands, and the path structure seems a bit convoluted. This could be suspicious because attackers might use such paths to hide malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs when running PowerShell. These are standard as PowerShell loads necessary components when executing scripts or commands, so this alone doesn't raise an alarm.\n\nThere's a file creation and subsequent deletion of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\" in the Temp directory. This could indicate script testing or execution. While legitimate scripts might do this, it's worth noting because attackers sometimes use such files for short-term actions to avoid detection.\n\nMultiple events show Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks associated with PowerShell. These are part of normal operations when starting or stopping services, but again, context is needed to assess intent.\n\nLastly, there's an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry. This seems normal as it's a system process that might interact with Windows settings.\n\nPutting this together: The batch shows a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities involving PowerShell executing scripts via Start-Process commands. The file creation and deletion, coupled with the specific paths in the command lines, raise concerns about potential malicious activity. While not conclusive evidence, these behaviors could be indicative of an attack vector using legitimate tools for nefarious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts and interacting with system components, which may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from Calculator.exe and powershell.exe setting registry values. Powershell is often used maliciously, but on its own, it's hard to say without more context. Then, I notice multiple chrome.exe processes modifying the registry repeatedly. That might be normal if Chrome is updating settings, but too many such events could indicate suspicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are cmd.exe and conhost.exe instances creating files or accessing the registry. These are common tools for attackers to execute scripts. For example, cmd.exe with a command line path like \"C:\\estrutura_logico\\...\" suggests some script execution might be happening. Additionally, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating files in user directories, which could be part of malicious activities.\n\nThe presence of svchost.exe creating a file in the NetworkService profile is also noteworthy because svchost is commonly used by malware to hide processes. And finally, there's a file creation event for \"componente_principal.txt\" by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder, which might be dropping malicious files.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show multiple instances of legitimate tools (powershell, cmd, chrome) performing actions that don't clearly indicate恶意行为 but could be part of an attack chain. The combination of registry modifications, script execution via command-line arguments, and file creations in various locations raises suspicions. While each event might not be malicious on its own, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and other processes performing suspicious activities such as registry modifications, file creations, and loading DLLs. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me look at each event carefully.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" and the task is \"Registry value set.\" This seems normal because Chrome often modifies registry settings during updates or configuration changes. Since all these events are from the same process and involve standard tasks, I don't see any immediate red flags here.\n\nNext, there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management, so this activity is expected. It's setting up its configuration file, which is part of its normal operation.\n\nThen, there's a process named \"powershell.exe\" that created a file called \"elemento_base.txt.\" PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting, but it can also be a vector for attacks. The creation of this file might be suspicious because it's named in a way that's not immediately clear—could it be part of malicious activity? However, without additional context like where the script came from or what exactly it's doing, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nConsidering all events together: multiple Chrome registry writes (normal), Winlogbeat setup (expected), and a PowerShell file creation. The only potentially concerning point is the PowerShell activity, but on its own, it doesn't indicate malicious behavior without more context. So overall, while I'm slightly cautious about the PowerShell event, the batch as a whole doesn't raise enough red flags to warrant immediate investigation.\n\nI'd classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence because there's some uncertainty around the PowerShell activity but not enough to be certain of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal activities such as Chrome registry modifications and Winlogbeat configuration setup, along with a PowerShell file creation which isn't definitively suspicious without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
