This behavior is suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace, which are common tactics in malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's the creation of a PowerShell startup profile (StartupProfileData-NonInteractive). While legitimate scripts might use this, it could also be a way to persist malicious code across reboots, making it another red flag.\n\nConsidering all these events together, especially the file creation and deletion, suggests potential malicious activity. The multiple powershell.exe accesses and image loads could indicate script execution trying to remain undetected or conducting reconnaissance.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being used without any command line info. Powershell is a common tool but can be malicious. The task is 'Registry value set', which could indicate changes to system settings—something suspicious.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe event with 'Process accessed'. This might mean it's accessing other processes, possibly for lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run. That seems normal for user enumeration but could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nMore powershell.exe events follow: registry changes again and process access. This repetition is concerning—it suggests ongoing activity that might be malicious.\n\nThere's a Process Create event for powershell.exe with a command line that looks empty, which is odd. Empty command lines can indicate obfuscation or attempts to hide commands.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are several Image loaded tasks from different DLLs, which could be normal for Powershell execution but might also load malicious modules.\n\nA file creation event creates a .ps1 script in the Temp directory. Creating scripts temp files is common for testing policies but can be a red flag if it's executed right after.\n\nImmediately after creation, there's a File Delete logged event. Deleting the script quickly could mean trying to remove evidence of its execution, which is suspicious.\n\nA Pipe Created event follows, which Powershell uses for communication—could be part of command execution or lateral movement.\n\nMore Image loads and another File Create in the StartupProfileData directory. That location isn't typically used by normal scripts, so it's worth noting.\n\nFinally, more Registry value sets and Process accesses. The combination seems like an attack vector: using Powershell with hidden commands, creating and deleting temp files, accessing registry, possibly dropping malware.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple indicators point towards potential malicious activity—registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in unusual locations, empty command lines suggesting obfuscation, and repeated process accesses. This batch shows a pattern that's not typical for normal user activity. So, I classify this as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including registry modifications, file creation and deletion in unusual locations, and repeated process accesses suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being accessed, creating processes, loading images, and even creating files. This could be normal admin activity since PowerShell is commonly used for system tasks. But sometimes it can also be a sign of malicious behavior because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution or persistence.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks:\n1. There's a process access event for powershell.exe. That means someone or something is interacting with it.\n2. Then there are several Process Create events for both whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is usually benign, just to check user info, but seeing it alongside powershell might be a red flag if used in the wrong context.\n3. The events where PowerShell accesses registry values (Registry value set) could be part of legitimate configuration changes, but attackers also use registry modifications for persistence or privilege escalation.\n4. There are multiple ImageLoad events showing different DLLs being loaded by PowerShell. Legitimate scripts might load these, but sometimes malicious scripts inject their own modules.\n5. A file creation event for a .ps1 script in the Temp directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1). Creating temporary scripts can be part of testing policies or actual execution. If this script was then deleted, it might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n6. There's also a File Delete event for that same script. Deleting files they just created isn't necessarily bad, but in some cases, attackers clean up their tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, the user ran whoami.exe and several PowerShell commands. The file creation and deletion of a .ps1 script is concerning because it might suggest that a malicious script was executed and then removed to avoid detection. Additionally, multiple registry accesses could be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations.\n\nHowever, without more context, these actions alone aren't conclusive. It's possible the user was running legitimate PowerShell scripts for administrative tasks. But given the combination of creating, executing, and deleting a script along with registry modifications, there are enough red flags to consider this batch as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with process info, winlog details, and sometimes file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers for malicious activities. The fact that it appears several times in the logs could be significant.\n\nLooking closer, one of the PowerShell processes has a command line argument: \"& {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This script seems to check if a specific file exists. The path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\" looks a bit unusual, and the fact that it's checking for procdump.exe makes me think—procdump is a legitimate tool but often used by attackers to dump process memory. If this script is trying to see if procdump exists, maybe it's part of an attempt to later execute it.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion events. PowerShell created a temporary .ps1 file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1\". It was then immediately deleted after creation. This behavior is suspicious because creating and quickly deleting files can be indicators of malicious activity, possibly to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events for various DLLs when PowerShell runs. While this is normal for scripts that load libraries, the combination with other actions might raise concerns about what those images are doing.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' processes also stand out. They're typically used to get user information, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation in an attack. Having multiple instances running might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThere's also a file creation event by 'svchost.exe' for \"keyValueLKG.dat\". Svchost is another legitimate process, but sometimes attackers can abuse it. The specific filename doesn't ring any bells immediately, but without more context, it could be part of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances with potentially suspicious command lines, creation and deletion of a script file in Temp, use of whoami.exe, and image loading activities. These behaviors don't definitively prove malware, but they do align with common tactics used in cyberattacks—like using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, persistence mechanisms, or information gathering.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with potentially suspicious command lines, including checks for external tools and temporary file operations indicative of possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might raise some flags.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the events: \"cmd.exe \/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". That command turns off Windows Defender Firewall. Disabling the firewall is a common tactic by attackers to prevent detection after compromising a system. So that seems suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are several registry-related tasks from svchost.exe. Svchost is a legitimate process but can be used maliciously to hide activities. The repeated registry modifications could be an attempt to create persistence or modify security settings.\n\nThe whoami.exe commands might not be inherently bad, but when combined with other actions like disabling firewall and accessing powershell, it suggests someone might be trying to gather information about the system's user context, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple process creations of potentially malicious tools, attempts to disable security features, and registry manipulations. This combination is concerning because it resembles a kill chain where an attacker gains access, elevates privileges, and covers their tracks. Therefore, the batch should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially malicious activities including disabling firewall, registry modifications, and use of tools like powershell.exe and whoami.exe, indicative of possible attack behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. There are 25 entries, all identical. Each event shows that the process is svchost.exe and there's a registry event indicating an object was added or deleted.\n\nSvchost.exe is a common Windows process used by various services. It's not inherently malicious, but it can be abused by malware. The fact that it's triggering so many registry events in quick succession might be concerning because legitimate processes usually don't do this frequently.\n\nI remember that some malware creates multiple registry entries to hide itself or change system configurations. So, 25 events in a row from the same process could signal something malicious. However, sometimes scripts or automated tools can generate similar logs unintentionally, so I'm not entirely sure if it's an attack.\n\nThe justification is the high frequency of these events and the nature of svchost.exe being a common target for malware. My confidence level isn't 100% because there might be legitimate reasons for these events, but the pattern does raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry changes by svchost.exe could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from svchost.exe logging registry changes. That's common because svchost is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services. So, these could just be normal activities. But I need to consider the entire batch together.\n\nWait, towards the end, there are some events involving powershell.exe with command lines that look suspicious. The commands are trying to create a new PSDrive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks like it's attempting to access another system over the network, which might be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nSo, combining all the events: multiple registry changes from svchost could be setting up persistence or configuration for something. Then, the powershell commands are trying to connect to another machine, which is a red flag. If these are happening together, it might indicate some malicious activity like establishing a backdoor or moving within a network.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the registry changes alone are suspicious, but combined with the powershell attempts, it's more concerning. The fact that there are multiple such events in quick succession could suggest automation, which is often used by attackers.\n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting because it shows potential malicious behavior—registry modifications and network connection attempts via powershell. My confidence isn't 100% because svchost changes can be legitimate, but the combination with powershell makes me lean towards INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and PowerShell activity suggesting potential lateral movement or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The user has provided two JSONL events that I need to analyze as a whole batch. My task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually, both are from the same source, involving PowerShell executing a command. The command checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific directory and exits with 0 if it does, otherwise 1. This seems like a script checking for the presence of another file, which is common in various legitimate scenarios.\n\nHowever, considering both events together, they're identical. The repetition might indicate something suspicious, like multiple attempts to check for a file's existence, possibly as part of a larger script or malicious activity attempting to bypass detection. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious.\n\nI need to weigh the justification for classification. The events are somewhat unusual because they're repeated and involve checking for an executable that might be used in attacks. However, they could also be part of a legitimate process monitoring script.\n\nThe confidence level shouldn't be too high since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior—just some indicators that need further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell events checking for the existence of procdump.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity or file integrity checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, each one is in JSONL format with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The file field is always \"None\" here, so I'll focus on process and winlog.\n\nStarting with the first event, the command line is 'powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. That looks suspicious because it's using PowerShell to create a new drive mapping. The use of New-PSDrive suggests that an attacker might be trying to access a remote system, maybe to gain access or move laterally within the network.\n\nThen, most of the other events have command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}', which is just starting PowerShell without any arguments. This could be normal if someone is using the shell interactively, but in this case, there are so many instances. It might indicate some automated process or script execution, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, there's a mix of 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. The engine lifecycle events relate to PowerShell starting up or shutting down, while provider lifecycle refers to loading or unloading providers like filesystem. If these are happening frequently in quick succession, it might indicate that someone is trying different commands or scripts quickly.\n\nThere's also an event later on where the command line checks if 'procdump.exe' exists. This tool is often used for debugging but can also be used maliciously to dump processes and possibly extract information or inject code. The fact that they're checking its existence before doing something might mean they're ensuring it's available, which could be a red flag.\n\nConsidering the frequency of these events—there are multiple instances of similar commands, especially the ones related to drive mapping and file checks—it seems like someone is testing access points or trying to execute multiple steps in an attack chain. The repeated use of PowerShell without much else suggests potential script execution or command injection attempts.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events have full paths to powershell.exe, which might be a tactic to avoid certain antivirus or endpoint protections that look for powershell.exe in the system directory but not necessarily checking for it elsewhere. This could be an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities could indicate a possible attack where an adversary is attempting to gain access, move within the network, or execute malicious scripts. The combination of creating drive mappings, frequent shell executions, and checking for specific tools like procdump.exe raises concerns about potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands show suspicious activity, including creating a new drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$ and repeated checks for procdump.exe. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as lateral movement or data extraction.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
