Svchost is a common Windows process, often used by legitimate services, but sometimes malware can hide under it. However, in this case, the files being created are within known system directories like SoftwareDistribution and Temp, which seems normal for updates or temporary files.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe from Microsoft Defender. It's creating several files in a temporary directory with names that look like update patches (like AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe). This is typical behavior when the antivirus is updating its definitions, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nLooking at setup.exe entries, they're creating various .exe files under the EdgeCore folder. These seem related to Microsoft Edge updates or components, which is expected and not unusual.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values is also standard for legitimate Windows processes handling certain system tasks.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe being accessed could be concerning, but without seeing command-line arguments or specific actions, it's hard to say. However, considering the other events are benign, this might just be a routine operation.\n\nOverall, all these activities fit within normal system operations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some log event.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are coming from 'svchost.exe'. That's a common system process, often associated with services running under different profiles, so it's not inherently suspicious on its own. The tasks involved are mainly 'Registry value set' and 'File created'.\n\nThe Registry modifications could be normal for system processes, especially since svchost is known to host various system services that might need to tweak the registry. But when I see multiple instances of the same task in a row, it makes me think—could this be part of a legitimate process or something malicious trying to hide?\n\nLooking at the file events: There are files being created under different Windows directories like 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\Logs', 'SoftwareDistribution', and 'ServiceProfiles'. These seem to be standard locations for system logs and update processes. For example, 'WindowsUpdate' and 'DeliveryOptimization' are legitimate services that create log files and cache data.\n\nHowever, the specific file paths do raise some flags. The path 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\Logs\\\\waasmedic\\\\...' looks a bit unusual, but I'm not sure if that's related to a known service or something else. Similarly, the 'edbtmp.log' in the SoftwareDistribution logs might be part of Windows Update or similar services.\n\nThe fact that many events are from 'svchost.exe' and involve registry writes could indicate potential malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes typical of malware. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nOn the other hand, these activities could also be part of legitimate Windows operations, especially since svchost is a common process. The repeated Registry sets might just be part of some service initializing or updating its configuration.\n\nI'm leaning towards it being not interesting because each individual action seems like something Windows would do normally. But I'm not entirely certain. There's a possibility that the combination could indicate something malicious, but without more data points—like timestamps, user context, or additional event types—it's hard to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal system processes involving registry modifications and file creations under standard directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. I see several entries from svchost.exe, which is a common system process that can sometimes be used by malware because it's part of Windows services. There are also RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, sppsvc.exe, and powershell.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: there are several \"Registry value set\" events and \"File created\" events. Registry modifications can indicate configuration changes, which could be normal or malicious. The file creation events point to new files being written somewhere on the system. \n\nThe paths mentioned in the file logs seem a bit concerning. For example, one path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache\\cache.dat. The spp directory relates to Windows activation and updates, so maybe that's part of legitimate operations. However, another path under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local... seems user-specific. Also, the multiple file creations under SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\ with various .dll files might be suspicious because those are system directories and creating many DLLs there could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe in combination with registry modifications is a red flag. Attackers often use Powershell for lateral movement or to execute scripts that can download additional tools. The fact that svchost.exe is involved in multiple events, including image loads and file creations, adds more concern because it's known to be used by various malware families.\n\nI also notice that several entries are about loading urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate Windows components, but their repeated use by different processes could indicate something amiss, like a script or process trying to load them multiple times for some malicious purpose.\n\nOverall, the combination of registry modifications, file creations in sensitive directories, and the use of powershell.exe along with svchost.exe activity makes me think this batch might be indicative of malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But considering all these points together, I'm leaning towards classifying it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications and file creations in sensitive directories by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: Process access for powershell.exe. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for attacks.\n\nSecond event: whoami.exe being executed. Not too concerning on its own, but it might be part of some reconnaissance to check user permissions.\n\nThird and fourth events again involve powershell.exe accessing processes and registry changes. Repeated use of PowerShell could indicate something malicious, especially when combined with registry modifications.\n\nFifth event is a Process Create for powershell.exe with a command line that includes importing a module from a specific path and executing some script. The script path has backslashes and looks like it's part of a longer file path. This is definitely red flag territory because scripts executed via PowerShell can be malicious, especially if they're downloading or modifying system settings.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs when running powershell.exe. These could be normal as PowerShell loads different components, but the combination with other actions might raise concerns.\n\nThen there's a File Create event of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory by fiddelis. Creating a new script file is suspicious. Following that, the same file is deleted, which is another red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid detection.\n\nA Pipe Created event for powershell.exe is noted. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but again, in the context of other malicious actions, it's concerning.\n\nMultiple Image Load events continue, and then svchost.exe creates a log file in SoftwareDistribution, which might be part of Windows Update or servicing stack operations. However, svchost.exe also does a registry value set, which could indicate something if done unexpectedly.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with command-line arguments that execute external scripts, especially one that's written to the Temp directory and then deleted. These actions are common in attack patterns—using PowerShell for execution, creating temporary files for payload storage or persistence, and cleaning up traces.\n\nI'm confident enough to say this batch is interesting because it shows signs of potential malicious activity, like script execution, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and use of tools often associated with attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing scripts, including a suspicious script created and deleted in the Temp directory, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event.\n\nFirst up is the whoami.exe process being created. That seems normal for user identification, nothing malicious on its own. Next, there are several entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting attacks. \n\nOne of the powershell events stands out: it's creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path. That name doesn't ring any bells, but the fact that it's setting up a service and starting it could indicate something malicious. Services can be long-lived and hard to detect, so this might be a persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is loading multiple DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET libraries, but one path points to MpOAV.dll, which I recognize as part of Windows Defender. That's concerning because sometimes attackers replace legitimate modules with malicious ones or use known processes for hiding.\n\nThen there's a file being created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The naming pattern \"__PSScriptPolicyTest...\" looks suspicious—maybe it's testing script execution policies. Quick creation and deletion could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, services.exe is setting multiple registry values. Services.exe is legitimate, but frequent registry changes might indicate configuration of a service or persistence mechanisms. Since this happens five times in a row, it could be part of deploying malicious software that registers itself in the system.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell creating a service, using process injection techniques, and manipulating files and registry—these are common tactics in malware. The repeated actions by services.exe and the suspicious file operations add to the concern. I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING with high confidence because multiple red flags suggest potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including powershell.exe creating a service, accessing registry values, loading unexpected modules, and deleting temporary files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Most of them are the same: repeated attempts to execute a remote command on a specific PowerShell script path. That's a red flag because such activity is often associated with malicious behavior like scripting attacks or unauthorized access. The fact that it's happening so many times in a row suggests potential automation or persistence mechanisms, which are common in cyberattacks.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of events where the process is 'services.exe' and the task is 'Logon'. This might indicate legitimate system activity, but given the volume of other suspicious events, it adds context without necessarily being benign on its own. The mix of different logon types (like 'Special Logon') could be another layer to consider, possibly related to service accounts or remote access.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent execution attempts on the same file path across multiple events are concerning. This pattern isn't typical of normal user behavior and could signal an attack in progress, such as ransomware or a persistent threat. Therefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple repeated attempts to execute a remote command on the same file path, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell commands. The command lines are importing a module and then invoking some functions. There's also an attempt-catch block which might be used for error handling or obfuscation. This could be a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to hide their tracks or make their code more resilient.\n\nThen, I notice multiple events where the task is \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These are related to service creation and management. The command line here is creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" using New-Service and starting it. This seems suspicious because creating services can be a way for malware to persist on a system.\n\nFurther down, there's a series of events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". These events don't have a process command line but reference a file path pointing to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script is being executed remotely, which could indicate that an attacker is using it to carry out malicious activities on the system.\n\nPutting this together, there's a pattern of PowerShell commands creating services and executing remote scripts. The repetition of similar commands suggests a possible automated or scripted attack. Additionally, the use of service creation can lead to persistence across reboots, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nI'm concerned that these activities might be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The combination of remote script execution and service creation points towards potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation to determine if it's indeed a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity involving service creation and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, there are multiple entries from \"tarefa_logico.exe\" loading various .NET files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. This seems normal because these DLLs are part of the .NET framework and should be loaded by applications that use it. No red flags here.\n\nThen I notice a few events involving powershell.exe. The first one is about creating a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's standard if scripts are being run on startup, but sometimes suspicious scripts can also create files there. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's an event where \"powershell.exe\" sets a registry value. This could be legitimate for configuration purposes, but it might also be used by malware to persistence. I'll have to see what the exact task is and if it's commonly associated with malicious activities.\n\nThere are several events marked as \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This catches my attention because executing remote commands can be a sign of command-line attacks or remote execution vulnerabilities being exploited. It could indicate something like remote code injection, which is often malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where the process command line runs powershell.exe with specific arguments importing a PowerShell script from \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The same command appears several times, which might suggest repeated attempts or a loop. This repetition could be part of a larger script trying to execute malicious code multiple times, possibly to ensure it runs despite interruptions.\n\nThe script being imported is named \"componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" Without seeing the actual script content, it's hard to say if it's malicious, but the context suggests it's doing something non-standard given the file path and how it's being executed. Also, the command line includes a try-catch block with Start-Sleep 5, which could be an attempt to wait for some condition or to slow down detection mechanisms.\n\nThe justification for classification would focus on the repeated execution of powershell.exe with imported scripts from an unusual path and the remote command executions. These activities are more likely than not indicative of malicious behavior, so my confidence is high that this batch should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated execution of powershell.exe with imported scripts from an unusual path and remote command executions, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

This script execution might be legitimate or could indicate malicious activity like remote code execution.\n\nHowever, looking closer, many of these events have identical file paths and tasks. The repetition suggests it's part of a normal process, maybe an automated task running multiple times. But the presence of PowerShell scripts can be a red flag since they're often used in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of entries where the task is \"None\" or related to Windows Update Agent, which doesn't raise alarms on its own. The last few events revert back to the remote command execution with the same script path.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the repeated remote commands could be suspicious, without more context like timestamps or additional logs indicating unusual behavior, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.
