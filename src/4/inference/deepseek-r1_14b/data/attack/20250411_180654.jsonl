{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe creates a file called objeto_temporario.txt. That's suspicious because PowerShell is often used in attacks. Creating a temporary file might be part of malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, repeated writes could indicate something fishy, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen, whoami.exe runs without any arguments. That's odd because it usually outputs user info, and running it without parameters might be a test to see if the system is vulnerable or part of a larger script.\n\nLooking further, there are several powershell.exe processes with command lines that execute scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests keylogging, which is definitely malicious. The fact that they're writing logs to temp files adds to the concern.\n\nAlso, in some events, powershell.exe accesses other processes and loads various DLLs. This could be part of loading malicious modules or trying to hide its activity.\n\nLastly, two more events with powershell.exe running similar scripts under different paths. This repetition indicates a pattern, possibly a script being executed multiple times or from different locations, which is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of PowerShell executing keylogging scripts, repeated registry changes by Chrome, and other indicators like process creation without clear purpose suggest malicious behavior. So the batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), which suggests keylogging or other malicious activities, along with repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe that may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that several events involve powershell.exe being executed with command lines pointing to different paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it might be related to capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to steal user input such as passwords. The fact that the LogPath is set to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log indicates that the script is writing logs there, possibly for later exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes, they include Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and others related to file operations like creation and deletion. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific scripts raises red flags because legitimate use would usually not involve multiple instances of such scripts unless there's automation or something suspicious happening.\n\nThere are also events where files are created in temporary directories, which is a common technique for malware to avoid detection by using transient storage. For example, the file paths under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp suggest that these are temporary files created during script execution, possibly to hide malicious activities or to clean up after themselves.\n\nAnother point of interest is the event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost.exe is often used by attackers to execute commands without being detected as easily as powershell.exe might be. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to survive system reboots.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple file creation events in different locations, including one under C:\\Windows\\System32 for urlmon.dll, which I'm not immediately sure about but could be related to loading malicious libraries or bypassing security measures.\n\nI also see an event where a remote command is executed. This could indicate that the system is communicating with a remote server, possibly exfiltrating data or receiving further instructions, which is a hallmark of command-and-control (C2) activity in malware.\n\nWhile there are some legitimate events like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and svchost.exe writing to delivery optimization state files, these don't outweigh the suspicious activities involving powershell.exe and multiple script executions related to keystroke logging.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of repeated powershell.exe invocations with potentially malicious scripts, temporary file creations, registry modifications, and a remote command execution strongly suggests that this batch of logs is indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, it's relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different paths, combined with temporary file operations and registry modifications, suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, meaning each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. There are three events here. Each has \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\" fields.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process name: svchost.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat\n\nSvchost.exe is a common Windows process that can be legitimate or malicious because it's often used by malware to hide their activities. The file created here is in the Delivery Optimization State folder, which I know is related to Windows Update. However, sometimes attackers might create files in system directories for persistence or other purposes.\n\nSecond event:\n- Process name: winlogbeat.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n\nWinlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting Windows logs, often part of the Elastic Stack. The file being created here seems to be a configuration file for winlogbeat itself, ending with .new. This might just be during an update or installation.\n\nThird event:\n- Process name: powershell.exe\n- Task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt\n\nPowershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The file created here is just a text file in the user's Downloads folder, which doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nNow, considering all three events together. Svchost.exe creating a file in a system directory might be suspicious because it's commonly associated with malware. However, sometimes Windows services also use svchost for legitimate tasks. The winlogbeat event is likely normal as it's part of log management. The powershell event alone isn't concerning unless it's doing something malicious.\n\nBut looking at the files created:\n1. keyValueLKG.dat in a system directory by svchost.exe might be suspicious.\n2. .winlogbeat.yml.new seems benign.\n3. entrada_padrao.txt by powershell is neutral without more context.\n\nHowever, without additional context about these events (like timestamps showing if they happened around the same time or other related activities), it's hard to say definitively. The presence of svchost.exe creating a file could indicate potential malicious activity, but it might also be a legitimate system process.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of processes (svchost.exe and powershell.exe) can sometimes be indicators of compromise, even if each event alone isn't suspicious enough. The confidence is moderate because while there are red flags, they could also be normal activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The combination of processes (svchost.exe and powershell.exe) creating files in specific paths may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
