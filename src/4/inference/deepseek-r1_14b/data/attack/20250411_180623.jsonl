{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few lines involve 'chrome.exe' doing a DNS query. That's normal because Chrome needs to resolve domain names when browsing the web. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from 'powershell.exe'. The first one shows that PowerShell was created and ran a command: {Get-Date}. That's just getting the current date, which is standard for script execution. But I notice it appears several times with different tasks like Registry value sets and Image loads. This makes me think someone might be running multiple PowerShell commands or scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell creates files in temporary directories, specifically a .ps1 file. Then, the same file is deleted shortly after. Creating and deleting temp files could be part of script execution, but it's also a common tactic for malicious actors to clean up evidence. This might warrant closer look.\n\nAnother thing I see is multiple ImageLoad events from different DLLs when PowerShell runs. This can be normal for scripts that use .NET frameworks, but the number of specific DLLs loaded might indicate something more complex or potentially malicious activity.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events in PowerShell, which could be used for inter-process communication. While legitimate, it's a technique sometimes abused by malware to hide command and control channels.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' is involved in several file operations, especially creating and deleting files. The fact that they're using PowerShell extensively might raise flags if the user isn't known for such activity on their system.\n\nAdditionally, there are some entries from 'winlogbeat.exe', which I believe is part of the Elastic Stack for log management. Its FileCreate event doesn't seem concerning unless it's related to other suspicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell instances executing commands, creating and deleting files in temp directories, loading various DLLs, and creating pipes. These behaviors could indicate script execution or, more worryingly, components of a malicious payload being deployed. The repetitive nature and specific file operations make the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing commands, creating\/deleting temp files, loading several DLLs, and pipe creations suggest potential script execution or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe setting a registry value via the RegistryEvent rule. PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, so this could be suspicious. But sometimes it's also legitimate.\n\nSecond event: Again, powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. Combined with the first, this might indicate some activity, but not conclusive yet.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. This is normal since it's an agent that logs events and might update its config files. Doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting them together, the two PowerShell events could be part of legitimate admin tasks or malicious activity. Without more context like timestamps or other events, it's hard to tell. The winlogbeat event is benign. So, I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because there's not enough evidence to suggest malicious behavior, but I have some uncertainty.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal activities: PowerShell executing tasks and Winlogbeat creating configuration files. No signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
