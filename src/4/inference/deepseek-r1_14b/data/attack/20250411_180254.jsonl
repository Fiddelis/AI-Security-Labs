{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what they indicate.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and systeminfo.exe are being executed with commands that access the registry or system information. For example, cmd.exe running \"systeminfo\" and then querying the Registry for disk services. This seems normal for a user performing system checks, but repeated such actions could be suspicious.\n\nI notice several entries where svchost.exe is modifying registry values and creating files in log directories. Svchost is commonly associated with legitimate Windows services, but it's also known to be used by malware. The creation of event logs might indicate an attempt to alter system behavior or hide malicious activities.\n\nThere are also events involving WmiPrvSE.exe, which is related to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). This process is often targeted by attackers for privilege escalation or persistence. The command line parameters here don't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other activity, it's something to watch.\n\nMultiple entries show the use of various system utilities like reg.exe and systeminfo.exe being executed through cmd.exe and powershell.exe. While these are standard tools, their repeated use, especially in combination with registry modifications, could be a sign of malicious behavior, such as installing backdoors or altering system configurations.\n\nThe logbeat process creating a configuration file seems benign, but the fact that it's writing to a .yml.new file might indicate an update or new configuration deployment. Without more context, this isn't obviously suspicious, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger activity chain.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the batch shows a series of process creations and system accesses, particularly through powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe. These activities include querying and modifying registry values, creating files, and loading various DLLs. While individually these actions might not be concerning, their frequency and combination could suggest potential malicious activity such as system reconnaissance, persistence mechanisms, or privilege escalation.\n\nI should also consider the lack of any file paths indicating known malware or specific indicators. However, the repeated use of tools often used in attacks (like powershell.exe for command execution) is a red flag. Additionally, processes like WmiPrvSE and svchost.exe are known to be exploited by attackers, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nGiven all these points, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while each event might not be malicious on its own, together they show signs of potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of system process creations and access attempts, including powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe performing registry modifications. These activities may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior such as system reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the first event is Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because system tools often interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nNext, multiple chrome.exe processes are setting registry values and loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, so no red flags there.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory, which is expected as it's an agent logging tool. No issues here.\n\nPowershell.exe creates a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both benign and malicious activities, but the filename doesn't immediately raise concerns. However, I should consider if this activity is part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the frequency, chrome.exe has multiple RegistryEvent tasks. While some registry access is normal, too many could indicate something suspicious like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together, there are no clear signs of malicious activity. Most events are standard operations from common applications and system processes. The winlogbeat and powershell activities don't show any overtly malicious traits based on the given data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system activities such as registry value modifications by Chrome.exe, loading legitimate system files, and creation of configuration files. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
