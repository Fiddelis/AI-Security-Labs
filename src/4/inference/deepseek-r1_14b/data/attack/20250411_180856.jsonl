{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's normal because Chrome is a browser that connects to the internet and does DNS lookups all the time. Nothing suspicious here; just regular activity.\n\nNext, I see an event where powershell.exe set a registry value. PowerShell can do a lot, so this could be concerning, but it depends on what command was run. The event doesn't show the command line, so I'm not sure if it's malicious or just legitimate admin work.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process that ran \"wmic process call create notepad.exe\". Using wmic to create processes is a classic technique used in some malware and exploit kits because it can bypass certain detection mechanisms. This stands out as potentially suspicious because creating processes via WMI might indicate an attempt to hide or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances of WMIC.exe loading various DLLs. While some are legitimate like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, others like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could be part of normal operations. But the fact that there are multiple ImageLoad events might raise an eyebrow—maybe it's related to the malicious process creation.\n\nThere's also an event where notepad.exe was created via cmd.exe. Notepad is a common tool, but if it was created by another process like wmic, it could be part of a chain leading to something more malicious. However, without seeing additional events after that, it's hard to say.\n\nOther events include various processes accessing the registry and creating files, which could be normal or part of setup\/installation processes. The winlogbeat.exe creating files seems related to log management software, so that's probably benign.\n\nLastly, there are some system processes like services.exe and svchost.exe doing standard operations, which are expected.\n\nPutting it all together: the wmic process creation is a red flag because it's often used in attacks. Even though other events might be normal, this one activity could indicate an exploit or malicious behavior. I'm not 100% certain because sometimes admins use similar commands, but given the combination of WMI usage and creating processes, it leans towards suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of process creation via WMI (wmic.exe) and powershell.exe registry modifications, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not. First, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notepad isn't typically malicious, so that's probably normal.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell can be used for good or bad things, but just access might not be enough—needs more context.\n\nThen, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, I know that some malware uses legitimate processes like calc.exe and loads DLLs to hide their activities. Urlmon is a system DLL, so it's legitimate, but this might still be suspicious.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe multiple times setting registry values. SvcHost is commonly used by services, but if it's doing registry writes frequently, that could indicate something malicious, especially since it appears several times.\n\nAnother svchost event, same as before—so multiple instances of the same process doing similar actions might be a pattern worth noting.\n\nCalculator.exe again loading urlmon.dll. Similar to calc.exe earlier; could this be part of an infection routine?\n\nAnother powershell access, then whoami.exe being executed with command line. Whoami is typically used to get user info. If it's run without any suspicious flags, maybe not too bad. But if combined with other events...\n\nThen more powershell accesses and another svchost registry write. The repetition of these processes doing similar tasks raises an eyebrow.\n\nThere's a services.exe logon event, which is normal for services starting up.\n\nLastly, a special logon without a process—could be related to system startup or network authentication, not sure.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry could indicate something like persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll might be part of an infection vector where malicious code injects into legitimate processes. Also, the several powershell accesses and whoami execution could be reconnaissance or part of a payload delivery.\n\nSo overall, these events seem to show signs that might indicate malicious activity, but I'm not 100% certain without more context. The confidence is high enough to mark it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying registry values and the use of legitimate processes like calc.exe loading system DLLs, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence or code injection.
