The path structure seems normal, but there are a lot of similar files being created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by different hashes in the filenames. This suggests that these could be cached resources or temporary files generated by an application. Since each event is a file creation, it's possible this is part of normal operation when an app downloads or updates its resources.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here. The process name doesn't ring any bells as something suspicious, and the file paths are within standard user directories.

I notice that all the events have similar structures but with slight variations in file paths.\n\nFirst off, every event has \"process\": {\"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\"}, which tells me the same process is creating files. The \"winlog\" field indicates that each event is related to a file creation task. That's straightforward enough—it seems like SDXHelper.exe is responsible for these file operations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\... and the filenames are variations of \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" with different hashes or identifiers. These files are stored in an \"OfflineFiles\" directory within a specific package resource.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this activity is normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—it might be part of Microsoft Office's setup or update process. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder suggests these could be resources needed for Excel's Copilot feature, which relies on JavaScript strings.\n\nNow, why are there so many events? Each event is a file creation, and they all come from the same process. It could just be how Office packages its resources during installation or updates. The repeated pattern in filenames makes me think these files might be different versions or parts of the same resource being placed in the offline cache.\n\nI should consider if multiple file creations by the same process are unusual. In cybersecurity, repetitive and bulk operations can sometimes indicate malicious activity, but in this case, it seems legitimate—Office installing its components. The paths lead to a standard AppData directory, which is typical for application resources.\n\nNo signs of anomalies here, like unexpected locations or processes accessing restricted areas. All the files are within expected user directories. If there were attempts to write to system folders or create hidden files, that would raise flags, but that's not happening here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating multiple JavaScript files in a standard location related to Microsoft Office features.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got 14 JSONL entries here, each describing an event where a file was created by the process SDXHelper.exe. All these files are located in the same directory under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\", and they have similar names but different hashes at the end.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I recall, it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the update or solution packages. These are legitimate processes that manage updates and additional features in Office applications.\n\nEach event shows a file creation task. The files all seem to be JavaScript (.js) files, which are common in Office add-ins or components. The paths are within \"AppData\\\\Local\", which is typical for user-specific data and settings.\n\nThe repeated nature of the events—same process creating multiple files with similar names but different hashes—makes me think this might be part of a normal update cycle. Maybe these are temporary files being created as part of an Office package update, like Copilot features or other add-ins. Since each file is named similarly but has a unique hash, it suggests they're different versions or parts of the same component.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is known and common, and the file operations are typical for updates. No unusual paths, access to sensitive areas, or other red flags that might indicate an attack.\n\nOn the other hand, if these files were being created in a restricted area without proper permissions or if the hashes didn't match known good ones, that would be more concerning. But as it stands, everything points to legitimate Office-related activity.\n\nSo, considering all events together, they don't raise any red flags. The repeated file creations by a known process are likely part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe, which is related to Microsoft Office updates or solution packages.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that the user provided. Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, let's break down what each event looks like. Every line has a \"process\" field with the name \"SDXHelper.exe\", which suggests it's an executable file running on the system. Then there's a \"winlog\" field indicating that a file was created, specifically noting that the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The \"file\" field gives the path where the file was created.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I notice that they're all from the same process and each event creates a new file. The paths are similar but have different filenames. For example, one file is named \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_bc27bc578cb830e5653d09d0c94a6030.js\", another is \"_c3a1e3c4beadd5c7adc87ffe9417c8cf.js\", and so on. These seem to be JavaScript files with long hashes in their names.\n\nNow, considering the classification options: \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to evaluate whether this batch of events should be looked into further.\n\nThe process name is SDXHelper.exe. From what I know, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which are used for add-ins and customizations. These packages often include files like JavaScript or other resources that get downloaded or extracted when the office application runs. So, it makes sense that this process is creating these files in the OfflineFiles directory under the SolutionPackages path.\n\nLooking at the timestamps of each event would help determine if these creations are happening rapidly. If they're all within a short period, it might indicate something suspicious, like a script generating multiple files quickly. But without the timestamp data, I can't be sure about that.\n\nThe file paths seem legitimate for an Office environment. The structure under AppData and Microsoft's Office directory aligns with standard locations where such files would be stored. Also, the naming pattern of the files looks consistent with how resources might be organized—using hashes to version or differentiate between different strings used by the Copilot feature.\n\nI also consider if there are any red flags. The creation of multiple JavaScript files could be a sign of malicious activity, especially in large volumes. However, in this case, they're coming from an Office-related process that's known to generate such resources. Unless the hashes indicate something suspicious or these files contain malware, which isn't evident here, it seems more like normal operation.\n\nAnother angle is whether the number of events is unusual. There are 14 events here, each creating a different file. While this might seem high, in an environment where multiple add-ins or customizations are being loaded, it's possible for many files to be created as part of the setup process.\n\nI should also think about alternative explanations. Could this activity be indicative of a script or tool generating temporary files? Maybe, but without additional context like user behavior or other logs showing unusual patterns, it's hard to say. But given that the process is tied to Microsoft Office and the file structure matches known conventions, it leans towards legitimate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the batch consists of multiple file creation events by a known Office-related process in a standard directory structure with expected filenames. While large numbers could sometimes be concerning, here they seem to fit normal operations related to Office add-ins or customizations. Without evidence of malicious intent or other anomalies, I'd classify this as not interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process under a Microsoft Office directory, which is consistent with normal operation of Office add-ins or customizations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to be an event from the system logs.\n\nFirst off, each event has three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across every entry, so it looks like this is a single process generating multiple log entries.\n\nThe task under winlog for each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, every time there's an entry here, the system is logging that a file was created. The files are located in a specific path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\\OfflineFiles\\. That seems like a standard location for Office-related resources or temporary files.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all start with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_\" followed by different hashes. These are likely JavaScript files used by Excel Copilot, which is a feature in Microsoft Office that provides AI assistance. The varying file names suggest that each is a different version or resource file being downloaded or created.\n\nNow, considering the nature of these events: multiple file creation events from the same process in the same directory for what appear to be legitimate resources. Since SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office and Copilot, it's part of the normal operation of the software. The fact that there are 14 such entries might seem a bit high, but it could just mean that multiple files are being handled during a session or update.\n\nI should also think about whether this kind of activity is typical. In a normal scenario, applications do create temporary or resource files when they run. Office apps, especially with features like Copilot, might need to load several resources, leading to multiple file creation events. So, seeing these entries isn't unusual on its own.\n\nIs there anything that stands out as suspicious? The process name is legitimate, the task is a standard file operation, and the files are in an expected location. There's no indication of any anomalies like unexpected paths, access patterns, or deviations from baseline behavior. No signs of failed operations or attempts to write to restricted areas.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers might create multiple files as part of their activities, but here the naming convention is predictable and matches known Microsoft resources. Also, all events are file creations without any deletions or modifications immediately following, which would be more concerning if present.\n\nI should also consider if there's a volume issue. 14 entries might not be that many in a system with high activity, especially over a period of time. If these were all happening within a very short window, it could raise an eyebrow, but without a timestamp context, I can't say for sure. However, given the consistent structure and content, it's likely benign.\n\nIn conclusion, these events don't exhibit any signs of malicious behavior. They seem to be part of the normal operation of Microsoft Office components. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other suspicious activities. Therefore, this batch doesn't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process, which appears to be part of Microsoft Office's normal operation for handling resources associated with Excel Copilot.

That makes me think it's a legitimate application activity because some processes write multiple files regularly. The file paths all point to a specific location within the user's AppData directory, specifically under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. This seems like a standard place for Office-related data or plugins.\n\nEach file path is unique but has a similar naming convention: \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by various hex strings and .js extension. These could be JavaScript files used by the Excel Copilot feature. The fact that they're being created multiple times suggests it's part of the normal operation, perhaps during updates or initial setup.\n\nI check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office, specifically handling updates and data synchronization. This aligns with creating files in the OfflineFiles directory, which likely stores cached data for offline use.\n\nThe repetition of file creation events could be normal if the system is updating or syncing multiple resources. However, I should consider whether creating many files quickly might indicate something suspicious, like a potential exploit or malicious script generating files rapidly. But given that all events come from the same process and target a known directory, it seems less likely.\n\nAnother angle: Are these file paths normal? They seem to be part of the Office setup, so probably not malicious. The exact duplication in some of the file names might suggest redundant writes or failed attempts, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI also think about whether this could be related to known attacks.

Specifically, it's creating multiple .js files with various hashes in their names.\n\nLooking at these events, I see that each one is a file creation by SDXHelper.exe. This process might be legitimate since Microsoft Office often uses such helpers for features like Copilot. The repetition of similar events makes me think this could be part of a normal update or cache activity. However, the consistent pattern and multiple identical files created make me cautious.\n\nThere are also two events from \"MdSched.exe,\" which is known to handle Windows Update-related tasks, so those seem normal too. Additionally, there's an event from \"consent.exe\" loading some DLLs, which again appears standard as these processes often interact with system components.\n\nSince all the file creations are within expected Office package areas and match known legitimate activities (like Copilot string files), there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here.

Each event is a JSON object indicating that \"SDXHelper.exe\" created a file in specific locations. The files are JavaScript resources related to Excel Copilot and some vendor code.\n\nFirst, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office's setup or update processes. It's responsible for managing offline content, like templates and add-ins. So, it's normal for this process to create these types of files during updates or installations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be within the standard user profile directory under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\".

Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nAll the events have a similar structure: the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which seems like it's from Microsoft Office since I've heard that before. The task in each case is \"File created\" according to the winlog, and the file paths all point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they have names like \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" and \"vendors~...\", which suggests these are JavaScript files related to Excel features or third-party vendor resources. The repetitive naming pattern with different hashes (like 68fa3d8d421a1018...) indicates multiple versions or instances of the same resource being downloaded or cached.\n\nI also notice that some events repeat, like the creation of \"vendors~researchworkspace.js\" and others happening twice each. This duplication makes me think it's part of a normal update process where multiple files are being created during an Office package update or cache refresh. The paths inside SolutionPackages support this idea since that's where Microsoft stores such add-ins and resources.\n\nSince all events come from the same process and involve standard file creation tasks in known directories, there's no sign of any unusual behavior. No elevated privileges are mentioned, nor are these files located in unexpected areas like system folders or user-specific hidden directories beyond AppData.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here, such as writes to restricted locations, use of uncommon tools, or irregular file hashes.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user has given me a series of JSONL logs where each line represents an event. The first thing I notice is that all these events are from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a good starting point because knowing which process is involved can give context about what might be happening.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they all have the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and the file paths seem to be under different package resources within the Office application. The files are named things like \"vendors~file-link-plugin.js\" and variations of \"excel-copilot-strings\". These names suggest that these might be JavaScript files related to some add-ins or plugins for Excel, possibly part of Microsoft's Office Suite.\n\nThe repetition is striking. Each event seems to create a new file under either the 8988909c... package or the 82bbdf66... package. Some files are created multiple times, like \"vendors~file-link-plugin.js\" appears twice, and others like \"vendors~lazyloadeddesigner_...\" also repeat. This duplication makes me think: why is the same file being created more than once? Is this part of a normal process or could it indicate something malicious?\n\nI know that legitimate software updates sometimes involve creating new files, especially if they're adding resources for features like Copilot in Excel. The presence of \"excel-copilot-strings\" in the filenames supports this idea because I'm familiar with how Copilot works as an AI assistant within Excel. These strings might be part of the natural language processing components required by Copilot.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if SDXHelper.exe is a known process. From what I recall, it's related to Microsoft Office, possibly handling updates or package resources. If that's the case, then creating these files would be standard behavior during an update or when enabling new features. The fact that all events are under this process and involve file creation for known plugin structures makes me lean towards it being legitimate.\n\nHowever, I shouldn't dismiss the possibility of malicious activity outright. Sometimes attackers mimic normal processes to avoid detection. Could SDXHelper.exe be hijacked? Or could these files be part of a payload? The consistent naming and structure of the files, though, don't raise red flags for me right now. They seem tailored to specific features, which is what legitimate software would do.\n\nI also need to consider the number of events. There are 14 entries here, each creating a different file. While it's possible that this is part of a bulk update or installation process, such as when multiple plugins are being added at once, it's still worth noting. But without additional context like timestamps showing rapid creation or unusual access patterns, I don't see an immediate cause for concern.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\" which is a standard location for Office-related data and add-ins on Windows. This further supports the idea that this is normal behavior because Office apps typically store their package resources there.\n\nI should also think about whether these files are signed or if their creation could indicate supply chain attacks, but without checksums or hashes in the logs, it's hard to assess. However, the structure of the paths and filenames doesn't suggest any anomalies that would point towards tampered files.\n\nIn summary, considering all these points—the consistent process name, the nature of the task (file creation), the specific file locations and names within known structures—it seems more likely than not that this batch is part of normal Office operations. Unless there's additional evidence indicating otherwise, such as unusual access times or deviations from expected patterns, I wouldn't classify this as interesting for investigation.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this batch isn't particularly concerning, but it's always good to keep an eye on any changes in file creation patterns if they deviate from the norm.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file creation activities by the Microsoft Office-related process SDXHelper.exe, creating known package resources.

Each JSON object has three main keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nThe 'process' key contains the name of the process that caused the event. In all these events, the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That seems consistent across all entries.\n\nNext, the 'winlog' key indicates the type of task or operation logged. Here, every entry has \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, this means each event is logging a file creation action triggered by SDXHelper.exe.\n\nThe 'file' key provides the path to the file that was created. Looking at the paths, they all point to files located in various subdirectories under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\". These files have names like \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay_0610e48aa6403fd8dac18ee075133afe.js\" and \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" followed by different hashes or identifiers.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries with the same file paths. For example, several events have the path ending with \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay_0610e48aa6403fd8dac18ee075133afe.js\" and others with various \"excel-copilot-strings_\" files. This repetition suggests that the same file is being created multiple times, perhaps during different instances or processes.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, I need to assess whether this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. \n\nSDXHelper.exe is likely related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which are used for add-ins and other supplementary features. These packages often include JavaScript files (JS) as part of their resources, especially for web-based components or Copilot features.\n\nThe fact that the same process is creating multiple files in a short time frame might raise some flags, but it's essential to determine if this behavior is normal or indicative of malicious activity. \n\nI should consider whether SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick mental note: yes, I recall that SDXHelper is part of Microsoft Office and handles the installation and management of Office Solution packages. Therefore, it's expected for this process to create files in the specified locations when installing or updating add-ins.\n\nThe file paths are all within standard user directories under AppData, which is a common location for application data. The files being created are JavaScript resources, which again aligns with typical behavior for Office add-ins and web-based components.\n\nLooking at the frequency of these events: there are 15 entries in total, each indicating the creation of a specific JS file. Some files are duplicated, like the \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay...\" file appearing twice, and various \"excel-copilot-strings_\" files multiple times. This duplication could be due to multiple instances or retries during the installation process.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see anything immediately suspicious here. The process is legitimate, the action being logged is a standard file creation, and the locations are expected for such files. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, encryption, deletion, or other signs of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate processes for their activities. But in this case, since all events are related to the same process creating expected types of files in known directories, there doesn't seem to be any deviation from normal behavior.\n\nAnother angle is to consider whether these file creations could be part of a broader attack chain, like a beaconing communication or data exfiltration. However, given that each event is just a file creation by a legitimate process and the files themselves are static resources (JS files), this doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nMoreover, the paths don't point to any system-critical locations; they're all within user-specific directories under Office's Solution Packages. There's no indication of attempts to write to restricted areas or alter system configurations.\n\nI should also think about whether multiple file creations could overload resources or cause performance issues. While having 15 such events might be notable, it's still within the realm of possible legitimate activity during a software update or installation process.\n\nIn summary, each event is individually normal and expected for the SDXHelper.exe process. The repetition is due to the nature of how Office packages are handled, and there's no evidence suggesting malicious intent or unusual behavior across the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by a legitimate Microsoft Office process, SDXHelper.exe, creating expected JavaScript resources in standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object indicating that the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" has created a file in specific paths under the Office Solution Packages directory.\n\nFirst, I notice that all events are from the same process, \"SDXHelper.exe\", which suggests it's part of normal Microsoft Office operations since I'm familiar with similar processes handling office-related tasks. The task is consistently a file creation event, so it's not something unusual like deletion or modification without cause.\n\nThe file paths point to various JavaScript files within an \"OfflineFiles\" directory. These look like string resource files related to Excel Copilot features. Such files are typical in Office setups for storing localized strings and other resources used by the application. The filenames vary, each with different hashes, which probably indicates different versions or updates of these resources.\n\nLooking at the timestamps might help, but since they're not provided, I have to rely on the context. Multiple file creations from the same process could be part of an update routine or initial setup. Given that all events are similar and repeat for the same type of files, it doesn't raise red flags. There's no evidence of unusual access patterns, such as writes to unexpected locations or attempts to execute these files.\n\nI also consider the possibility of log spamming, but since each event is a legitimate file creation, it seems more like standard operation rather than an attack vector. Malware typically does something more covert or destructive, which isn't apparent here.\n\nOverall, while the number of events might seem high, they all fit within expected behavior for Microsoft Office's setup and updates. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system changes beyond what's typical.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory for string resources, indicating normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is relevant for investigation. I need to consider all the events together and decide whether it's \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the logs, each line seems to be an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The paths are all within the user's AppData Local folder under Microsoft Office Solution Packages. Each event has a different JavaScript file being created in the OfflineFiles directory. For example, one creates excel-copilot-strings_78e259be1b68f3f3ddb9114118cde491.js and another does 8a7f699c570fdc82677ebd5ebd4a5cde.js, among others.\n\nI notice that each file path is unique but follows a similar naming convention. The process name repeats across all events, which suggests it's part of the same application or service. I see one event where the process is \"MdSched.exe\" setting a registry value, but the rest are all SDXHelper.\n\nFirst thought: Is SDXHelper.exe a known legitimate process? From what I recall, Microsoft Office applications sometimes have helper processes. The path structure looks like it's related to Office Solution Packages, which might be add-ins or custom solutions for Excel.\n\nThe fact that multiple JavaScript files are being created in an OfflineFiles directory makes me think they're part of the Copilot feature in Excel, as those strings include \"copilot\". These files could be cached or stored for offline use. The repeated creation of different JS files might just be normal behavior when adding or updating these resources.\n\nBut wait, why are there multiple events creating the same file? For example, I see two entries for excel-copilot-strings_78e259be1b68f3f3ddb9114118cde491.js. Maybe it's a retry or part of an update process. Alternatively, if this were malicious, perhaps the attacker is trying to write multiple files quickly.\n\nHowever, since all events are from the same process and in a standard Office directory, it seems less likely to be malicious. Unless there's something unusual about the file names or paths. I don't see any obvious signs of encoding or obfuscation in the file names; they appear to be hashes or random strings as part of their naming.\n\nAnother angle: The fact that multiple files are being created could indicate some form of lateral movement or data exfiltration, but again, within an Office context, it's more likely normal. Malicious actors often use different methods and wouldn't limit themselves to creating JS files in this specific directory structure.\n\nThe presence of a single event from MdSched.exe setting a registry value is also notable. MdSched is related to Windows Defender, I believe, so that could be part of legitimate system activity. No indication here that it's doing anything suspicious beyond its usual tasks.\n\nConsidering all events together, the repetition and structure point towards normal Office-related file operations. There's no evidence of unusual access times, multiple processes writing to different locations, or any signs of privilege escalation in these logs. The same process is consistently creating files in a known Microsoft directory.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described align with expected behavior from legitimate Office operations, specifically related to Copilot features.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by a legitimate Microsoft Office process in a standard directory, indicating normal operation rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on the system.\n\nLooking at each line, they all have similar structures: process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", task \"File created\", and file paths that seem pretty long but follow a pattern. The file paths are under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local... and end with various .js files like excel-copilot-strings followed by different hash-like strings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. I'm not familiar off the top of my head, so maybe it's a legitimate system or application helper process. It could be part of Microsoft Office since the path includes \"Microsoft\" and \"Office\". So perhaps this is related to an Office add-in or package.\n\nThe task in each event is a file creation. That's a common action for many processes, especially those that manage packages or extensions. In Office, it's normal for helper processes to create files when installing or updating add-ins. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all go into \"OfflineFiles\" and have specific naming conventions with hashes. This suggests these are temporary or cached files used by Excel's Copilot feature. The repeated creation of similar files makes me think this might be part of a background update process.\n\nNow, considering whether this is suspicious: SDXHelper.exe seems like a legitimate process. The file operations are creating files in an expected location for Office packages. I don't see any signs of unusual paths or behaviors that would indicate malicious activity here. Each event just reports a file being created by the same process, which aligns with normal operation.\n\nHowever, since there are multiple identical events, maybe it's worth checking if this is part of a loop or an error where the files are being recreated unnecessarily. But without more context on what's normal for this system, I can't say for sure.\n\nOverall, while it's always good to monitor repeated file operations, in this case, they don't seem out of the ordinary. The process and actions align with expected behavior for an Office-related helper.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe within a legitimate Microsoft Office directory, likely related to Excel's Copilot feature.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the majority of the logs are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path related to Microsoft Office Offline Files. The same process is creating multiple JavaScript files with varying names, all under the same directory structure. This looks like normal operation for an application that might be downloading or caching resources, especially since they're part of Office features like Excel Copilot and Office AI.\n\nThere's also one event where \"cleanmgr.exe\" is started. That's a known system process used for cleaning up files, so it doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they don't exhibit signs of malicious activity. They're consistent with legitimate operations, especially within the Microsoft Office context. There's no evidence of unusual access times, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from expected behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation activities by a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe) and do not indicate any malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that all the events have the same structure: the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task is \"File created\" under the Windows log, and the file path points to various JavaScript files in an Office SolutionPackage directory. Each event creates a different JavaScript file with varying filenames but following a similar pattern.\n\nI'm wondering why there are so many identical events. It seems like each line represents the creation of a specific JS file by SDXHelper.exe. The same process name and task suggest it's part of normal operations, possibly related to Office add-ins or Copilot features. Since these files are in an OfflineFiles subdirectory, they might be cached or local copies used when online access isn't available.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple identical events are present could indicate something suspicious, like a script or process generating many files quickly, which might be part of malicious activity such as file injection or persistence mechanisms. On the other hand, it's also possible that this is just normal behavior for an application updating or caching resources.\n\nI should check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known to be associated with any malicious activities. A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office and used for features like Copilot. This suggests it's a legitimate process, so the file creations are likely part of normal operations.\n\nAnother point to consider: each event has slightly different filenames but follows a predictable naming convention. If these were arbitrary or random names, that might raise more flags. Since they're structured, it seems organized rather than random, which is typical for legitimate processes managing resources.\n\nBut I'm still cautious because the exact same process creating multiple files in quick succession could be part of an attack vector. Maybe a malicious script is using this process to drop several files as part of an infection chain.\n\nI also think about how these events cluster together. If they're all happening around the same time, it might indicate that something triggered the creation of many files quickly, which isn't usual for normal operations. Office applications usually don't create so many files at once unless there's a bulk operation or an update happening.\n\nAdditionally, considering the user context (\"fiddelis\" in this case), if this user is known within the organization and their activity aligns with typical usage patterns, it might not be suspicious. But without knowing more about the user's behavior, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm also wondering if there are any other logs around this time that could provide context. For example, were there network connections or other processes running alongside SDXHelper.exe? Without additional data, I have to make assumptions based solely on these events.\n\nIn summary, while the activities seem legitimate at first glance because they involve a known Microsoft-related process and structured file naming, the sheer number of identical events in quick succession raises some red flags. It's possible that this is normal behavior for certain Office features, but it could also be indicative of malicious activity attempting to blend in with legitimate operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe targeting various JavaScript files within an Office package resource directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. All the entries are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. The files being created have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" with varying suffixes.\n\nFirst, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office and is part of the Office add-ins or solutions. It's responsible for managing offline files, which makes sense given the file paths under \"OfflineFiles\". The repeated creation of these specific JavaScript files could be part of normal operations when downloading or updating content for Office features like AI Copilot.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this activity is unusual. Since all events are consistent and involve expected file operations by a legitimate process, there's no indication of malicious intent here.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to be an event with some details about processes and file creations.\n\nFirst off, the first event is from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory with a .yml extension. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration or updating it. So that's probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, I notice multiple events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". All of these are creating files under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages path. The file names all follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by different hashes. This looks repetitive—each event is SDXHelper creating another string file in the same location.\n\nI'm trying to think if this kind of activity is typical. Well, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office add-ins or perhaps some update mechanism. The fact that multiple files are being created with varying hashes might just be part of a normal process, like downloading or updating resources for Excel add-ins.\n\nBut wait, why so many files? If these are legitimate parts of an Office package update, then this is expected behavior. However, if the same process is creating a large number of unexpected files quickly, it could indicate something malicious, like file injection or tampering.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the \"OfflineFiles\" folder within Office's SolutionPackages. That seems to be a standard place for storing resources that are used when Office is offline. So unless there's an unusual number of files being created, which could be a sign of something gone wrong, this might not be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Are these file hashes known? If they're related to the Excel Copilot feature, which was introduced in recent updates, then their presence would make sense. But if these hashes don't match known legitimate files, that's when it becomes concerning.\n\nI'm also thinking about the process names. winlogbeat.exe is likely part of an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management, so its activity is standard in a system with logging setup.\n\nThe repetition of \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating multiple files is the key here. If this is part of a normal update cycle, it's not interesting. But if the volume or frequency is abnormal, it could be malicious. Since I don't have data on how many such files are typically created, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAlso, considering that each event is just a file creation without any other indicators like access or deletion patterns, there's no evidence of misuse here. It seems purely about creating files.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity is notable due to the repetitive nature, there's not enough information to classify it as malicious.

It might be a legitimate application or part of an Office package since the file paths are within Microsoft's Office Solution Packages. The repeated creation of multiple JS files with similar names suggests that this could be related to how resources are being loaded by the application. These JS files often contain strings used in localization, which explains the naming pattern.\n\nI need to consider if creating these files is normal behavior for SDXHelper.exe. If it's part of a legitimate process during Office setup or updates, then these events might not be suspicious. However, multiple file creations without any other context could raise an eyebrow, especially since each event creates two identical JS files before moving on to the next. This duplication might indicate some form of testing or caching behavior, but without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all lead to the same parent directory but different filenames. The consistent pattern in the filenames suggests that these are not arbitrary; perhaps they're being generated by a script or part of an update process. Legitimate software often creates temporary files during updates or installations, so this might be within normal operations.\n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious, then creating multiple JS files could be suspicious. But based on my current knowledge, I don't have evidence that this specific process is associated with malware. The lack of any other event types (like deletions or modifications) in this batch also makes it less concerning.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, while there are red flags like repeated file creation and duplication, without additional context or indicators of compromise, it's challenging to definitively classify these events as malicious.

The repeated file creations could be part of a normal update process, especially since they're in the OfflineFiles directory, which might cache files for offline use.\n\nHowever, the number of events is quite high—15 instances where the same process creates multiple files with different hashes each time. While this could be legitimate if it's an update or installation routine, it might also indicate something suspicious like a script generating numerous files to create noise or hide malicious activity.\n\nAnother angle is that creating many small files in a short period can sometimes be a tactic for data exfiltration or to trigger certain security mechanisms. But without more context on the frequency of these events and whether they're part of the expected behavior, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI also wonder why multiple files with similar names but different hashes are being created. If this is normal for Office updates, then it's not suspicious. But if the process isn't supposed to create so many files quickly, that could be a red flag.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because SDXHelper.exe seems tied to legitimate Microsoft processes. The repetitive file creation appears related to resource package updates or cache activities, which are typical in software operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the same process (SDXHelper.exe) creating files in a known Microsoft Office directory.

So I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all seem pretty similar. Each line has a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation task from Windows log, and a specific file path. The paths are all under the same directory but have different filenames with varying hashes in their names.\n\nHmm, so the process is creating multiple files in quick succession. That could be normal if it's part of a legitimate application updating or caching resources. But I should check what \"SDXHelper.exe\" does. Maybe it's related to Office applications since the path includes Microsoft and Office directories. It sounds like it's part of some package resources, possibly for add-ins or language packs.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many file creation events? Each event is a separate file being created. That might indicate something suspicious if these files are being generated quickly or in large numbers. However, if this is a legitimate process, maybe it's just downloading multiple resources as part of an update or initial setup.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have hashes like \"6bce757cc270c1ada438b863338d0d2f.js\". Hashes often relate to versioning or file integrity checks. So maybe each of these files is a different resource being saved, and it's normal for an application to create several such files during setup.\n\nBut then again, I should consider the frequency. There are 14 events in this batch. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is running multiple times or creating many files quickly, that could be a sign of something malicious like a script generating files rapidly as part of a payload.\n\nWait, but all these events have almost identical structure except for the filename. That makes me think it's the same process repeatedly writing files in the same directory. Maybe this is an Office-related process handling offline content or cache files.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is normal behavior for \"SDXHelper.exe\". I should check if there's any information about this executable being known for creating multiple JavaScript files in such a path. If it's part of Microsoft's official software, then these events might be standard operations. But without that knowledge, the repeated file creation could raise flags.\n\nAlso, considering the paths are under \"AppData\", which is a common location for application data, but some malware also targets this area to store files. The combination of same process name and multiple similar file writes could indicate either normal operation or malicious activity trying to establish persistence or load resources.\n\nIn terms of confidence: I'm leaning towards it being interesting because the number of events is high, and all are from the same process creating many files quickly. However, without knowing the exact behavior of \"SDXHelper.exe\", there's a chance it's legitimate. Maybe an Office add-in or language pack update.\n\nBut given that each event is nearly identical except for filenames, which suggests repetitive actions by the same process, I'm more inclined to think this might be suspicious. The files being created are JavaScript, and while many scripts can be benign, they could also be part of a malicious payload.\n\nSo after considering all these points, I'd classify it as INTERESTING because the repeated file creation by the same process in the same directory with varying JS files raises some red flags. There's enough uncertainty to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from the same process suggest potential malicious activity or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object representing some file creation activity by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". I notice that there are multiple entries with very similar paths and filenames, but slightly different hashes in their names.\n\nFirst off, the fact that all these events come from the same process suggests they might be related to normal software operations. SDXHelper.exe is likely a legitimate tool, possibly associated with Microsoft Office's setup or updates since the file paths are within the Office Solution Packages directory. These packages usually contain resources like JavaScript files needed for features such as Copilot.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of similar file creation events might indicate that the system is downloading or updating these files. It's common for applications to create multiple resource files during installation or update processes. The variations in the filenames with different hashes (like \"c62d76d06f0f547a17fe8ca50b485ab5.js\") could be versions of the same file being downloaded sequentially.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, such as unusual paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or multiple failed operations that might indicate a breach. The consistency in the process name and task type also points towards normal behavior rather than something suspicious.\n\nHowever, it's possible for legitimate processes to exhibit behaviors that could look suspicious at first glance if not understood properly. Since all these events fit within expected patterns of an Office-related application updating its resources, there doesn't seem to be any cause for alarm here.\n\nTherefore, considering the entire batch together, these logs likely don't require further investigation as they appear to be part of a legitimate update or installation process by Microsoft Office components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process, which appears to be associated with legitimate Microsoft Office operations.

Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nAll the events have the same structure: they're created by \"SDXHelper.exe\" and involve file creation tasks under Windows. The files being created are located in the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames seem to follow a pattern with GUIDs and version-like suffixes, which is typical for software components.\n\nI notice that several events create the same files repeatedly. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_d2a01ab8f8d7605cd831c73c13f130ca.js\" is created twice, and similar patterns follow for other files. This repetition suggests that it's part of a normal software process, possibly during updates or installations.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is known to be related to Microsoft Office, handling tasks like package management. The creation of these JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory likely supports features like Copilot within Office applications. Since these activities are standard for such system processes, they don't raise any red flags indicating malicious behavior.\n\nThere's no indication of unusual access times, file paths outside expected locations, or signs of unauthorized processes.

My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The output should be just one classification with a justification and confidence score.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements are:\n\n- The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\".\n- The task in the winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\".\n- The file path varies slightly but follows the same pattern: it's within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office, specifically in the SolutionPackages folder. Each event creates a new file with different hashes after the filename.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From my knowledge, this might be related to software like Microsoft Office add-ins or perhaps some system utility. It's not immediately suspicious on its own since it's a common process name.\n\nEach event indicates that a file was created. The files are located in the OfflineFiles subdirectory of PackageResources. The filenames have consistent patterns but different suffixes, likely indicating different versions or configurations of the same resource.\n\nNow, considering the batch as a whole: there are multiple events (16 to be exact) all from the same process creating files in the same directory with similar naming conventions. This could be normal behavior if this is part of an update or cache refresh process. However, I should check for any anomalies.\n\nLooking closer, each file path points to a JavaScript file with varying hashes at the end of the filename. The repeated creation suggests that perhaps these are temporary files being generated during some operation. Alternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, it might be part of an update or patching process, creating new versions of resources.\n\nBut why would there be so many identical events? If each file creation is necessary and part of a normal process, like caching multiple JavaScript files for an Office add-in, then this might not be suspicious. On the other hand, if these files are being created rapidly or in large numbers without a legitimate reason, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known malware. A quick search in my knowledge base doesn't flag this as malicious, so that's a point towards it not being suspicious.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers use legitimate processes for their activities. If these files are created with specific naming conventions or contain malicious content, that could be concerning. But without inspecting the file contents, I can't make that determination here.\n\nThe paths also seem standard, under the user's AppData directory, which is a common place for application data. Malicious actors might use such locations, but it's not inherently suspicious.\n\nGiven all this, while there's some cause for caution because of the repetitive nature and specific file operations, without additional context or indicators of compromise (like known malicious hashes, unusual file permissions, or execution behavior), I lean towards classifying this batch as NOT INTERESTING. The activities described seem to align with normal operations, possibly part of an update or cache process.\n\nConfidence is about 0.7 because there's a reasonable chance these could be legitimate actions, but if more context were available (like file hashes matching known threats), it might increase the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a standard directory, likely part of normal Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}

Let's see what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, every entry has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That seems suspicious because it's a recurring process, but maybe it's legitimate. The winlog task says \"File created\", so each event is about creating a file.\n\nThe files are being created in paths under \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\\". That looks like a standard directory for Office add-ins or temporary solution packages. Each path has a GUID-like string, followed by \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\", and the filenames vary but end with .js.\n\nHmm, I'm noticing that some file paths are repeated. For example, one event writes to a path ending with \"_af_46ff5943d6963f95d5aaa582c21b4928.js\" and another the same day creates the same file again. Wait, is that possible? Can a file be created multiple times in the same location?\n\nAlso, all these files are JavaScript files. Since .js files can execute code when run, especially if they're part of malicious scripts, this could be concerning. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at how many events there are: seven entries, each with the same process and task but different file paths. The repetition might indicate a pattern, like multiple files being written by the same process. Could this be normal behavior for an Office add-in or some legitimate application?\n\nOn the other hand, if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is part of a known malware family, then creating several .js files could be malicious. But I'm not certain without more context.\n\nI should consider that sometimes legitimate processes do create multiple temporary files. For example, during updates or cache generation, applications might write several files in quick succession. So, maybe these events are normal.\n\nBut why is each event for a file creation?
