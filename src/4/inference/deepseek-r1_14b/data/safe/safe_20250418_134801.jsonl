Setup executables often create pipes for communication during installation processes, so this isn't alarming.\n\nThe services.exe and related events with logon tasks are standard for system services starting up. Special logons usually refer to background processes or services, which is normal.\n\nA lot of User Account Management events—these are common when the system is handling user sessions or group policies, so no cause for concern.\n\nAn event where taskhostw.exe loads taskschd.dll makes sense since Task Scheduler uses this DLL.\n\nThere's a powershell.exe command executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. It's querying .inf files looking for specific patterns, which might be part of system scanning or updates. The command line is somewhat unusual but could be a legitimate script checking configurations. However, restricted execution policies are often used by malicious scripts to avoid detection, so this needs closer scrutiny.\n\nMultiple events from svchost.exe modifying the registry aren't suspicious on their own since many services run under svchost.

The user mentioned that it's in JSONL format, which stands for JSON Lines. So, each line is its own JSON object.\n\nLooking at the structure of each event, they all seem similar. They have three main parts: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The process has a name, which is \"git.exe\" every time. That's consistent across all events, so nothing unusual there—it looks like Git is being used here.\n\nThe winlog section notes the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", meaning that each event corresponds to a file creation action. So, we're seeing multiple files being created by git.exe.\n\nNow, looking at the \"file\" part, it has a \"path\". All paths are under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\", which seems to be a directory related to a course or project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Under this directory, there's a \"node_modules\" folder, which is typical for Node.js projects because node_modules contains all the dependencies.\n\nEach event creates different files. For example, one creates \"env.d.ts\", another \"env.js\", and so on. These are standard file types for JavaScript and TypeScript projects—like configuration files (tsconfig.json), package managers (package.json), READMEs, licenses, and module-specific index files like index.js or index.d.ts.\n\nI also notice that the modules being created include names like \"set-function-length\", \"shebang-command\", \"shebang-regex\", and \"side-channel\". These all sound like npm packages. For instance, \"shebang\" is a common prefix for tools related to shebang lines in files, which manage execution environments.\n\nSince all events are under the same process (git.exe) and involve creating standard Node.js project files, this looks like a normal setup or update of a Node.js environment. Git is often used with npm packages because projects rely on version control for their dependencies as well.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unusual file paths, access to restricted areas, or creation of hidden files. All the actions are typical when setting up or modifying a software project that uses Node.js and npm.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, this batch of events doesn't raise any red flags.

These look like standard npm package directories.\n\nI know that when you clone a repository or install dependencies using npm, it's normal for many files to be created in the node_modules folder. The filenames like LICENSE, README.md, package.json are all typical for npm modules. Since all these events involve git.exe and creating files under node_modules, this seems like regular activity during a development process.\n\nThere’s nothing unusual here—no signs of file creation in unexpected locations or multiple writes to sensitive areas.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first line: it's a JSON object with \"process\" name as git.exe, a file creation event from winlog, and the file path is something like C:\\Users\\... under node_modules\/slice-ansi\/readme.md. So that seems normal because Git often clones repositories which have node_modules folders.\n\nThe next few lines follow a similar pattern. They all involve git.exe creating files in various subdirectories of the same node_modules folder, specifically for \"sshpk\". Each event is just creating a file like .travis.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc., or binary files and JavaScript modules within the lib directory.\n\nI know that when Git clones a repository, it creates a lot of files under the node_modules if there are dependencies. These events look like standard parts of the cloning process. The filenames and paths make sense for a typical Node.js project structure.\n\nThere's no indication of anything unusual here. No failed processes, access to restricted areas, or multiple attempts that might indicate brute force.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. So, I've got a batch of events here, all in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which tells me this activity is related to Git, a version control system. The winlog task mentions \"File created\" with a specific rule, indicating that a new file was made.\n\nThe file paths are all under the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\sshpk\\... and so on. I know that node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored, and 'sshpk' seems to be one of those modules. The files being created include various .js files, man pages, and even some .1 files which are likely manual pages for command-line tools.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It looks like Git is cloning or fetching a repository that includes the sshpk package. Node modules are typically downloaded when you run npm install or during a build process. The creation of multiple files under node_modules suggests that this is part of installing dependencies for a project.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file permissions, or execution of scripts. All the events are related to normal package installation processes. However, I should consider if there's anything unusual about the sshpk module itself. From what I recall, sshpk is a Node.js library for handling SSH keys, which isn't inherently suspicious but could be misused.\n\nBut in this context, since all events are about creating files under node_modules and the process is git.exe, it seems like standard development activity. There's no evidence of any exfiltration, encryption, or other red flags that would indicate ransomware or malware.\n\nTherefore, while monitoring such activities is good practice to catch anomalies, in this case, there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. The confidence level is high because all events fit a pattern consistent with legitimate software installation and dependency management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which appears to be part of normal package installation or repository cloning.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's look at each event.\n\nEach line starts with a JSON object indicating the process name is \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog field says it's a file creation event triggered by the FileCreate rule. Then there's a file path listed, all under the same user directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules... and various package names like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc.\n\nHmm, so \"git.exe\" is creating multiple files in a node_modules folder. That seems normal because when you clone a repository with Node.js packages, git might be involved in checking out the files or managing submodules. The file paths are typical for npm modules, which suggests this is part of a development environment setup.\n\nI'm noticing that each event creates a different file under node_modules, like package.json, index.js, readme.md, etc. These are standard files you'd expect when installing dependencies with npm. So multiple FileCreate events by git.exe in the node_modules directory likely indicate that the system is setting up or updating these packages.\n\nThere's no indication of anything unusual here. No signs of file creation outside expected directories, no suspicious filenames, and all activities align with normal software development processes. The user account is fiddelis, which presumably has permission to install these modules.\n\nSince all events are related to the same process and follow a predictable pattern for npm package installations, I don't see any red flags that would make this batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events show \"git.exe\" creating multiple files in a node_modules directory as part of normal software setup, indicating no suspicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during the setup of Node.js modules, which is expected behavior in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events that were provided. Each event is a JSON object with some information about a file creation event on a Windows system. The process name in each case is \"git.exe\", which immediately makes me think that Git is involved here. \n\nLooking closer, the files being created are all within a path that includes \"node_modules\". That's a telltale sign of a Node.js project because node_modules is where npm packages get installed. The specific files being created include things like package.json, index.js, and README.md, which are standard in npm modules. So these look like they're part of the npm installation process.\n\nEach event reports that a file was created by Git. Since Git is often used for version control in development projects, it's common to see it interacting with files in node_modules when dependencies are being managed or cloned from repositories. It doesn't seem unusual that Git would create these files as part of initializing or updating the modules.\n\nI'm also noticing that all these events have similar structures and involve the same process name and task type. There's no variation in the file types or any signs of accessing sensitive areas beyond the node_modules directory, which is typical for development environments. \n\nNo red flags are popping up here. The activities align with standard operations during software development, specifically with Node.js projects using npm. Without any indicators of malicious behavior like access to restricted files, unusual process names, or unexpected file creation in sensitive locations, there's no reason to flag this batch as interesting for investigation.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, it seems clear that this batch doesn't indicate any suspicious activity and is likely just normal development work.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files within a Node.js project's node_modules directory, which is typical during development or dependency management.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a set of JSONL logs to analyze. The task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that every event has the same process name: \"git.exe\". That immediately makes me think of Git, which is a version control system commonly used in development environments. So these logs are related to Git operations.\n\nThe winlog field mentions that each event is a file creation (rule: FileCreate). So it's about files being created on the system. The file paths all point to \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\\" followed by various filenames like index.d.ts, index.js, and several .js files under the lib directory.\n\nWait a minute, node_modules is a folder typically found in Node.js projects. It's where third-party libraries are stored. So this looks like someone installing or updating dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager), which often involves creating or modifying files within node_modules.\n\nEach event is a file creation by git.exe. That's interesting because Git itself isn't usually involved in managing node_modules. Normally, npm install would handle that. Maybe the user ran some script or command that triggered Git to interact with these files.\n\nI should consider if this activity is normal. Developers often use Git alongside Node.js projects, but when does it become suspicious? If someone is working on a project, cloning repositories, or installing packages, such file creations are standard. However, in a corporate environment, especially one handling sensitive data, frequent writes to node_modules might be monitored.\n\nBut looking at the files being created—these seem like they're part of the tcomb library. Tcomb is a TypeScript framework for building strongly-typed applications. The presence of .js and .d.ts files suggests this is during a build process or installation where source maps are generated.\n\nAnother angle: Could Git's involvement here be a red flag? Maybe an attacker using Git to exfiltrate data, but the paths seem legitimate and related to software development tools. There's no indication of unusual file names or locations outside typical project structures.\n\nThe frequency of events is also something to note. There are 19 entries all within the same directory and created by git.exe. That might be a bit concerning if it happened in quick succession without an obvious cause, but again, it could just be part of a build process.\n\nI should think about the user context. If this activity came from a non-standard user account or during off-hours when no development is expected, that would raise more flags. But as per the logs provided, there's no indication of such anomalies.\n\nThe justification for classification: Since all events are file creations by Git in a node_modules directory related to a project on the local drive, this seems like normal development activity. There's no evidence of malicious intent or unauthorized access here. Therefore, it's not particularly concerning from a cybersecurity standpoint unless there's additional context indicating otherwise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch isn't interesting in terms of security threats but is more about typical software development processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch of logs does not indicate any suspicious or malicious activity. All events are related to the creation of files within a Node.js project directory (`node_modules\/tcomb`) by Git.exe, which is consistent with normal development operations such as installing dependencies or building projects. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other security-relevant actions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification**: All events involve `git.exe`, a legitimate tool used for version control.\n2. **File Operations**: Each event logs a file creation in the `node_modules\/tcomb` directory, which is typical when managing third-party libraries.\n3. **Context of Node.js Projects**: The presence of `node_modules` suggests this relates to a JavaScript\/TypeScript project, common in development environments.\n4. **No Signs of Malware or Exploitation**: The file paths and names do not indicate any malicious code or scripts.\n5. **Frequency and Timing**: While multiple entries are present, they don't exceed what's expected during a build or install process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs represent standard file creation activities during software development, posing no cybersecurity threat. Therefore, the batch is **not interesting** from a security perspective."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if they're interesting or not. Let's take a closer look.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three main parts: process info, winlog details, and file information.

That suggests these are file creation events.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to files inside a node_modules folder, specifically within the tcomb library. Paths like \"dict.js\", \"enums.js\", etc., indicate that Git is creating these files as part of its process.

The user is asking me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. They've provided multiple JSONL entries where the process name is git.exe, the task is file creation under specific paths within a node_modules directory.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each one shows that git.exe created a new file in different JavaScript files under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\. These are all standard files related to the tcomb library, which is a type-checking module for Node.js.\n\nNow, considering the batch as a whole, I notice that there are multiple file creation events in quick succession. Since git.exe is commonly used for version control, this could be part of a normal development workflow—cloning a repository or installing dependencies. The files created are typical parts of a node_modules setup, which suggests that this activity is related to software development rather than anything malicious.\n\nI should check if these file creations happen during legitimate operations. In development environments, especially with tools like npm or yarn, it's common for many files to be created or updated as part of the build or install process. The presence of .js and .d.ts files further supports this since they're standard in JavaScript projects.\n\nAnother point is the consistency in the file paths. All events are under the same directory structure, indicating a systematic process rather than random writes which might hint at malicious activity. There's no evidence of access to sensitive files or unusual patterns that would raise red flags.\n\nAdditionally, considering the source process (git.exe), it's a well-known and widely used tool, so activities related to it are generally benign unless there's an irregularity in how it's being used. Here, each event is straightforward—file creation without any signs of deletion or modification immediately after, which could indicate exfiltration or tampering.\n\nI should also think about the user context. The files are located under a Downloads directory within a \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\" folder, which sounds like an academic course or project. This suggests that this might be a student's environment where they're working on software projects, making these activities even more benign.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the timestamps (though not provided) would help determine if the file creations are happening over a short period or spread out, but given the uniformity and known process, it's safe to assume normal behavior.\n\nIn summary, all events point towards legitimate development activity. The repeated file creation by git.exe in a node_modules directory for standard library files doesn't indicate any malicious intent or unusual system behavior that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe under a typical development environment path, indicating normal software installation or updates rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
