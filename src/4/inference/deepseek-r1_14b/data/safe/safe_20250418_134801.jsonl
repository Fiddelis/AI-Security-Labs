This suggests that Git is downloading or updating the 'semver' package as part of a Node.js module installation. The various files like parse-options.js and ranges.js are typical for a JavaScript package's source code. \n\nI'm wondering if these events could be part of a malicious activity. Since they're all under node_modules, it's likely just normal package installations or updates.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, all these events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Looking at the first few lines, they all have similar structures: \"process\" with name \"git.exe\", \"winlog\" indicating that a file was created, and \"file\" showing the path of the file.\n\nHmm, so git.exe is a common tool used for version control. People use it to clone repositories, checkout files, commit changes, etc. The fact that multiple files are being created by git.exe seems normal during operations like cloning or initializing a repository.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\" which looks like a directory for a course or project. The specific files being created are things like LICENSE, README.md, package.json, and others typical in a node_modules folder. This suggests that someone is setting up a Node.js project here.\n\nI remember that when you clone a repository using git, especially one that uses npm (Node Package Manager), it often downloads and installs dependencies into the node_modules directory. Each time a new file or package is added, git might record those as separate events, hence multiple FileCreate log entries.\n\nSince all these events are about creating files related to a software project, and they're all coming from git.exe, which is expected behavior during development, there doesn't seem to be anything malicious here. No signs of unusual file paths, executable being run in unexpected locations, or access to sensitive areas beyond what's typical for a developer setup.\n\nI'm also thinking about the possibility of data exfiltration or privilege escalation, but these logs don't show any attempts to copy files out or modify system configurations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of system log events from Windows, each in JSONL format. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, each one involves the process \"git.exe\" creating files. The paths mentioned are all within a directory structure that includes things like node_modules, which suggests this is related to a Node.js project setup. The files being created include standard ones like LICENSE.txt, README.md, package.json, and others typical for a software project.\n\nI remember that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments where Node.js modules are managed. When someone clones a repository or installs dependencies using npm, it's normal to see multiple files being created under node_modules as the packages are extracted and installed.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures: the same process name, file creation tasks, and paths within the same project directory. There’s no indication of any unusual activity like access to restricted areas, attempts to execute scripts without proper reason, or files being modified in unexpected ways.\n\nI also consider whether these events could be part of a malicious activity. Typically, such logs would show signs of privilege escalation, multiple failed attempts, or the creation of suspicious files. Here, everything seems consistent with normal development practices—installing dependencies and setting up project structures.\n\nAdditionally, all the file paths are within a user's Downloads folder, under an \"inatel\" directory, which sounds like it could be related to a specific course or project (S206 - Qualidade de Software). This context supports the idea that these events are part of legitimate software development work rather than anything malicious.\n\nSo, after reviewing each event and considering their collective nature, I don't see any red flags.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process field always shows \"git.exe\" as the name, which indicates that Git is being used.

For example, one path is \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\sshpk\\\\package.json\". This tells me that Git is creating files inside a Node.js modules folder.\n\nGiven that these are all standard operations during a development workflow—cloning repositories, installing dependencies, or building projects—it doesn't raise any red flags. These activities are typical for someone using Git in a development environment, especially with Node.js and npm packages involved.\n\nI don't see anything unusual like access to sensitive files, multiple failed login attempts, or system-level changes that could indicate malicious behavior.

It seems that git.exe is creating files in a node_modules directory under the user's Downloads folder. The file paths are all within the sshpk library and its subdirectories, like formats, man, etc.\n\nHmm, so this looks like git is cloning or updating a repository. Node modules are standard when dealing with JavaScript packages, especially if someone is working on a project that uses SSH keys or PKI (public key infrastructure), given the presence of files related to x509 and ssh in the paths.\n\nIs there anything suspicious about these events? Well, git.exe is commonly used for version control. The fact that it's creating multiple files under node_modules suggests that maybe this user is setting up a project or installing dependencies. There doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity here—no signs of executable creation outside the expected modules, no access to restricted areas, or anything related to known malware behavior.\n\nI should also consider if git.exe being used in this context could be part of a larger attack vector. Sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes, but in this case, it's just creating files within a project directory that seems standard for a developer working on an SSH-related toolset.\n\nThe frequency is 14 events, all happening around the same time, which aligns with git cloning or installing modules. There's no variation in the process name; they're all from git.exe. The file paths don't raise any red flags—node_modules are typically where third-party packages go, and sshpk is a legitimate library for handling SSH keys.\n\nSo considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem to indicate anything malicious or even unusual from a security standpoint.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements in all these are the process name \"git.exe\", the task as \"File created\" under winlog, and various file paths. The files being created are all within the node_modules directory of a folder named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Specifically, they're creating files in the sshpk module.\n\nFirst, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially with Node.js projects where npm modules like node_modules are standard. The events show multiple files being created under different subdirectories of sshpk, including .js files and some binary executables (like sshpk-sign and sshpk-verify).\n\nI'm thinking about what's normal here. When a developer is working on a project that uses Node.js, running git commands might involve cloning repositories or installing dependencies. Installing npm packages typically involves downloading and extracting modules into node_modules. So, the creation of multiple files in this directory by git.exe seems plausible during such activities.\n\nIs there anything unusual? The file paths look like standard module structures. There's nothing indicating suspicious behavior, like access to restricted areas or unexpected binaries. All the files are within a project-specific folder, which suggests it's part of a legitimate development process.\n\nI also consider if these events could be indicators of malicious activity. For example, creating many files quickly might indicate something like file injection or a drop by malware. However, given that all events come from git.exe and they're within a node_modules directory, this is more likely related to package installation rather than malicious behavior.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, attackers use legitimate tools for their activities. But in this case, the context seems too aligned with normal development operations. There's no evidence of file sizes being unusually large or files being created outside typical project structures.\n\nAlso, considering the frequency and number of events—14 in total—all related to creating files in a specific module—it doesn't seem excessive for a package install. Git might extract multiple files when pulling dependencies, especially if it's a deep clone or if many modules are being installed at once.\n\nSo putting it all together: the events show git.exe creating several files within a node_modules directory as part of what appears to be a standard Node.js project setup.

There's no indication of unusual behavior here. All the file paths are standard for node_modules, and git.exe is a common tool. Unless there's context that git.exe is being used abnormally in this environment, it's hard to justify marking this as interesting.\n\nPerhaps another angle: sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. But without evidence of deviations from normal patterns or signs like file sizes, timestamps, or unexpected locations, I shouldn't assume the worst.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each event on its own isn't suspicious, and collectively they form a consistent narrative of a development process. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by git.exe during the setup or update of node_modules in a development environment. These are typical and expected actions for software development tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
