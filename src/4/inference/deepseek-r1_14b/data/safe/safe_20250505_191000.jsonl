{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That's a bit repetitive, but not necessarily suspicious on its own—could just be normal process behavior.\n\nThen there are several events related to user account management with no associated file or process info. These might be legitimate system activities during logins or policy changes.\n\nThe \"rundll32.exe\" running shell32.dll seems a bit unusual, especially with the GUID in the command line. Rundll32 is often used for executing DLL functions, and while it's common, the specific GUID {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6} doesn't ring a bell as malicious, but I should verify if this is part of known legitimate processes.\n\nThe \"svchost.exe\" modifying the registry might be normal since it's a common system process used by services. However, frequent or unexpected changes could indicate issues, but there's no context here to suggest anything wrong.\n\n\"winlogbeat.exe\" creating files seems related to log management. It's probably part of their logging setup and not suspicious unless there are unusual file paths or access patterns, which don't appear here.\n\nExcel launching with specific command-line arguments is standard when opening files. The Dns query from Excel might be for resolving domains in the spreadsheet, which is typical unless it's accessing known malicious domains—nothing indicates that here.\n\n\"WmiPrvSE.exe\" loading wmiutils.dll could be normal as it's related to WMI services. However, sometimes malware uses WMI for persistence or lateral movement. The specific command line here doesn't show anything suspicious like unusual parameters.\n\nMultiple instances of user account management events without context make me think they might be part of a legitimate process, perhaps during script execution or batch operations, but without more data, it's hard to say.\n\n\"services.exe\" and \"Special Logon\" events are common in system startup and service management. These alone aren't red flags.\n\nPutting it all together: There's no clear indication of malicious activity across the logs. Most events seem routine, though a few could be points of interest with more context. Since none stand out as clearly suspicious when considered as a whole batch, I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mostly of normal system processes and activities such as file loading, registry changes, and user account management. While there are some unusual process names like 'rundll32.exe' with a specific command line and 'WmiPrvSE.exe', these do not indicate malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows that \"EXCEL.EXE\" created a file at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK\". This looks like an Excel process creating a shortcut file, which is normal user behavior. So nothing suspicious here yet.\n\n2. The second event is identical to the first one. Same process and action, so again, it's just another instance of Excel interacting with files in the same directory. Still seems okay.\n\n3. Next, there are three events where both \"process\" and \"file\" are null, and the task under winlog is \"None\". These might be log entries indicating no activity or perhaps some system-level checks that didn't trigger any specific action. I don't see an immediate red flag here; they could just be background processes or part of normal system logging.\n\n4. The fourth set of events (events 6,7,8) again show \"EXCEL.EXE\" but this time the task is a DNS query. So Excel is looking up some domain name. That's unusual because why would Excel need to perform a DNS query? Maybe it's trying to connect to an external resource or fetching data from the internet. This could be concerning as it might indicate communication with unauthorized servers or potentially malicious domains.\n\nNow, considering all events together: Two file creation events by Excel in the same path, followed by three null events, and then three DNS queries from Excel. The repetition of these actions is notable. Creating multiple files in a specific location might suggest some automated process or script activity. Additionally, the DNS queries could be attempting to reach certain domains that might not be legitimate, especially if they're repeated.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's just regular user behavior? For example, the user is working with Excel and saving files, then perhaps opening those files which could trigger DNS lookups for online resources or updates. However, seeing three separate DNS queries from Excel in quick succession does raise an eyebrow because standard usage might not involve so many queries.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps it's part of a script or macro execution within Excel that's fetching data over the network. If this is happening without user interaction, it could be suspicious. Also, the path where the files are being saved (\"Recent\") suggests they're related to the user's recent documents, which might not inherently be malicious but could be if those files contain malicious content.\n\nI should also consider the null events. Maybe these represent failed attempts or other system processes that aren't directly tied to Excel's actions. They don't add much in terms of concern on their own but combined with the other events, they just serve as background noise.\n\nPutting it all together: The repetition of file creation and DNS queries from Excel could indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server. However, without more context, like the exact domains being queried or additional indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to be certain. On the other hand, these actions could also be part of legitimate operations if the user is working with Excel in an environment that requires frequent network access.\n\nMy confidence level here isn't super high because there aren't enough details to definitively classify this as malicious. But the combination does raise some questions worth investigating. So, I'd lean towards classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" but not entirely sure.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes repeated file creation events and DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE, which may indicate unusual activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
