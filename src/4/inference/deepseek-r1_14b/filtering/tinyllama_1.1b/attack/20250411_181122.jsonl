{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal because whoami is a common tool used to display user information, often part of legitimate scripts or administrative tasks.\n\nNext, there are several events related to powershell.exe. The command line in some of these shows a script searching for files containing sensitive keywords like \"pass\" across various file types (xml, doc, txt, xls). This is a red flag because this kind of activity can be used by attackers to search for credentials or sensitive information. It's concerning that the script is trying to find password-related data.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is loading various .NET framework components and other DLLs. While PowerShell often loads these for legitimate operations, the combination with the file search script raises suspicion.\n\nThere are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe, which might indicate that it's being used in a loop or as part of a larger script execution. This could be part of an attempt to remain persistent on the system or carry out tasks over time.\n\nAnother event shows a file deletion: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". Deleting files can erase evidence, so this makes me think that perhaps malicious activity is being covered up. Alternatively, it might be part of a legitimate cleanup process, but combined with the other events, it's more concerning.\n\nThe \"Pipe Created\" event for powershell.exe suggests interprocess communication, which could be used to coordinate different processes or to hide malicious activities. This adds to the suspicion level.\n\nThere are also multiple registry writes from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome often modifies the registry for settings, the number of events (six instances) is notable. It's possible that an attacker is using legitimate tools like Powershell and Chrome for command execution or persistence, leveraging their built-in capabilities to avoid detection.\n\nThe Dns query event from chrome.exe might be part of normal browsing activity, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting all this together: the repeated use of powershell.exe with a script searching for sensitive data, file deletions, and multiple registry writes across different processes are indicators that could point to malicious activities. The batch shows a pattern of behavior that is not typical of normal user activity. While some events might be legitimate, the combination raises concerns about potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, I think this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation because it exhibits several red flags indicative of possible cyber threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe system log events in question are deemed interesting for cybersecurity investigation due to several concerning activities. Notably, powershell.exe is used to execute a script searching for sensitive data, potentially indicating malicious intent. Additionally, file deletions and multiple registry modifications across processes suggest possible unauthorized access or attempts at persistence. While some actions could be legitimate, the combination raises significant red flags warranting further scrutiny.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits concerning activities indicative of potential cyber threats. The use of powershell.exe for searching sensitive data, file deletions, and multiple registry modifications across processes are red flags suggesting possible malicious intent or unauthorized access. Therefore, this batch is interesting for cybersecurity investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"powershell_script_activity\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing a script that searches for sensitive data (e.g., files containing 'pass'), which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n    \"file_deletion\": \"A file deletion event suggests possible evidence erasure, adding to the suspicion of malicious intent.\",\n    \"registry_modifications\": \"Numerous registry writes by both chrome.exe and powershell.exe may indicate unauthorized system changes or persistence mechanisms.\",\n    \"interprocess_communication\": \"Pipe creation in powershell.exe could be used for coordinating malicious activities, enhancing concern.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe making registry changes and network connections. That might be normal since Chrome does update its settings, but the number of RegistryEvent tasks seems high—four in total. Not sure yet if that's malicious or just regular activity.\n\nThen there are several instances where winlogbeat.exe is creating files. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so it's expected to create files. However, the fact that it's creating .winlogbeat.yml.new files multiple times could be worth looking into—maybe a misconfiguration or file conflict?\n\nNext, I notice powershell.exe creating files like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused. Creating files with these names doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other events, it might need scrutiny.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process running with the command line pointing to system32. That seems normal unless there's something unusual in how it's being executed, like elevated privileges or unexpected parameters. Not seeing that here.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe processes deleting tasks via schtasks and wmic. Using WMIC to delete processes is a common technique for malware to suppress detection. The command line \"\/c schtasks \/delete\" suggests an attempt to remove scheduled tasks which could be hiding persistence mechanisms. Also, deleting notepad.exe processes might indicate covering tracks or preventing logging.\n\nLooking further, I see svchost.exe and conhost.exe making registry changes. These are standard system processes, but unusual RegistryEvent activity from them can be suspicious—maybe installing backdoors or modifying security settings.\n\nThe events involving schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll seem normal for scheduling operations, but paired with the deletion of scheduled tasks earlier, it might indicate an attempt to remove monitoring tools or disable system features.\n\nLastly, WMIC.exe is loading multiple DLLs. While this can be part of its functionality, combined with the previous deletions and other activities, it could be part of a larger malicious process chain—maybe downloading components or executing code remotely.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several red flags like deleting processes via cmd\/wmic, modifying registry entries from non-standard sources, multiple file creations by winlogbeat which might indicate log tampering. The use of schtasks and wmic for deletions is concerning as these can be used to remove monitoring tools or suppress logs. Additionally, the number of RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe stands out, possibly indicating unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because there are multiple potentially malicious activities that together suggest a coordinated effort to maintain presence on the system, which could indicate an active threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show suspicious activity including potential deletion of processes, registry modifications, and file creations by system-related executables. Notable events include multiple deletions via cmd.exe and WMIC.exe, RegistryEvent changes from non-standard sources, and file creation activities that may indicate malicious intent or misconfiguration.\",\n  \"SCORE\": \"High\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **WMIC.exe**: This process is known for legitimate use but can also be used maliciously for remote control. The log mentions an image loaded, which could mean it's starting up a module or service.\n   \n2. **cmd.exe** with command line deleting a user: This stands out because cmd.exe is commonly used for administrative tasks, and deleting users might indicate privilege changes. The fact that it's using \"\/del\" suggests deletion without confirmation, possibly trying to remove an admin account.\n\n3. **powershell.exe**: PowerShell is powerful but often abused by attackers. Accessing processes could be part of gathering info or lateral movement.\n\n4. Another powershell.exe with registry value set: Registry changes can be malicious, like adding persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\n5. cmd.exe deleting another user: Similar to the third event, this repetition of user deletions is concerning. Using \"\/del\" without confirmation might indicate automated or malicious scripts.\n\n6. Powershell again accessing process: Could be part of an attack chain, maybe trying to elevate privileges or hide traces.\n\n7. net.exe deleting a user: Another deletion attempt using a different command. This adds to the pattern of multiple user deletions.\n\n8. whoami.exe: Typically used for checking permissions, but in this context after other events, it might be part of an attack to gather credentials or test access levels.\n\n9. Security Group Management entries without process info: These could be legitimate admin tasks, but considering the other events, they might mask malicious activity.\n\n10. Powershell accessing again and modifying registry: More indicators of potential malicious activities, possibly setting up backdoors or persistence.\n\n11. cmd.exe with a long command line deleting another user: The command seems to delete a user named \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\", which is similar in naming convention to previous deletions.\n\n12. Powershell accessing processes multiple times: Reinforces the idea of an attack chain, maybe running malicious scripts or modules.\n\n13. sc.exe deleting a service (win32times): Deleting services can disrupt system functionality and might be part of removing traces or disabling monitoring tools.\n\n14. services.exe with registry change: Another point where registry modifications could be setting up persistence or changing service configurations.\n\n15. whoami.exe again: Possibly checking permissions after earlier deletions, which is a red flag.\n\n16. Powershell accessing processes, cmd.exe modifying registry, etc.: The repetition of these actions suggests a coordinated attack rather than random events.\n\n17. Multiple powershell.exe instances with \"& {}\": This looks suspicious because it's a common technique to obfuscate command lines, making detection harder. It could be part of a larger script or payload execution.\n\n18. Powershell image load and file access: Loading modules (mscoree.dll) might indicate execution of malicious scripts that require certain libraries, often used in attacks.\n\nPutting this all together, the events show multiple attempts to delete admin users using cmd.exe and net.exe, which is a clear indicator of potential privilege escalation or lateral movement. The extensive use of powershell.exe for process access and registry modifications suggests an attacker trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the network. Additionally, the obfuscated command lines in powershell.exe (\"& {}\") are a red flag for script-based attacks aimed at evading detection.\n\nThe fact that these events repeat with similar patterns indicates a deliberate campaign rather than accidental user actions. The combination of deleting users and modifying system configurations could lead to loss of control over accounts, data exfiltration, or installation of backdoors.\n\nTherefore, the batch is highly indicative of malicious activity, making it very interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The log contains multiple instances of potentially malicious activities including user deletions via cmd.exe and net.exe, extensive use of powershell.exe for process access and registry modifications, suspicious command lines with obfuscation, and image loading that may indicate malicious script execution. These patterns suggest a coordinated attack attempt involving privilege escalation and lateral movement.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let's look through each event.\n\nMost events involve powershell.exe loading various .NET framework files and accessing processes. These seem normal as PowerShell often loads these modules. There are a couple of Registry value sets by powershell.exe and other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, which can be routine administrative tasks or part of system operations. \n\nI notice two instances of whoami.exe being executed, but since it's a common command for checking user information, it doesn't raise red flags on its own. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is also typical.\n\nThere are some events from winlogbeat.exe creating files, which suggests log management activity. The chrome.exe entries show DNS queries and network connections, which are usual behaviors for a web browser accessing the internet.\n\nThe only potential concern might be multiple process accesses by powershell.exe, but without evidence of malicious commands or suspicious file operations, it's hard to see any foul play here. All activities appear within normal operational parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes such as PowerShell loading standard .NET libraries and common tools like whoami.exe and Calculator.exe being executed.
