Each event is in JSONL format with some fields related to processes and Windows logs.\n\nFirst, most of the events have null for the process name, but tasks like SystemStart, VsmPolicyEnablement, DirtyBootShutdown, BootMenuPolicy, BootType, and Process Creation are mentioned. These seem like normal system startup and boot-related activities. Then there's an event where smss.exe is created, which I know is a legitimate Windows process related to Session Manager Subsystem, so that's not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks: DirtyTransition, Other Policy Change Events... these could be part of normal system operations or policies being applied during startup. Since all the events seem to revolve around standard system processes and no indicators like unexpected user activity, failed login attempts, or access to restricted areas are present, there's nothing here that raises a red flag.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior, so I'd classify this batch as not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system startup and process creation activities without any indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
