{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events show powershell.exe being executed with command lines that reference scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. These scripts are typically used for keylogging or other malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The script paths point to locations on the system, which might be storing logs of keystrokes in the TEMP directory.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs and creating files, including some temporary files. For example, creating files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 could indicate that Powershell is trying to bypass certain policies or test execution contexts, which is suspicious.\n\nThere's also an event where a remote command is executed, referencing another Get-Keystrokes script. This suggests potential remote control or command execution, which is concerning as it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nI notice some legitimate activities too, like winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files and svchost.exe creating state files. These might not be malicious but are present alongside the suspicious powershell activity, so they don't necessarily negate the risk.\n\nThe combination of multiple Powershell executions with potentially malicious scripts, temporary file creations, and remote command execution makes this batch stand out as concerning. There's a pattern suggesting unauthorized data collection or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) aimed at capturing keystrokes, along with suspicious file creation and deletion activities in the TEMP directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
