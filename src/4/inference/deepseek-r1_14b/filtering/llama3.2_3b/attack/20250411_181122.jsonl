{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command line arguments look suspicious: \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password\". This seems like a script searching for files with certain extensions containing the word 'pass' or 'password'. That's a red flag because attackers often search for sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessing various files. The process is creating temporary PowerShell scripts (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1) which are then deleted shortly after. This behavior could indicate an attempt to execute code without leaving a trace, which is common in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the script is using findstr and select-string commands to search for patterns related to passwords. This kind of activity isn't typical unless someone is trying to harvest credentials or sensitive data. The repeated creation and deletion might be part of a larger malicious process, perhaps to avoid detection by security tools.\n\nOther events show powershell.exe loading various system files, which can be normal but combined with the command line details makes it suspicious. There's also an instance where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll, which is less concerning on its own but could be part of a broader activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows potentially malicious behavior involving PowerShell scripts searching for sensitive information and creating\/deleting temporary files. This combination increases the likelihood that something nefarious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines searching for 'password' patterns in various file types, coupled with temporary script creation and deletion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of processes being created and executed. There are several entries for cmd.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, WMIC.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. The command lines often involve deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" or \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin.\" This suggests that someone is attempting to remove user accounts from the system.\n\nLooking deeper, I see commands such as \"\/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete,\" which tries to terminate Notepad processes. Additionally, there are attempts to delete users using net.exe and net1.exe with parameters like \"\/del\" and \"\/domain.\" These actions indicate a potential attempt to clean up traces of other user accounts, possibly to cover tracks or remove unauthorized access points.\n\nThe use of multiple command-line tools like cmd.exe, WMIC, and PowerShell is common in scripting for malicious activities. The repeated attempts to delete users across different commands make me think this isn't just accidental; it shows a deliberate effort to modify system accounts.\n\nI also notice registry value sets and image loads, which could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations to allow unauthorized access. For example, schtasks.exe is often used for scheduling tasks, and seeing it load taskschd.dll might be related to task creation or modification.\n\nConsidering the overall pattern, these events don't look like normal user activity. They exhibit signs of potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior, such as account deletion attempts, process termination, and use of multiple tools typically associated with scripting attacks. While some events could be legitimate system administration tasks, the volume and nature of these actions raise red flags.\n\nHowever, without more context about the environment and user permissions, it's hard to be certain if this is an actual breach or just misconfigured scripts. But given the combination of process creations, account deletions, and use of multiple tools, I'm leaning towards this being suspicious.\n\nSo, after analyzing all these events together, they seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletion attempts and process terminations using various command-line tools suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is a file creation by PowerShell in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit suspicious because scripts here can run at startup without user interaction. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command using findstr and select-string with 'password' as a pattern. This looks like it could be searching for sensitive information, which is definitely red flag territory.\n\nThen there are multiple Chrome events related to DNS queries, registry changes, image loads, and network connections. While these aren't inherently malicious, too many of them in a short period might indicate some unusual activity, maybe malicious scripts or extensions.\n\nI notice several instances where files are being created by winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent used for log management. This doesn't seem suspicious on its own unless it's accessing restricted areas or behaving abnormally, which I don't see here.\n\nThere are a couple more PowerShell file creations, and one of them is 'objeto_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder. That could be part of data exfiltration if that file contains sensitive info.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process creation. While this can be used to check user permissions, it's often used by attackers to gather information about system accounts.\n\nThen I see cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks. This caught my attention because deleting tasks without proper authorization could indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or disrupt system operations.\n\nSimilarly, there are multiple schtasks.exe process creations and deletions of specific task names like 'unidade_geral_005_OnLogon' and others. These actions suggest someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks, possibly to cover their tracks or prevent certain actions from running.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell commands searching for passwords, file creations by potentially malicious scripts, use of whoami.exe, and multiple deletions of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe indicates possible malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain—reconnaissance, credential harvesting, persistence removal, etc.\n\nWhile some events individually might not look suspicious, the overall pattern suggests a coordinated effort that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially malicious activities such as password searching via PowerShell, deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe and cmd.exe, which may indicate an attack or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: cmd.exe is running with an empty command line. It's a registry value being set. Not sure yet, but cmd.exe is common for scripts.\n\nSecond event: sc.exe deleting win32times service. That's legitimate admin activity; services are often managed that way.\n\nThird event: services.exe setting another registry value. Services.exe is part of Windows, so this seems normal.\n\nFourth: whoami.exe being run without arguments. Just a user info check, nothing malicious here.\n\nFifth: powershell.exe running with an empty command line. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things, but alone it's not suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nSixth event: cmd.exe deleting some temp files with specific names ending in .exe. That catches my eye because deleting temporary files, especially executable ones, might indicate cleanup after malicious activity. The command is using del with these files and redirecting output to nul, which is common for hiding actions.\n\nSeventh event: cmd.exe again, but this time it's deleting a specific file path. It’s the same user as before (fiddelis), so maybe they're doing some cleanup or removing temporary files from an application. But the fact that it's two cmd events with deletions might be worth noting.\n\nEighth to eleventh: conhost.exe and powershell.exe accessing registry, image loads, etc. Conhost is a Windows process host, often used by PowerShell. The repeated provider lifecycle events in the logs could indicate script execution or module loading, which is standard for PowerShell scripts.\n\nTwelfth event: cmd.exe with an unusual command line. It's using %temp% variables and deleting files like tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe and estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe. These names look suspicious because they imply that a malicious script was decoding some payload into these files, which were then deleted to cover tracks.\n\nLooking further down: there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. Some of them involve deleting specific files in the temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. This seems like part of a script execution process, possibly testing for policy compliance, but combined with other deletions, it's concerning.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe and calc.exe events are normal system processes accessing resources, so probably not relevant.\n\nPutting this together: There are multiple instances where cmd.exe is deleting temporary files, especially .exe files. This could indicate that a malicious script was run, created these files as part of its payload, and then tried to delete evidence after execution. The use of specific filenames (like _calc) suggests they're related to each other.\n\nPowerShell is involved multiple times, which is often used in attacks for scripting and executing commands. While PowerShell itself isn't malicious, the combination of it with these file deletions raises suspicion. Also, the repeated attempts to delete files could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nSo overall, this batch shows a series of actions that look like they might be cleaning up after some malicious process, possibly involving the deletion of temporary files created during an attack. The multiple deletions and use of PowerShell suggest potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show cmd.exe deleting temp files with suspicious names, indicating possible cleanup after malicious activity. PowerShell usage combined with these deletions suggests potential attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that Calculator.exe loaded an image. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application, and it might load necessary libraries when it runs. The file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which sounds legitimate since urlmon is a known DLL used for URL handling in Windows.\n\nNext up, winlogbeat.exe created a new file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool related to log management, so it's normal for it to create configuration files like .winlogbeat.yml.new. This doesn't raise any red flags as part of its standard operation.\n\nThe third event has powershell.exe accessing something via a rule called ProcessAccess. Powershell can do a lot, both legitimate and malicious. Without more context, this could be suspicious because attackers often use Powershell for lateral movement or executing commands. However, it's also commonly used by admins for system tasks, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe fourth event is whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to its standard path. Whoami is a basic system utility that shows user information, so seeing it run alone isn't concerning. It's typically used to check permissions or debug issues.\n\nThen there are three events from chrome.exe: two DNS queries and one network connection. Browsers do this all the time as part of normal operation—resolving domain names and connecting to websites. There’s nothing unusual here unless the URLs are suspicious, but they aren't specified in these logs.\n\nPutting it all together, most events seem routine. The only potentially concerning point is the powershell.exe activity because of its versatility in both legitimate and malicious contexts. However, without evidence of other malicious behavior or suspicious commands, I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as loading DLLs, creating log files, and standard network\/DNS operations. There's no indication of malicious behavior or unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
