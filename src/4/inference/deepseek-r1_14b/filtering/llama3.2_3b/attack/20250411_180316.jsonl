{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this batch of system log events is worth investigating. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from processes like powershell.exe being accessed or created. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it appears several times with different command lines might indicate something suspicious, especially if the commands aren't clearly benign.\n\nLooking further, I notice cmd.exe being used in various ways. One event shows a command-line argument that deletes a process named notepad.exe. While deleting processes can be legitimate, the way it's executed here—using wmic and a delete command—might be a sign of trying to hide activity or remove evidence.\n\nThere are also instances where system files are being copied or modified. For example, copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe stands out. This is concerning because sethc.exe is part of Windows System Restore, and replacing it can disrupt system integrity. Malware might do this to prevent recovery or maintain persistence.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of schtasks.exe to delete a task. Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers to maintain persistence across reboots. Deleting such tasks could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nFurthermore, processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and conhost.exe are involved in some events. While these are standard Windows processes, their activities alongside other suspicious behaviors might warrant closer examination.\n\nThe repeated use of whoami.exe is also notable. This tool is often used to gather system information, which attackers might do to escalate privileges or understand the environment better.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions, cmd commands that delete processes and system files, manipulation of scheduled tasks, and usage of tools like whoami.exe suggests potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain aiming to gain access, maintain persistence, or cover tracks. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as repeated PowerShell executions, cmd commands deleting processes and system files, manipulation of scheduled tasks, and usage of tools like whoami.exe, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that each line is a JSON object representing an event. The events involve processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with various tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Process Create', 'Image loaded', etc. \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n- There's a process named powershell.exe setting a registry value.\n- Then cmd.exe is created with a command line that looks suspicious because it's \"\/c\" which usually runs a command and exits, but the argument isn't clear here.\n- Another cmd.exe sets a registry value again.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is involved in multiple events. It's known for being both legitimate and often abused by attackers due to its scripting capabilities. The fact that it's loading various .dll files might be normal, but sometimes adversaries inject malicious code into these processes.\n\nThere are several 'File created' tasks, which could indicate script creation or temporary file storage—something a bad actor might do to execute malicious scripts without leaving a long trace.\n\nThe command lines in some powershell.exe events have complex paths and conditions. For example: \n- {if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}} \nThis looks like a script check; if the specified path exists, it does nothing (exits successfully), else exits with an error. This could be part of a stager or a way to ensure certain conditions before executing malicious code.\n\nAnother point is that some processes are created with command lines that reference .bat files. Since powershell can execute batch scripts, this might be a way to run arbitrary commands, which could be malicious.\n\nThe events also show 'Pipe Created' and multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks under powershell.exe, which suggests inter-process communication or possibly remote command execution.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe with varying command lines.\n- Registry modifications that could indicate persistence or configuration changes.\n- Creation of files in temporary directories (like AppData\\Local\\Temp).\n- Complex conditional checks in scripts that might be attempting to validate presence of other files before proceeding.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch shows behaviors consistent with potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments and file operations could indicate scripting or process injection attempts. While some activities are normal (like legitimate script execution), the combination raises red flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell Instances**: The frequent use of powershell.exe, especially with complex command-line arguments, is notable. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities due to its powerful execution capabilities.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Several events involve setting registry values. While legitimate software can modify the registry, attackers often use this technique for persistence or configuration changes.\n\n3. **File Creation in Temporary Directories**: The creation of files in locations like AppData\\Local\\Temp suggests possible storage of temporary malicious scripts, which could be part of an attack strategy to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Conditional Script Execution**: The command-line arguments containing conditional checks (e.g., exiting based on file presence) may indicate a stager waiting for specific conditions before executing further commands.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation and Provider Lifecycle Events**: These events suggest inter-process communication, which could be used for remote command execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities—use of powershell.exe with complex scripts, registry modifications, temporary file creation, and conditional checks—raises significant red flags. These behaviors are consistent with potential malicious intent, such as script execution or process injection. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these processes and ensure system security.\n\n**Answer**: The batch is considered interesting due to indicators suggestive of potential malicious activity, including powershell.exe usage patterns, registry modifications, file creation in temporary directories, and conditional scripting behaviors."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events, all related to PowerShell and Chrome activities. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events are from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because while PowerShell is a legitimate tool for system administration, it's often used in cyberattacks due to its scripting capabilities. The events show various tasks like image loading, file creation, and registry changes, which can be part of normal operations but could also signal malicious activity.\n\nLooking closer, there are multiple instances where files are being created and deleted. For example, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. That seems suspicious because creating a file just to delete it might be a way to test if certain policies are enforced or to erase evidence.\n\nThe command lines in some events show that PowerShell is executing scripts that create batch files in different directories. The paths like C:\\modulo_ativo, C:\\estrutura_auxiliar, and others seem arbitrary but could be part of an attempt to spread malicious files across the system. The fact that these scripts are being created suggests potential payload delivery.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity involving registry changes. While PowerShell can manage registry settings for legitimate purposes, frequent modifications without clear reason might indicate tampering with system configurations, which is often seen in malware aiming to persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'New-Item' and 'Set-Content' commands. These are common in script-based attacks to create new files or modify existing ones. The values being set (like \"dir\") might seem benign, but in the context of these multiple events, it could be part of a larger script that's setting up components across different directories.\n\nThe involvement of Chrome.exe with registry modifications is also interesting. While browsers do interact with the registry for settings, unexpected changes here could indicate some form of persistence mechanism or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, this sequence of events resembles typical indicators of a potential malicious payload deployment. The pattern of file creation and deletion, coupled with script execution across various directories and registry modifications, raises concerns about unauthorized system access or an attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Process:** All events are related to `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe`, which are legitimate tools but can be misused.\n\n2. **Analyze Event Types:** Majority involve file creation\/deletion, image loading, registry changes, and script execution—common in both legitimate scripts and malware.\n\n3. **File Activity:** Creation and deletion of temporary script files (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1) may indicate testing or hiding malicious activities.\n\n4. **Script Execution:** Powershell commands create and modify batch files across various directories, suggesting potential payload distribution.\n\n5. **Registry Modifications:** Frequent registry changes could be for persistence or privilege escalation, common in malware.\n\n6. **Command-Line Analysis:** Use of `New-Item` and `Set-Content` indicates scripting activities that might be malicious, especially with repeated arbitrary directory accesses.\n\n7. **Chrome Activity:** Registry modifications by Chrome may hint at browser-related attacks or data theft.\n\n8. **Pattern Recognition:** The sequence shows a potential attack lifecycle—initial intrusion, lateral movement, payload deployment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observed activity exhibits several red flags indicative of malicious behavior, including suspicious file operations, script execution across directories, and registry modifications. These actions align with common tactics used in cyberattacks, suggesting a potential security threat that warrants further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are related to PowerShell activities on the system. I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve creating new files and setting content in batch scripts. For example, there are several entries like \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\" which indicate file creation and modification.\n\nThe tasks logged include things like \"File created\", \"Image loaded\", and \"Registry value set\". These seem normal for PowerShell as it's a common tool used both for legitimate scripting and malicious activities. \n\nI notice that some of the command lines are creating batch files in various directories, such as \"entrada_base\" and \"modulo_comum\". This could be part of setting up scripts to run later or to modify system configurations.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was deleted: \"File Delete logged\", which might suggest some cleanup activity after initial script execution. However, without more context on what exactly is being deleted, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of different paths and structures in the command lines. The paths like \"C:\\\\modulo_base\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\" seem structured but could be attempting to place files in locations that are not typically monitored or accessed often, which might be a way to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the variety of tasks: file creation, image loading, registry changes, and process access. These activities alone don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior since they're common for legitimate scripts too. However, the combination of creating multiple files in different locations and checking if certain files exist (as seen in some command lines with \"Test-Path\") could be part of a script that's trying to establish persistence or ensure it runs without interference.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that these events are part of a larger campaign. The repeated use of PowerShell, which is often used by attackers due to its built-in capabilities and the difficulty in detecting malicious scripts within it, raises some flags. Additionally, the creation of batch files could be a way to execute other commands later, potentially leading to further actions on the system.\n\nBut without knowing the exact nature of these scripts or seeing any signs of overtly malicious behavior like privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or known exploit usage, it's hard to definitively label this as an attack. It could still be legitimate administrative activity or part of a script for system maintenance.\n\nIn summary, while the activities are concerning due to the use of PowerShell and file creation\/deletion patterns, they don't provide enough evidence on their own to conclude malicious intent. However, they do warrant closer monitoring, especially if these events occur in conjunction with other unusual behaviors or if the scripts are found to contain malicious code.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of cybersecurity events is deemed **interesting** but not definitively malicious. The activities involve PowerShell executing commands that create and modify files, which could indicate potential malicious behavior such as establishing persistence or script execution. While there's no conclusive evidence of an attack, the use of PowerShell and file operations merits further investigation to ensure these actions are legitimate and not part of a larger campaign."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of events here that I need to analyze. They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to look at the entire batch and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe created a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That seems normal because PowerShell does create profile data when it starts, especially non-interactively. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nNext, there's another event where powershell.exe accessed something related to process access. Again, this is standard as processes often access other processes or files without anything malicious necessarily happening.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe running. Whoami is a legitimate system tool that displays user information, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple PowerShell events with command lines that check for the existence of certain .exe files and exit based on whether they find them or not. This kind of scripting can be part of legitimate operations, like checks during deployment or scripts verifying prerequisites. It's also a common tactic in malware to check if it has already been deployed or if certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nThere are several instances where powershell.exe is loading different DLLs and modules. PowerShell often loads various libraries when running scripts, especially those related to .NET framework components, which isn't unusual.\n\nI notice one event where a file was deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. The deletion of temporary files is normal, especially if they are part of script execution and cleanup processes. However, sometimes attackers might delete logs or evidence, but in this case, it's a PowerShell-specific file related to scripting policies, which could be either legitimate or part of malicious activity trying to bypass restrictions.\n\nAnother event involves cmd.exe being used with a command that checks for the existence of a file and exits accordingly. Again, this is a common technique used in both benign scripts and malware for various purposes, including checking if certain conditions are met before executing more substantial commands.\n\nThere's also repeated access to processes by powershell.exe, which could be part of legitimate scripting or indicate reconnaissance activities where an attacker is checking system information.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions with checks on file existence, process accesses, loading various modules, and deletions. While some behaviors could be indicative of malicious activity, others are entirely normal. However, the repetitive nature of certain actions, especially using whoami.exe and cmd.exe in combination with powershell.exe, might raise concerns about potential script execution or lateral movement.\n\nBut considering that none of the events directly point to clear indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes, unusual process injection, or network communication), it's hard to say definitively without more context. It could be a legitimate script running checks, or it could be part of an attack chain. Given that there are no obvious red flags but some behaviors that are commonly used in both benign and malicious contexts, the batch is somewhat on the edge.\n\nTherefore, I would lean towards considering this batch as potentially interesting for further investigation because while individual events might not be suspicious, the combination could indicate something more concerning.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal and potentially concerning activities. While many actions are typical for legitimate processes, others align with common malicious tactics, albeit without clear indicators of compromise.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Legitimate Activities:** Use of whoami.exe, PowerShell profile creation, and DLL loading are standard.\n- **Potentially Suspicious Actions:** Multiple file existence checks, process accesses, deletions of temporary files, and the use of cmd.exe with conditional commands could indicate either benign scripting or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe batch is considered interesting for further investigation due to the combination of actions that, while not definitive, suggest possible malicious behavior. Further analysis would be necessary to determine the nature of these activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe with some command lines that seem to check for specific file paths and exit based on their existence. This behavior could be an attempt to verify if certain files are present, which might indicate malicious activity like checking for known vulnerability exploits or dropping additional payloads.\n\nAlso, there's a pattern where PowerShell creates temporary files in the user's AppData directory, then immediately deletes them. Such quick creation and deletion can be a sign of trying to avoid detection, commonly used by malware to clean up traces of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, the events show multiple ImageLoad tasks for various DLLs related to Windows Defender. While Defender is legitimate, frequent loading of these modules could suggest that an attacker is attempting to bypass or interfere with antivirus processes.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the repeated PowerShell executions with conditional logic, file operations in temporary directories, and interaction with system defender components—it's highly indicative of potential malicious behavior. This combination increases the overall risk level, making the batch definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes checking for file existence, creating temporary files, and interacting with system defender components, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a bunch of system log events here, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being run with some command lines that involve checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example, one event has the command line: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\tarefa_geral\\\\unidade_logico\\\\tarefa_logico\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". That looks suspicious because it's using powershell to check if a particular script exists. The script in question is Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds like it could be related to keylogging or capturing keystrokes, something malicious.\n\nI also notice that there are several such events checking different paths for the same script name. This repetition makes me think that maybe an attacker is trying multiple locations to see where their malicious script is stored. If they're checking multiple places, it might indicate they're trying to ensure persistence or check if their tool is present, which could be a sign of ongoing malicious activity.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is being created and accessed multiple times. Processes creating other processes can sometimes be indicators of command-line attacks or script execution. The fact that the same process is being created repeatedly raises an eyebrow—maybe it's part of a loop or some automated process, but in the context of cybersecurity, repeated process creations could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nLooking at the file events, there are instances where files are being loaded by powershell.exe, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are legitimate .NET framework components, so that's not immediately suspicious. However, powershell is known for loading various modules, some of which could be malicious if they're part of a script.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is being created in the Temp directory: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\". Temporary files created by scripts can sometimes be used to store malicious content temporarily before execution or deletion. This could be part of an attempt to bypass certain security policies by using a script that operates within the allowed policy, but creates a temporary file during its execution.\n\nAdditionally, I see whoami.exe being run a couple of times. While whoami is a legitimate tool to check user information, in some attack scenarios, it's used as part of lateral movement or privilege escalation. However, on its own, it's not necessarily suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern of activity.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with commands checking for malicious scripts across different paths, repeated process creations, and the creation of temporary script files in the Temp directory. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity, such as attempts to execute or check for the presence of keylogging or other malicious scripts. The repetition and varied file paths indicate a possible attempt to ensure the script is present or to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, these events are likely indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are detected in the logs. Powershell is often used by attackers for script execution and can be a vector for malicious activities.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The command lines show checks using `Test-Path` for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across various paths. This script's name suggests it may have keylogging capabilities, which is concerning.\n\n3. **Check for Repetitive Behavior:**\n   - The repeated creation and access of `powershell.exe` instances could indicate an attempt to execute a script multiple times or check its presence in different locations.\n\n4. **Examine File Operations:**\n   - A temporary file named `_PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` is created in the Temp directory. Temporary script files can be used to store malicious content temporarily, which might indicate an attempt to bypass security policies.\n\n5. **Consider Legitimate vs. Malicious Use:**\n   - While some file operations (like loading .NET modules) are normal, they occur within the context of potentially suspicious powershell activity.\n\n6. **Assess Overall Pattern:**\n   - The combination of checking for malicious scripts, repeated process creations, and temporary file creation suggests a pattern consistent with attack behavior, such as attempting to execute or ensure persistence of a keylogging script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe observed activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior, likely related to script execution and persistence attempts using powershell. These events should be investigated further for signs of compromise or attack."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe and mentions a network connection. That's normal since svchost is a system process. The second is chrome.exe doing the same, which is also standard. Then there are several entries with powershell.exe showing various activities: accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, creating pipes, and more.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe being called with a command line that includes ls -recurse and get-childitem, which are cmdlet commands often used for directory traversal. This could be part of legitimate scripting but might also indicate reconnaissance or data gathering, especially when combined with multiple registry modifications.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. Creating files in user directories can be suspicious if it's unexpected. The last event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which isn't concerning on its own.\n\nPutting this together: multiple powershell.exe events with network connections, directory listings, registry changes, and file creation could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.
