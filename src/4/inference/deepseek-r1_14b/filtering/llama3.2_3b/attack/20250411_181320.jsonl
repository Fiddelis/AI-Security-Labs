{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts, which might be malicious. The command lines show commands like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse,\" which are legitimate directory listing commands but when chained together, could indicate script execution or file searching in a way that seems unusual.\n\nLooking deeper, there are events where powershell.exe creates temporary files, specifically '__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1'. Creating and then deleting such files quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection or to test script policies without leaving traces for long. The file creation and deletion within the same process (same command line) could be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading .NET framework components. While this is normal for Powershell scripts that use .NET libraries, the combination with other behaviors might raise suspicion, especially if these activities happen outside of usual user behavior patterns.\n\nThere's also an event where a process accessed the registry (RegistryEvent). Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes made by malware. The fact that svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are involved in registry events could indicate they're being used for malicious purposes, as these legitimate system processes might be hijacked.\n\nFurthermore, there's a special logon event without any associated process. This might suggest an unusual authentication attempt, possibly from an unauthorized user or a compromised account.\n\nTaking all these points together, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity: suspicious Powershell script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications by non-standard processes, and unusual logon events. These factors collectively make the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple indicators suggest potential malicious activity involving PowerShell script execution, including suspicious file operations and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event involves powershell.exe accessing a process with the task labeled as ProcessAccess. Powershell is often used in scripting and can be associated with both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Since it's a common tool for attackers, this event catches my attention. I should note that any PowerShell activity might warrant closer inspection, especially if it's paired with other suspicious actions.\n\nNext up is calc.exe loading an image. This seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application. However, the file path points to urlmon.dll in the System32 directory. While this DLL is legitimate, sometimes malicious actors can misuse legitimate processes by injecting code or altering their behavior. It's worth keeping an eye on, especially if combined with other events.\n\nThe third event is svchost.exe modifying a registry value. SvcHost is part of Windows services and typically runs legitimate system processes. However, it's known to be used by malware for hiding and persistence. The combination of svchost.exe and a RegistryEvent could indicate malicious activity, as attackers often use the registry for persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe fourth event again involves Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, mirroring the second event. This repetition might suggest a pattern or possibly an attempt to hide malicious behavior under legitimate processes. It's notable because both instances of Calculator are accessing the same DLL file, which could be part of a broader attack vector.\n\nPutting it all together, I see multiple red flags: PowerShell execution, Registry modifications by svchost.exe, and repeated attempts by Calculator and calc.exe to access urlmon.dll. These actions don't seem normal when considered collectively. While individually they might not be suspicious, the combination points towards potential malicious behavior or at least unusual system activity that needs closer examination.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the cumulative effect of these events suggests possible unauthorized access or malicious intent. My confidence is high enough to mark it as interesting, but I'm not certain without further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving potentially suspicious activities such as PowerShell execution and registry modifications, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
