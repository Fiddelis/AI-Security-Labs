{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with process info, winlog task, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple PowerShell processes. That's common for admins to use, but sometimes attackers do too. The command lines in the events show that they're running various commands. One thing that stands out is the use of \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\", which can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers to prevent script blocks from being blocked.\n\nLooking at the specific PowerShell commands: one writes \"Final result: 1\" and another checks for certain .inf files related to Dism features. That seems unusual. The fact that they're checking for patterns in .inf files might indicate they're trying to gather information or disable something, possibly Windows Defender as seen later.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe command that runs Dism with parameters to disable the Windows Defender feature and remove it without restarting. Disabling Defender could be an attempt to lower system security, which is a concerning sign of potential malicious activity.\n\nThe events where files are created in the Temp folder, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1\", might indicate that scripts are being tested or dropped there. Temporary script files can be part of attacks to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, multiple ImageLoad and PipeCreated events suggest PowerShell is loading modules and creating pipes, which could be for communication with other processes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the combination of using PowerShell with restricted execution policies, attempting to disable Defender, checking specific system files, and creating temporary scripts points towards possible malicious activity. This batch definitely needs a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands that attempt to disable Windows Defender and check for specific .inf file patterns, along with the creation of temporary script files, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by understanding each event.\n\nEach JSON object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key always shows 'Dism.exe', which I recognize as the Deployment Image Service Manager, a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing Windows images. That makes me think it's part of normal system operations.\n\nThe winlog field in each event indicates that a file executable was detected, triggered by the rule FileExecutableDetected. This suggests that Dism.exe is accessing or executing files, which seems routine since Dism handles various system files during deployment or servicing tasks.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with unique GUID-like folder names. The files being accessed are DLLs and MUI (multi-language) files, such as 'DismHost.exe', various .dll, and .mui files. These seem like legitimate components that Dism.exe would interact with during its operations.\n\nI also notice that all these events share the same process name and similar file paths. This consistency makes me think it's a standard operation rather than something malicious, which might show more varied or irregular behavior across different processes.\n\nConsidering that Dism.exe is a known Microsoft tool, unless there's an unusual spike in activity or attempts to access unexpected files, these events don't raise red flags. The fact that they're all FileExecutableDetected events without any additional indicators of compromise (like writes to unexpected locations or network traffic) supports the idea that this is normal.\n\nIn summary, each event seems to be part of a legitimate process by Dism.exe accessing necessary files in temporary directories. Without signs of anomalies or deviations from expected behavior, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve the legitimate Windows tool Dism.exe accessing standard system files during its normal operations. The consistent file paths and types accessed do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst event is powershell.exe running some commands that seem like creating a new service and starting it. The command line looks suspicious with the service name \"objeto_ativo\" which doesn't look standard, and the binary path pointing to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path is a bit long and seems out of place.\n\nNext couple of events are powershell.exe loading some .NET framework DLLs. Those could be normal if it's part of script execution, but I should note them.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for a PowerShell script in the user's Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. That looks like a temporary script which might not be unusual, but when combined with other events, it could indicate something.\n\nAfter that, the same script is deleted right after creation. So it was created and then removed—maybe to avoid detection? Or perhaps part of legitimate cleanup.\n\nThere are several registry value sets by services.exe and svchost.exe. Those can be tricky because many processes interact with the registry, but repeated writes might be a sign of malicious activity like installing a service or creating persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there's a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" created via powershell, which was started right after. Services are common for persistent malware because they start on boot.\n\nLooking at other events: setup.exe is creating some Edge-related files. That seems normal unless it's modifying files outside its usual scope or there are multiple writes to unexpected locations.\n\nThe file creations by setup.exe don't seem suspicious on their own, but considering the overall activity—powershell.exe running elevated commands, script creation\/deletion, and service modifications—I should be concerned.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows powershell.exe performing several actions that could be indicators of malicious behavior. The script execution, temporary file handling, and registry changes, along with creating a new service, are red flags. This might suggest command-line abuse or potential malware installation.\n\nSo, I think this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation because it combines multiple elements that can indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including script execution, file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event is from setup.exe creating a file in the EdgeCore directory. That seems normal for an installer. The next few events are also setup.exe creating files related to Edge, which aligns with typical software installation processes.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe performing multiple registry operations. SvcHost is known for hosting system services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. However, seeing several entries from the same process doing similar tasks might warrant a closer look but not necessarily raise red flags yet.\n\nI notice that setup.exe also does some registry writes and creates pipes. Pipes can be part of inter-process communication, which could be normal during setup processes. It's important to check if these actions are within expected bounds for legitimate software installations.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple file creation events by svchost.exe in the Windows Temp directory with temporary names ending in .tmp. These might be related to application updates or installations extracting files temporarily, which is common behavior. However, the specific paths and filenames should be checked against known patterns to ensure they're not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nThe last few entries are from RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe creating a file path that includes \"AppReadiness.\" This could be related to app deployment or configuration, but it's another area where context is needed. Without more details on what these processes are doing exactly, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to involve common activities during software installations and system service operations. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior like unusual file paths, unexpected writes to sensitive areas, or signs of privilege escalation. However, the volume of registry changes and temporary files could hint at something more than standard activity, but without additional context, it's hard to classify them as definitely suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while individually these actions might be normal, the combination could indicate an ongoing installation or update process that might merit closer monitoring. The confidence isn't too high, maybe around 0.6, since there are potential explanations that aren't malicious, but some red flags like multiple registry writes and temp files could point to investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by setup.exe and svchost.exe in temporary directories and system locations, along with extensive registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized software installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me see what each event looks like and try to understand the context.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have the same structure: a process named DismHost.exe loading images from different .dll files in a temporary directory. The file paths are consistent across these events, just changing the filename part. Then, towards the end, there are two more events where Dism.exe is deleting files in the same temp directory.\n\nHmm, I remember that DismHost.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used for servicing and deployment operations. So, it makes sense that this process would be loading various DLLs during its operation. The fact that multiple image loads are happening seems normal for such a system process.\n\nThe last two events show file deletions by Dism.exe. Again, in the context of deployment or servicing, cleaning up temporary files after a task completes is expected behavior. It doesn't raise any red flags because legitimate software often deletes temporary files it creates to free up space and ensure security.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, strange processes, or unexpected file operations outside the norm for Dism-related activities. All events are happening in a temp directory, which is a common place for system processes to store temporary files.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the batch shows normal operations related to Windows deployment tools loading and cleaning up DLLs. There's no indication of malicious activity or anything unusual that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operation of DismHost.exe loading image files and subsequent deletion by Dism.exe, which is expected behavior related to Windows deployment services.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, and there are multiple events here. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them involve processes named 'Dism.exe' and later on, 'DismHost.exe'. The tasks mentioned are \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Process Create\", along with some image loads.\n\nIn the first 12 events, each one has a process named 'Dism.exe' executing and detecting file executables. All these files seem to be DLLs (like .mui, .dll) located in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific GUID-like folder name.\n\nThen there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' is created, followed by some image loads of the same exe and another .dll. \n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to Windows deployment services and is used for image servicing. It's part of the operating system and runs during setup or updates. The temporary files mentioned in the path (like en-US language pack providers) are typical when an OS is setting up or customizing the environment.\n\nThe detection of these executables could be normal during such operations, especially if a new language pack or update is being applied. Since all events point to legitimate system processes related to deployment and setup, there's no indication of malicious activity here.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any signs of suspicious behavior in this batch. The activities are consistent with standard Windows operations, so it's not something that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events relate to legitimate system processes (Dism.exe and DismHost.exe) handling temporary files during deployment or setup.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, looking at each JSON object, I see that the process name is always Dism.exe and the task is a file deletion logged under FileDeleteDetected rule. The files being deleted are all in a temporary directory path, with various .dll.mui and .dll extensions.\n\nHmm, first thought: Dism.exe is related to Windows deployment services, used for installing and configuring Windows. It's a legitimate system process, so that's normal. Now, the events are about file deletions—so why would this be suspicious? Well, multiple file deletes from the same user account in the same temp directory might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking closer at the files: they all have similar naming conventions and are located under a temporary folder. This looks like maybe Dism.exe is cleaning up after itself during some deployment or imaging task. The fact that there are 14 events all involving deletions by the same process suggests it's part of a routine cleanup.\n\nBut wait, could this indicate something malicious? Sometimes attackers might delete logs to cover their tracks, but in this case, all files are DLLs and providers related to Windows deployment, which doesn't seem like sensitive data. Plus, Dism.exe is known for such operations during system setup or updates.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of logspamming—maybe an attacker is creating a lot of events to obscure real activity. But given that it's all from the same process and similar files, it seems more like legitimate behavior.\n\nSo, putting it together: multiple file deletions by Dism.exe in a temp directory likely part of normal system operations during deployment or setup. No signs of malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file deletion activity by the Dism.exe process, which is associated with Windows deployment and configuration tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. The user provided a batch of JSONL events and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one. \n\nThe first event has a process with the command line invoking powershell.exe with some arguments. Powershell can be tricky because it's often used for legitimate tasks but also abused for malicious activities. The script seems to check for specific .inf files and look for patterns in them. This could be part of a system configuration change, but I'm cautious because certain scripts might be trying to hide or alter system settings, which could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThe second event is about Security Group Management under the task category. That sounds pretty standard; groups being managed isn't unusual unless there's an anomaly in permissions or access changes.\n\nThird, a Special Logon event. This usually relates to user logon activity, maybe related to service accounts or system processes logging in. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting them together: The first event stands out because of the powershell command and the specific file checks. The other two are more generic. If I were analyzing these logs, I'd consider whether the powershell script is legitimate or part of an attack. Since it's using Restricted ExecutionPolicy, which usually restricts script execution, but in this case, it's being used to read files and check for certain strings.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern where multiple events like this occur together. Maybe the script is trying to enumerate system information, which could be part of reconnaissance before an attack. The confidence here isn't super high because without more context, it's hard to tell, but the combination does raise some red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell process with a command that reads .inf files and checks for specific patterns, which may indicate malicious activity or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at these JSONL logs, and each one represents an event from the system. There are multiple entries here, so I'll need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nFirst off, I notice that almost all the events involve PowerShell.exe being executed with some command-line arguments. The execution policy is set to Restricted in all cases, which is a bit concerning because sometimes attackers use restricted policies to hide their activities. But it's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the first few entries have a simple Write-Host command that outputs 'Final result: 1'. That seems pretty benign—maybe some script or application is just checking a condition and outputting a status. However, later events have more complex commands. For example, they're querying the Windows directory's INF files and searching for specific patterns related to installation sections like [defaultinstall.nt*]. This could be part of legitimate software installation or configuration, but it might also be something else.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what these mean in the context of PowerShell logs. Maybe they relate to how modules are being loaded or executed? If so, repeated calls to these lifecycle events could indicate something unusual, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that many of these events repeat multiple times—there are several identical command lines across different entries. This repetition makes me think it's part of a loop or script that's running multiple checks. Could this be an attempt to gather information about the system over time? Or maybe it's just a legitimate process checking certain conditions periodically.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with normal system behavior. Are there standard processes that would involve reading INF files and using PowerShell in such a way? It's possible, especially during software installations or updates. However, the combination of restricted execution policies and repeated checks on sensitive files like INF (which are often related to device drivers) raises some flags.\n\nMoreover, the fact that some events have different 'task' values—like switching between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'—could indicate a more complex script or module loading process. This might not be suspicious by itself, but when combined with the file access patterns, it's worth noting.\n\nLooking at the files accessed, all entries either don't mention a file (file: None) or are accessing specific INF files in the Windows directory. This could relate to checking for drivers or system components. If an attacker is trying to identify installed drivers or check for certain configurations, this kind of activity would make sense as part of reconnaissance.\n\nI'm also thinking about indicators of compromise (IoCs). While these events don't directly point to known malicious activities, the pattern of repeated PowerShell executions with specific commands and file accesses could be part of a larger campaign. It's possible that an attacker is using legitimate tools in a way that's not overtly malicious but still concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell running scripts with restricted policies, checking system files, and repeating similar actions—this batch feels like it could indicate something unusual or potentially malicious. The activities aren't clearly benign, and the repetition suggests a possible automated process, which might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with restricted policies and file access patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to understand this data that's been provided. It looks like a series of JSON objects with various fields like process, winlog, and file. I'm not entirely sure what each field represents, but from the names, I can guess that \"process\" might relate to running applications or commands, \"winlog\" could be Windows logs or events, and \"file\" probably refers to files involved.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of base64 encoded strings under the \"process\" field. That seems complicated because I don't know how to decode those right now. But then later on, starting from the third entry, it shows powershell.exe commands being executed. Those are creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it. The last entries have simpler command lines where PowerShell writes a message to the host.\n\nI'm thinking that this might be part of some automated script or maybe even malicious activity because there's a lot of repeated commands, especially with powershell.exe which can be used for both legitimate scripting and attacks. The creation of a new service could be an attempt to install something persistently on the system.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to interpret all these entries together. Are they logs from some monitoring tool? Each entry seems to have process information, sometimes with command lines, Windows log task names, and file paths. The presence of base64 strings makes me think there might be some obfuscation or encoding for certain fields.\n\nI also notice that the files mentioned in later entries point to specific directories like \"unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\", which is Portuguese for \"logical unit\\common registry\\base entry\\bin\". That's a bit concerning because it suggests someone is accessing system-level directories, which could be dangerous if they're writing or modifying files there without proper authorization.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands makes me think that an attacker might be trying to execute arbitrary code on the system. The creation and starting of a new service (\"objeto_ativo\") could indicate setting up a backdoor or persistence mechanism so that even after rebooting, the service would start automatically.\n\nI'm also curious about the base64 strings in the first entries. If I were to decode them, maybe they reveal more details like process IDs or other system information. But without knowing the exact structure of what's being encoded, it's hard to say. Maybe those are serialized objects or logs from a specific tool.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field mentions tasks like \"Process Create\", \"Provider Lifecycle\", and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These terms seem related to Windows event logging categories. For example, \"Process Create\" would indicate that a new process was created, which aligns with the command lines seen in the data.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'm hypothesizing that this log captures an attack vector where an adversary is using PowerShell to execute commands on a system. The creation of a service suggests an attempt at persistence, while the repeated execution might be part of a script trying multiple actions or attempting to stay undetected.\n\nI should consider how to respond to such data if I were tasked with analyzing it for security purposes. First, decoding those base64 strings would be crucial to understand the full context of the processes being created. Next, identifying the source of these commands—whether from a legitimate script or malicious activity—is essential. Checking the integrity of system files and services, as well as network traffic, could help determine if an attack is underway.\n\nI might also look into whether the directories mentioned in the file paths have the correct permissions and ownership. If they're being accessed by unauthorized processes, that's a red flag. Additionally, correlating these logs with other sources like firewall logs or user activity could provide more context on when and how this activity occurred.\n\nOverall, my understanding is that this data represents potential malicious activities using PowerShell to create persistent services on a system. To confirm this, I would need to analyze the decoded process information, trace the execution flow, and see if there are any known indicators of compromise associated with these commands.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided data represents potential malicious activity where an attacker is using PowerShell to execute commands on a system, possibly attempting to establish persistence by creating and starting services. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **Initial Entries**: The first entries contain base64 encoded strings under the \"process\" field, which likely encode detailed process information but are not decoded here.\n\n2. **PowerShell Commands**: From the third entry onwards, powershell.exe commands are observed. These include:\n   - Creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path.\n   - Starting the newly created service, indicating an attempt to make it persistent across reboots.\n\n3. **File Paths**: The commands reference directories like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\", suggesting access to system-level directories, which is concerning if unauthorized.\n\n4. **Winlog Tasks**: Entries include tasks such as \"Process Create\" and \"Provider\/Engine Lifecycle,\" indicating process creation events and service-related activities.\n\n5. **Later Commands**: The last entries show simpler PowerShell commands writing messages to the host, possibly indicating a script's completion or a test of persistence.\n\n**Conclusion**: The data suggests an attack vector where an adversary uses PowerShell for potentially malicious purposes, including creating persistent services. To address this, decoding base64 strings would provide more context, checking process creation events, verifying file integrity and permissions, and correlating logs with other security data is recommended to confirm the nature of the activity."}
