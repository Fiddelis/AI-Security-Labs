Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: A process named \"SDXHelper.exe\" loaded the file \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\combase.dll\". That seems normal because these are standard system files, but I wonder if SDXHelper is a legitimate process or something else. Not sure yet.\n\nNext up, \"svchost.exe\" made a registry change. Svchost is commonly used by services in Windows, so this isn't unusual unless it's modifying sensitive areas without reason. Nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nThen there are several events from \"EXCEL.EXE\". It loaded combase.dll and other .dlls which look like standard Excel components. Each time, different files are being loaded, but they all seem to be within the expected paths for Office applications.\n\nThere's an event where a file was created by EXCEL: \"real_values.csv.LNK\" in the Recent folder. Shortcuts or recent files aren't inherently bad, but sometimes attackers use them as part of their activities. However, given that it's Excel creating a recent file link, this seems normal unless there's something unusual about the filename.\n\nAnother event is a DNS query from EXCEL, which again is standard behavior for an application trying to access online resources or check updates.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple instances of EXCEL.EXE loading system files and creating files in user folders. The process names are legitimate, and the actions taken are typical for Excel running normally. There's no indication of any malicious activities like unusual file accesses, writes to unexpected locations, or anomalies in process behavior.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as processes accessing restricted areas, multiple failed attempts, or changes that shouldn't happen during normal operation. All events seem within the baseline of a user running Excel and related services.\n\nSo overall, while I'm not 100% certain there's no malicious activity, based on the information given, it doesn't rise to the level of being concerning. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal processes like Excel loading standard system files and creating recent file shortcuts, which are typical user activity without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
