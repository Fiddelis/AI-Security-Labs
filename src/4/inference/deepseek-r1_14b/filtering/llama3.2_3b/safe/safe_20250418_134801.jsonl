Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: Microsoft Edge update is creating a file. That seems normal because updates often create temporary files during installation.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries about \"Special Logon\" and \"User Account Management.\" These might be related to user login or system processes adjusting account permissions, which isn't unusual on its own.\n\nThen I see taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll. Taskhost is part of Windows Task Scheduler, so it's expected to load that DLL. No red flags here.\n\nThere are a couple of events where powershell.exe creates files. PowerShell can be used maliciously, but in this case, the path seems legitimate—something related to StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. It doesn't look suspicious.\n\nMsMpEng.exe is part of Windows Defender. It's setting a registry value and loading taskschd.dll again. That's normal for antivirus operations.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating its own config file makes sense if it's an agent running, maybe for log management. The path seems okay.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe also loads taskschd.dll. Compatibility Telemetry is part of Windows, so that's standard.\n\nSVCHost.exe creating a file in the Delivery Optimization Cache—this relates to Windows Update and caching files for updates. Not unusual.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creates an update file again; same as the first event.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading itself from ProgramData—that’s where Defender stores its components, so normal.\n\nThere's a File Delete logged by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, which is probably cleaning up old files, so that's fine.\n\nGit.exe creating several files in a node_modules directory. This looks like someone working on a Node.js project, maybe running npm commands or building something. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are normal system activities—updates, user logons, process initializations, and development tools (git) being used. There's nothing that stands out as malicious or indicating a breach. All the processes and file operations fit within expected system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as updates, user logons, process initializations, and legitimate software usage without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"RATING\": \"0\"\n}"}

Each one is a JSON object with details about a file creation event on a Windows system. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git or GitHub actions. \n\nThe files being created are all within the node_modules directory, specifically under \"semver\". I know that semver is a Node.js package used for semantic versioning. The fact that multiple files are being created here makes me think this is part of a typical npm install process, where dependencies are being downloaded and extracted.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they include functions like diff.js, gt.js, etc., which are standard parts of the semver module. There's also package.json, which is normal for npm modules. The internal files like constants.js and debug.js also fit the expected structure.\n\nSince all these events are related to a Git process installing or updating a Node.js package, it doesn't raise any red flags. No signs of unusual file creation patterns, access to restricted areas, or execution of suspicious processes. It looks like routine development activity rather than anything malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate normal file creation activities related to a Git process and Node.js semver package installation, which is typical for development environments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nAll the events have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes sense because Git is a version control tool often used in development environments. The task under winlog is consistently \"File created\", which aligns with Git cloning or fetching repositories where it creates new files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to various modules and packages inside a directory structure related to a course on software quality. For example, there are entries for node_modules, README.md, package.json, index.js, etc. These are typical files you'd find when installing Node.js packages or setting up a project.\n\nEach event is creating a file, which seems normal during the setup or update of a project using Git and npm. The fact that multiple files from different modules are being created suggests that someone is working on a Node.js project, possibly cloning it for the first time or updating dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. No failed processes, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute binaries. It's all about file creation in standard development directories. Unless there's context suggesting this user shouldn't be working with these files, like an unauthorized access attempt, this activity doesn't raise red flags.\n\nSo overall, the events look legitimate and part of normal software development workflows. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files during a standard Node.js project setup, which is normal behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at these logs. So, I see that all the events are from the same process named \"git.exe\". The task in each log is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means Git is creating files somewhere on the system.\n\nThe file paths are pointing to various modules and their subdirectories within a user's directory structure. Specifically, it's inside \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\". The directories being accessed include \"node_modules\" with names like \"side-channel\", \"signal-exit\", \"slice-ansi\", and \"sshpk\". These all look like Node.js packages, which makes sense if someone is working on a project that uses npm.\n\nEach log shows Git creating different files—LICENSEs, README.md files, JavaScript scripts, and other module-related files. This pattern suggests that the user is installing or updating these Node modules using Git as part of their development workflow. It's common for developers to clone repositories or check out code using Git, which would involve creating a lot of files in one go.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is legitimate (Git), and the files being created are standard parts of a Node.js project setup. There's nothing unusual like access to restricted areas, creation of suspicious files, or deviations from normal user behavior. Since all activities are within expected bounds for someone working on software development with Git and npm, there's no indication that this batch is related to any malicious behavior.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these events are routine and don't pose a security risk.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating files during a typical project setup or development activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. All the entries are JSON objects related to file creations on Windows. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which suggests that Git is being used here. \n\nThe files being created are located in various subdirectories under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Specifically, these files and directories are part of a Node.js module structure. For example, there's \"node_modules\" which is typical for npm packages, and specific modules like \"sshpk\", \"string-width\", \"strip-ansi\", etc. Each event shows the creation of files such as .js scripts, package.json, license files, and readme.md.\n\nSo what's happening here? It looks like Git is cloning or updating a repository that includes these Node.js packages. The repeated file creations under node_modules are normal when setting up a project with dependencies. These actions are part of the standard process for developers using npm and Git to manage their projects.\n\nIs there anything unusual? All events are from the same user, fiddelis, and all files relate to software development tools. There's no indication of access times that seem off, nor are there any files being created outside of typical project structures. No suspicious file names or paths that stand out as malicious.\n\nI don't see evidence of anything like unauthorized access, encryption (which would suggest ransomware), or deletions. All the activities here fit within normal software development and version control workflows. The fact that Git is involved doesn't raise any red flags on its own—it's a common tool for developers.\n\nTherefore, this batch isn't showing signs of malicious activity.

Let me start by examining each event individually.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event where the process name is \"git.exe\". The task in winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means a file was created. The file paths are all within the same directory, specifically under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\", with different filenames like decompose.js, enums.js, fail.js, and so on.\n\nI notice that all these events share a common process name and are related to file creation. The files being created are JavaScript libraries under the node_modules folder. Since \"node_modules\" is typically where third-party Node.js packages are stored, it's normal for Git to interact with these files during operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are 18 events in this batch, each corresponding to a different file being created by git.exe. This seems consistent with Git's behavior when initializing or updating a project's node_modules directory. There's no indication of unusual paths or filenames that might suggest malicious activity. All files appear to be standard components of the tcomb library.\n\nI don't see any red flags like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or deviations from typical file creation patterns. Each event follows the expected pattern for a Git process dealing with its repository's dependencies.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it doesn't seem like this batch indicates any malicious behavior. The activities are within normal operational parameters for a system using Node.js and Git.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or when initializing a project with Node.js dependencies.
