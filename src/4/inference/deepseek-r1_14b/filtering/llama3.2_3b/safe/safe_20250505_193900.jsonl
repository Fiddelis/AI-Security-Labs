{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common system process, but sometimes malware can hide under it. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, Explorer.EXE also sets a registry value. Explorer is a core Windows process; maybe just normal activity.\n\nThird event has no process and task as None, probably not relevant.\n\nFourth to seventh events are all from chrome.exe setting registry values, creating pipes, and making DNS queries. Chrome does do these things regularly, but could they be indicators of something malicious? Maybe unusual if the number is high or actions are out of place.\n\nEighth event has no process and task as Special Logon, which might indicate a user logon event, probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nNinth event from svchost.exe with a network connection. Network connections can be malicious, especially from processes that shouldn't initiate them. This is a red flag.\n\nTenth to twelfth events again involve chrome.exe with more registry changes and loading taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. I'm not sure if this is normal for Chrome.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of svchost.exe making registry changes and one network connection event stand out. These could be signs of a process doing something it shouldn't, possibly indicating malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (svchost.exe and chrome.exe) showing unusual behavior such as registry modifications and network connections suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
