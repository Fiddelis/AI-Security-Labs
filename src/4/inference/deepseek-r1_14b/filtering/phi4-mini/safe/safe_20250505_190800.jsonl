{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The first few entries show powershell loading various .NET files like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. These are normal for script execution, so that doesn't raise a red flag on its own.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe creates a file called teste.ps1 in the Downloads folder. Then, another event shows powershell accessing this file with command-line parameters including \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\". Bypassing execution policy is a common tactic to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked, so this might indicate malicious activity.\n\nI also notice multiple instances of FileCreate and FileDelete events for temporary files like __PSScriptPolicyTest*. These are often used by attackers to test if their script complies with the execution policy before running it. Deleting these files after testing could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value sets from Explorer.exe and mmc.exe, which seem unrelated to powershell. And winlogbeat.exe creating some config file, which is likely just normal logging setup.\n\nThe repeated ImageLoad events for .NET framework components by powershell might suggest script execution, but without more context on what the scripts do, it's hard to say. However, combined with the use of Bypass Execution Policy and the creation\/deletion of test files, this batch does raise some suspicions.\n\nI'm not seeing any overt signs like network connections or known malicious file hashes, so my confidence isn't too high, but there are enough red flags around powershell's activity to consider this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including execution policy bypass and temporary script creation\/deletion suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
