{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That's pretty normal because Chrome makes a lot of connections and queries when browsing the web. Nothing suspicious here on its own.\n\nThen I notice several events related to powershell.exe. The first one is about a registry value being set, which caught my attention. PowerShell scripts often interact with the registry for configuration or persistence, so that's something to look into. But more concerning are the command lines in some of these processes. They have commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', and 'cmdkey.exe \/list'. These commands can be used to gather user information and list cached credentials, which is a red flag because attackers often do this for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event for a PowerShell script in the temp directory. The filename has some random characters, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection. Then immediately after creating it, the same file is deleted. This temporary script might have executed something malicious before being removed to cover tracks.\n\nThere are also multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET framework components, they can be used in attacks to execute code or load malicious payloads. The fact that there are several of these might indicate some kind of script execution or lateral movement.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line. This repetition could mean that a script is being executed multiple times or is part of a loop, which isn't typical for normal script usage and might be an attempt to maintain persistence or spread across systems.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags: suspicious PowerShell commands, creation and deletion of a temp script, repeated events suggesting persistent activity, and the use of legitimate tools in ways that align with attack behaviors. While not conclusive on their own, the combination points towards potential malicious activity that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, including user enumeration and credential dumping activities, along with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as lateral movement or persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the data directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so it probably creates its configuration files periodically.\n\nNext, I notice several powershell.exe processes with command lines that include commands like net user and get-localgroupmember. These are red flags because using PowerShell for such tasks could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance. The fact that they're querying users and groups suggests someone might be checking permissions or trying to gain access.\n\nThen there's a process where powershell.exe loads the MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That seems okay on its own since Defender uses these components, but combined with other events involving PowerShell commands, it adds some context.\n\nLooking further, I see net.exe and cmdkey.exe being used. These are legitimate system tools, but their use in conjunction with powershell might indicate someone trying to access credentials or network information. For example, cmdkey \/list would show stored credentials, which could be a way to gather sensitive info.\n\nThere's also an updater.exe running from the GoogleUpdater directory. That looks like standard software update checks and shouldn't raise any concerns by itself.\n\nThe events where chrome.exe sets registry values multiple times seem benign. Browsers often modify registry settings for updates or configurations without any malicious intent.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which could be part of legitimate configuration tasks, but again, combined with other suspicious activities, it's worth noting.\n\nFinally, there are repeated ImageLoad events from SDXHelper.exe and processes accessing each other. These don't seem immediately suspicious unless they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch has multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that could be used for lateral movement or data collection. The use of net.exe, cmdkey.exe, and creating files in specific directories adds to the suspicion. While each individual event might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity, such as an attacker using PowerShell to gain access or move within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that could indicate lateral movement or data collection activities. Additionally, there are processes involving net.exe and cmdkey.exe which may be used for privilege escalation or credential dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a process named conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows, but sometimes it can be used maliciously. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That seems normal because urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs. But I should check if SDXHelper is known for anything suspicious.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool used for log management, so it's probably legitimate. The filename looks like a config file being updated, which makes sense.\n\nAfter that, powershell.exe created modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but creating files isn't inherently bad. However, the filename sounds technical, and I should keep an eye on what this script does.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was run with some parameters. The command line includes \"installsource scheduler,\" which sounds like it's part of Edge's update process. But sometimes malicious updates can use similar names, so maybe worth checking if this is legitimate.\n\nsvchost.exe set a registry value. SvcHost is a common process for running DLLs; many services run under it. Could be normal or could be something else.\n\nAnother MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loaded taskschd.dll. Taskschd is related to task scheduling, which aligns with the update process. But again, I'm cautious because Edge updates can sometimes have issues.\n\nPowershell was accessed again and set a registry value. Multiple powershell events in quick succession might indicate something malicious, especially if they're modifying system settings.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows several normal activities like log file creation by winlogbeat and legitimate processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell instances doing registry operations is concerning. Malware often uses PowerShell for tasks like persistence or privilege escalation. Also, conhost.exe and powershell.exe are both tools that can be misused. The combination could indicate a potential attack, especially if these actions are part of an exploit chain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch includes multiple events involving processes known for potentially malicious activities, such as conhost.exe and PowerShell, which have performed suspicious actions like registry modifications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Conhost.exe Activity**: The process conhost.exe is involved in setting a registry value. While conhost is typically related to console windows, it's sometimes used by malware for malicious purposes.\n   \n2. **SDXHelper.exe Loading urlmon.dll**: SDXHelper loading a known Windows DLL might be normal, but without additional context, it could be suspicious.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Creating Configuration File**: This seems legitimate as winlogbeat is an open-source tool, and creating config files is part of its operation.\n\n4. **Powershell.exe Creating modulo_base.txt**: PowerShell's versatility makes it a favorite for attackers. The creation of this file raises an eyebrow.\n\n5. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution**: While Edge updates are legitimate, the command-line parameters suggest automated behavior which could be malicious.\n\n6. **SvcHost.exe Registry Modification**: SvcHost is common but can also run malicious code. This event adds to the concern.\n\n7. **Multiple Powershell Instances**: The repeated use of PowerShell with registry operations increases suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of conhost.exe, multiple powershell instances modifying system settings, and potential edge update activities could indicate malicious behavior. There's enough evidence to warrant further investigation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes like conhost.exe and powershell.exe performed potentially malicious actions such as registry modifications. This indicates possible malicious activity that merits further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
