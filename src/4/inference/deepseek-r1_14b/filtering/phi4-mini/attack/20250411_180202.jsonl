{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something via a process access rule. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention.\n\nNext, whoami.exe running without any command line arguments seems normal. It's often used to check user information, so I don't think this is suspicious on its own.\n\nThe third event again involves powershell.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, which makes me more alert.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe spawning notepad.exe via WMIC. Using command-line tools like cmd and WMIC to execute processes can be a red flag because it allows execution under different permissions or bypassing certain security measures. This is something I should pay closer attention to.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times with various actionsâ€”accessing, creating files, modifying the registry. The repetition of these activities could indicate scripting or automated behavior, which might be malicious.\n\nThere are several instances where cmd.exe and WMIC.exe are used to load images or set registry values. These tools can be vectors for command injection and persistence, so their repeated use is concerning.\n\nAdditionally, an event where a file 'objeto_temporario.txt' is created by powershell.exe stands out. Temporary files created by scripts can be part of malicious activities like storing stolen data or tools for further attacks.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file seems legitimate since it's likely related to log shipping or monitoring, but I should consider if there are any anomalies here.\n\nLastly, the RuntimeBroker.exe and other processes modifying registry values might not be suspicious on their own, but when combined with other events, they contribute to an overall concerning pattern.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe performing actions that could be part of a malicious script or payload. The use of these tools in succession, especially creating files and modifying the registry, suggests potential compromise or attack activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe with actions like file creation and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
