Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the initial event shows 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's usually benign because it's used to display user information, but sometimes attackers use it for reconnaissance, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of 'powershell.exe' with varying tasks. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by both admins and attackers. The command lines look suspicious. They have commands like findstr searching for 'pass' in various file types and then using select-string to look for the pattern 'password'. This seems like an attempt to harvest credentials or sensitive information, which raises a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading images. These activities can be part of legitimate operations, but repeated RegistryEvent and ImageLoad tasks might indicate malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or loading malicious DLLs.\n\nI notice that a script '__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1' was created and then immediately deleted. This behavior is often seen in attempts to bypass script execution policies by creating and deleting the file quickly. It's a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nThere are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks from PowerShell, which might be normal if it's part of configuration, but repeated occurrences could indicate something more nefarious, like establishing persistence or loading malicious modules.\n\nAnother event shows notepad.exe accessing registry values. While notepad is generally harmless, any unexpected registry access by a benign process could be a sign of tampering or an attempt to log keystrokes.\n\nLastly, 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a config file seems normal unless it's part of an attack, but given the other events, I can't rule out that it's related.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing suspicious commands, file creation and deletion of a script, registry access, repeated provider lifecycle tasks—all these point towards potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the pattern suggests an attacker trying to gather credentials or establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell executing potentially malicious commands, including searching for sensitive patterns in files and registry manipulation, along with the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's an event from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common process that can be legitimate or part of malware, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. That seems normal since system32 files are standard, so probably not malicious.\n\nThen, findstr.exe is used with a command searching for \"pass\" in various file types. This could be legitimate if the user is looking for passwords or something else, but it might also be a red flag because search strings related to sensitive info can indicate data theft.\n\nOfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query seems normal unless the domain queried is suspicious.\n\nPowershell.exe running a script that searches for \"password\" using findstr. This could be malicious because PowerShell is often used in attacks, and searching for passwords might be an attempt to harvest credentials. Alternatively, it could be a sysadmin doing legitimate work.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That's concerning because non-interactive profiles shouldn't run scripts without good reason, possibly indicating persistence mechanisms.\n\nConhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and Calculator.exe all setting registry values. These are standard processes, but frequent registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying areas that malware targets.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe events with registry modifications and network connections. Chrome is a common process, so this might just be normal activity unless the domains accessed or files loaded are malicious.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. This is likely part of log shipping and shouldn't be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of PowerShell activity, especially using findstr to search for sensitive terms. Powershell is a favorite tool for attackers because it's powerful and can execute code silently. The repeated registry modifications and file creations by powershell.exe could indicate malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration. While some events are normal, the combination raises red flags.\n\nI'm 85% confident that this batch is interesting due to potential malicious use of PowerShell and suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe executing scripts, searching for sensitive terms like 'password', and creating files in non-interactive profiles.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are two instances where powershell.exe created files named \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. But sometimes it's also used legitimately. So the creation of these files could be a red flag, but without knowing what's inside them, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying registry values. That's a bit unusual for Chrome because it typically doesn't make such changes unless something is wrong or if there's some malicious activity. However, sometimes legitimate software can change registry settings during updates or configuration, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values again. This could be an attempt to hide traces or gain persistence. Processes being accessed might indicate that another program is trying to monitor or control them, which could be malicious.\n\nLooking at whoami.exe running from the system32 directory—that's normal because it's a standard command-line tool to get user information. But sometimes attackers use it to gather info about the system, so I should note that but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThere are several schtasks.exe processes being created and deleted with specific task names like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". Task Scheduler tasks are often used by malware for persistence or scheduled execution. Deleting existing tasks might be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent other actions.\n\nSVCHOST.exe modifying the registry is concerning because it's a common process name used by legitimate services but can also be exploited by malware. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is normal behavior.\n\nCMD.exe setting registry values and executing commands like deleting notepad.exe processes stands out. Using command-line tools to delete processes is something attackers might do to cover their tracks or terminate protective processes. The use of WMIC.exe for process deletion is also a common technique in attacks because it allows remote execution and can bypass certain security measures.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple signs that could indicate malicious activity: PowerShell creating files, accessing processes, setting registry values; repeated Chrome registry changes which seem out of place; Schtasks deleting tasks possibly to avoid detection; CMD and WMIC being used for process deletion which is often seen in attacks. These events collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or an attack.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these could be part of normal system operations. For example, legitimate software might use some of these tools, but the combination and frequency seem suspicious. The repeated use of different tools (PowerShell, CMD, WMIC) to perform similar actions adds up.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because there are multiple red flags pointing towards potential malicious behavior. But I need to be confident enough given the evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicative of potential malicious activity, including suspicious PowerShell operations, repeated registry modifications by Chrome, task deletions with schtasks.exe, and use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and WMIC.exe for process deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what we've got here. The user has provided a batch of JSONL events and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to spot any patterns or red flags. Starting with the first few entries: multiple instances where WMIC.exe is loading different DLLs. That's a bit concerning because WMIC is often used for remote command execution and can be a vector for attacks. The fact that it's loading several system files like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll might indicate some sort of malicious activity trying to bypass antivirus or AMSI checks.\n\nThen I notice a series of process creations involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. The command lines show commands like deleting users with specific names ending in \"_Admin\". That seems suspicious because why would someone delete multiple user accounts? It could be an attempt to remove traces or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking deeper into the command lines:\n- cmd.exe is being used with \"\/c\" which suggests it's executing a single command and then terminating.\n- The commands like \"net user \/del\" are used to delete users, both locally and in the domain. This kind of activity could be part of an attack where an attacker is trying to clean up or modify account structures.\n- Powershell.exe being accessed multiple times without file paths might indicate script execution, which can be a way to hide malicious activities.\n\nI also see that some events involve registry value sets. This makes me think the attacker might be attempting persistence mechanisms by modifying the Windows Registry.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch of logs shows repeated attempts to delete user accounts using various command-line tools, often through processes that are known for their flexibility and can be used maliciously. The combination of WMIC loading DLLs and multiple process creations with deletion commands suggests a potential attack where an adversary is trying to compromise the system by removing users, possibly as part of privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThe repeated nature of these events across different tools (cmd, powershell, net, etc.) increases my concern. It looks like someone is systematically targeting user accounts, which could be a precursor to more severe actions like installing malware or accessing restricted areas.\n\nWhile I'm not seeing clear indicators of a successful breach yet, the pattern of behavior is definitely concerning. The use of multiple tools and repeated attempts to delete users are red flags that might indicate an active attack or at least malicious intent.\n\nSo, in terms of classification, this batch should be marked as interesting because it exhibits signs of potentially harmful activity. My confidence is high enough to rate it around 0.85 on the scale since there's a strong pattern but no direct evidence of exploitation yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations and deletions of user accounts, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as privilege escalation or system compromise.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n\n1. cmd.exe is being used with a command to delete \"win32times\". That sounds suspicious because deleting services can be part of malicious activities.\n2. powershell.exe is accessed, which is often used for scripting and can be abused by attackers.\n3. Another cmd.exe event shows registry value setting, which might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations.\n4. sc.exe is used with the same delete command as before, reinforcing the idea that services are being targeted.\n\nI notice multiple instances where processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are creating or accessing registry keys and deleting files. For example, there's a file deletion in %Temp% which could be hiding traces of malicious activities. The repeated use of these tools might indicate someone trying to establish persistence or cover their tracks.\n\nThere are several events where the same commands are run repeatedly, like deleting \"win32times\" with both cmd.exe and sc.exe. This repetition suggests a methodical approach, possibly clearing logs or services as part of an attack.\n\nThe later entries show powershell.exe accessing various .NET files. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination of these actions—accessing system binaries and modifying registry settings—raises flags. It could be related to lateral movement or deploying additional malicious payloads.\n\nPutting it all together, the events show a pattern of process creation, file deletion, and registry modifications using tools known for their versatility in attacks. The repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with suspicious commands makes this batch stand out as potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation, file deletion, and registry modifications using tools like cmd.exe and PowerShell indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is loading images and creating files. That's not unusual on its own since PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But seeing it create temporary files or load specific DLLs might be worth looking into, especially if those files don't seem to have a clear purpose.\n\nThen, there are several file creation events by PowerShell in the user's temp directory and under the Microsoft Windows PowerShell StartupProfileData folder. This could indicate script execution, which is a common tactic for attackers to run malicious code.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple deletions of these temporary files shortly after they're created. That's a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid detection. The fact that the same file is created and then deleted in quick succession makes me think this could be part of some script trying to stay under the radar.\n\nThere's an event where a new .winlogbeat.yml file is being created by winlogbeat.exe. That seems normal if it's part of their logging setup, but I need to consider whether this is expected behavior for that tool or if there's something suspicious about its path or content.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being run. While this could just be a user checking their permissions, in the context of other PowerShell activities, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system, which is often part of early attack stages like reconnaissance.\n\nThe process access events for both PowerShell and whoami.exe seem frequent. This could mean that another process is trying to inspect or interact with these processes, which might be a sign of lateral movement or privilege escalation if not legitimate.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe writes to the registry. Conhost is typically used by PowerShell to host console applications, but any unusual registry activity can be a vector for persistence mechanisms.\n\nFinally, there are events involving notepad.exe and calc.exe loading certain DLLs. While these are common processes, any unexpected image loads could indicate that malicious code is being injected or that legitimate tools are being misused.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with file creation\/deletion, process access, and whoami executions, along with other potentially suspicious activities like registry writes and image loads, suggests a possible attack. The combination of these events, especially the cleanup of temporary files and multiple process interactions, makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances show file creation\/deletion patterns, potentially malicious script execution, and repeated whoami.exe executions suggest possible attack activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are three events from svchost.exe where a registry value was set. Svchost is a common process that can be legitimate or malicious, but since these are just setting registry values without any other suspicious indicators, maybe not too concerning on their own.\n\nNext, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That seems normal if winlogbeat is running as intended to collect logs. No red flags here unless the path or activity is unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nThen, two events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things. Accessing process information could be part of legitimate script execution or it might be malicious. I need to consider if these accesses are expected behavior or not. Without more context on what the scripts are doing, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a common tool used to check user information and isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger attack chain, like privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events from chrome.exe related to DNS queries and network connections. Chrome being an internet browser, these activities are normal as it navigates the web. Unless the domains accessed are known malicious ones, which aren't indicated here, this shouldn't raise alarms.\n\nConsidering all these events together, none of them individually stand out as highly suspicious. The svchost.exe and chrome.exe activities are pretty standard. The winlogbeat activity is expected if that's a legitimate log tool running. The powershell accesses could be concerning but without more context or signs of malicious intent, it's hard to say. Similarly, whoami.exe is benign on its own.\n\nI don't see any clear indicators of compromise like repeated failed logins, unexpected file creations in system directories, or known malicious process names. Each event seems explainable within normal operational activities or standard user actions. There's no pattern suggesting a coordinated attack or exfiltration attempts.\n\nTherefore, while some events might warrant closer monitoring under certain circumstances, as a whole batch, they don't present enough evidence to justify an investigation. They fall into the category of \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no strong indication of malicious behavior when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities, including process creations and file operations, without any clear indicators of malicious behavior.
