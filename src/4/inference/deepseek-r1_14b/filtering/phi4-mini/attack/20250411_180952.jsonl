{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections. That seems normal because Chrome often establishes connections for browsing. But then I notice that powershell.exe is appearing a few times with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell can be used both benignly and maliciously, so that catches my attention. \n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed without any command line arguments beyond its own path. That might not be too concerning on its own, but combined with the other events involving powershell.exe, it could indicate something more.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances where cmd.exe is used to execute net and net1.exe commands. The commands are adding users and groups to the domain, specifically \"Domain Admins\". This seems suspicious because creating new domain admin accounts from a regular user account might require elevated privileges, which could be a sign of privilege escalation.\n\nThe command lines are using different admin usernames and passwords, like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with passwords like \"registro_temporario_pass123!\". These strong or varied credentials might indicate an attempt to create multiple high-privilege accounts, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity. \n\nThere's also conhost.exe being involved in registry changes. ConHost is often used by attackers to host payloads because it's commonly allowed by many security tools. This adds more concern.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events from powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe, but without seeing the content of those files or their paths, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, combined with the other activities, it's something to look into.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious behavior: using PowerShell and cmd.exe to create new domain admin accounts, which could be part of an attack chain like credential dumping or lateral movement. The varied usernames and passwords suggest automation or script execution, possibly from a compromised account.\n\nI'm confident enough that these activities are unusual and could indicate an ongoing security incident, especially the use of powershell.exe for registry modifications and the addition of multiple admin accounts. This batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated PowerShell usage, creation of new domain admin accounts with unusual names, and use of conhost.exe which is often associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
