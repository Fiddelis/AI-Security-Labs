{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. Each one has a slightly different name in the command, like \"unidade_ativo$object\" or \"registro_geral$object\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a script trying to create several scheduled tasks. Since these are all using Powershell and creating tasks at logon with admin privileges, that's a red flag because attackers often use such methods for persistence.\n\nThen there are events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what that implies, but since it's paired with powershell.exe commands, it might be related to task creation or registration.\n\nLooking further down, some entries don't have command_line specified, just process name as powershell.exe. This could mean they're either background processes or perhaps the script is being executed in a way that doesn't show the full command line.\n\nThere are also events where Powershell accesses the registry and creates files in temporary directories. For example, one event shows a file created in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific PS script name, and then another event deletes it. This behavior is concerning because creating temporary scripts and deleting them afterward can be part of an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where chrome.exe creates a pipe and accesses the registry. While Chrome doing this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the combination with all the Powershell activities might indicate some lateral movement or misuse of legitimate processes.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of Powershell to create multiple scheduled tasks, especially using admin privileges and targeting logon events, is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The temporary file creation and deletion could be steps in executing a script without leaving evidence. While there's some normal behavior like image loading, the overall pattern suggests an attack or at least unauthorized access.\n\nI need to consider if this is just regular user activity or something more nefarious. Given that these logs show multiple attempts to create persistent tasks, registry modifications, and temporary file handling, it seems beyond ordinary usage. Therefore, this batch should definitely be looked into for possible security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell Instances:** Several events show powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines that create scheduled tasks. This repetition suggests automated or script-based activity.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Creation:** Each task is created under the same user context (admin privileges) and at logon, a common technique for persistence in attacks.\n\n3. **Temporary File Handling:** Powershell creates and immediately deletes temporary files, which can be used to hide malicious activities or script execution.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:** Events indicate registry access, often used by malware to maintain configurations or persistence.\n\n5. **Combination of Activities:** The combination of task creation, file operations, and registry changes points towards potential exploit activity rather than normal user behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs exhibits signs indicative of malicious activities, such as creating persistent tasks, using temporary files to hide actions, and modifying system configurations. Therefore, it is **interesting** for further investigation into possible security incidents or breaches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_interesting\": true,\n  \"reasons\": [\n    \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges.\",\n    \"Temporary file creation and deletion in the AppData directory.\",\n    \"Registry access events which could indicate persistence mechanisms.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at each event and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first event involves a PowerShell script that creates a scheduled task with calc.exe as the action. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task can be a common tactic in attacks, especially if it's set to run on logon with high privileges. This could indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where Chrome.exe is involved, but most seem related to registry changes. These might not be malicious by themselves, but when combined with other activities, they could raise flags. Also, the repeated 'Registry value set' tasks in Chrome's context make me think of possible tampering or configuration changes that shouldn't be there.\n\nThere are several events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This is concerning because executing commands remotely without proper authorization can indicate remote attacks or command-and-control activities. The fact that this happens multiple times across different processes raises my suspicion about potential botnet activity or unauthorized remote access.\n\nThen, I notice WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WMI-related processes are often targeted in attacks because they allow for stealthy communication and task scheduling. This could be part of a larger attack chain, using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nSVCHost.exe modifying registry entries is another red flag. SVCHost is commonly used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware to hide its presence. The fact that it's setting registry values multiple times might be an attempt to create persistence or modify system behavior in a way that's hard to trace.\n\nThe PowerShell processes creating files and modifying the registry are concerning too. They could be part of script execution that's either setting up scripts for later execution (like at logon) or attempting to cover their tracks by deleting or moving files. The creation of 'entrada_principal.txt' seems like a custom file, which might store configuration data for malicious activities.\n\nThe final events involve processes related to Winlogbeat and Chrome loading AMSI DLL. While these could be legitimate actions, the context of other suspicious activities makes me cautious. Perhaps an attacker is trying to disable AMSI or load malicious scripts through it, though in this case, it seems more like normal operation unless combined with other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a combination of PowerShell activity creating scheduled tasks, multiple remote command executions, registry modifications by various processes, and file creations that might be part of an attack chain. These activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, possibly indicating an ongoing attack or lateral movement within the network.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if all these events are directly linked to a single attack vector, but the volume and types of events are enough to warrant closer investigation. The confidence level is high due to the number of red flags and the nature of the activities observed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution, scheduled task creation with calc.exe, registry modifications, remote command executions, and file creations. These activities collectively indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"high\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is about setting a registry value. This happens six times in a row. Now, Chrome sometimes does modify the registry when it updates settings or extensions, so that's probably normal. But six times in a row might be a bit muchâ€”could it be something more malicious?\n\nThen there's an event where 'chrome.exe' makes a DNS query. That seems standard because browsers do need to resolve domains. So I don't think that's suspicious.\n\nNext up is 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect logs, so it's setting up or updating its configuration file. The path seems legitimate too, so nothing wrong there.\n\nFinally, 'powershell.exe' creates a new file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripts and by attackers. Creating a file could be part of malicious activity, like downloading something or setting up persistence. The name 'objeto_auxiliar' translates to 'auxiliary object', which doesn't immediately ring alarm bells, but combined with the process, it might warrant closer look.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are normal, except for the Powershell file creation and possibly the repeated registry changes in Chrome. These could indicate potential malicious activity or just legitimate operations. Since there's a mix of usual and potentially concerning actions, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from Chrome modifying registry values and Powershell creating a file, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
