{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So, I see multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event.\n\nThe first thing that stands out is the repeated use of `chrome.exe` setting registry values. That seems unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify system-wide registry settings in such a repetitive manner. Especially seven times in a row? Maybe it's just a lot of tabs or extensions being loaded, but I'm not too sure.\n\nThen there's `whoami.exe` being executed. That's a standard command used to get user information. It could be legitimate for some system administration tasks, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious or not. However, in isolation, it might not raise red flags immediately.\n\nThe bulk of the events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and commands. I notice several instances where powershell is being called with specific command lines pointing to `.ps1` files. For example:\n- `\"command_line\": \"powershell.exe & {&\\\"C:\\\\elemento_secundario\\\\tarefa_comum\\\\componente_logico\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\" -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log}\"`\n\nThese scripts are named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, which sounds like it's designed to capture keystrokes. That's a classic indicator of malicious activity, as such scripts can be used for keylogging to steal sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, there are events where powershell.exe creates temporary files in the user's Temp directory and then deletes them immediately after. For example:\n- `\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"` followed by `\"task\": \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\"`\n\nThis behavior is concerning because creating and deleting files rapidly can be a tactic to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nLooking at the image loading events, powershell.exe is loading various DLLs which might indicate it's executing code that requires certain libraries. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, combined with the other indicators, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where the `Provider Lifecycle` task is logged under powershell.exe. I'm not entirely sure what this signifies, but it might relate to PowerShell's configuration or module loading, which could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting all these together: repeated registry modifications by Chrome (which seems odd), execution of whoami.exe, and multiple instances of powershell.exe running scripts with keylogging functionalities, along with rapid file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory. These are strong indicators of potential malicious activity. The use of `Get-Keystrokes` in script names is particularly worrying.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events does seem significant from a cybersecurity standpoint and could warrant further investigation to ensure there's no active threat on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described exhibit several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Registry Modifications by Chrome**: The repeated setting of registry values by `chrome.exe` is unusual and merits closer examination, as it may suggest unauthorized software attempting to modify system configurations.\n\n2. **Invocation of `whoami.exe`**: While `whoami.exe` can be legitimate for system administration tasks, its execution in this context should be monitored to rule out misuse for privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\n3. **Multiple PowerShell Instances with Suspicious Scripts**:\n   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with command lines pointing to `.ps1` scripts named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is concerning. These scripts are indicative of keylogging activities, a common tactic in cyberattacks to capture sensitive user input.\n   - The rapid creation and deletion of files in the Temp directory by PowerShell suggests efforts to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Image Loading Events**: The loading of various DLLs under `powershell.exe` could indicate the execution of malicious code requiring specific libraries, furthering suspicions of a potential threat.\n\n5. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: These events, while not entirely clear in their implications, may relate to PowerShell's configuration or module loading, potentially indicating setup for persistence.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these indicators strongly suggests the presence of malicious activity. Immediate action is advisable, including thorough system scans and monitoring for any signs of compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break down each event.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. This script name sounds suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware aiming to capture sensitive information like passwords or other inputs.\n\nLooking closer, the command lines are trying to execute these PowerShell scripts with parameters that specify log paths in the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because malicious actors commonly use such techniques to avoid detection and persistence across reboots.\n\nThere are also events where files related to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are being accessed or created. These could be part of a larger campaign trying to establish persistence or spread across systems. Additionally, there's an entry for conhost.exe interacting with the same script, which might indicate another method of execution or an attempt to hide processes.\n\nOther events include file creations by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe. While these can be legitimate, in this context, they seem out of place, especially if they're part of creating new files that don't align with normal system operations.\n\nI also see multiple instances where the same PowerShell script is being run from different paths. This repetition suggests a possible automated process or a script trying to execute across various locations, which could be indicative of lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activities such as unauthorized script execution, file creation in suspicious locations, and multiple attempts to run known malicious scripts. These indicators suggest a high confidence that this batch is worth investigating further for possible security threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and creating files, which are indicators of suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
