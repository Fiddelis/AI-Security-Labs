If all the file creation events happened almost simultaneously, it might indicate a bulk operation rather than individual file creations.\n- Be cautious about any unexpected or excessive file creation activity, as it could potentially indicate malware or other security threats.\n\nTo investigate further, you might want to:\n\n- Check if there are any security software logs or alerts related to these events.\n- Monitor the behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` to see if it's acting normally or if there are any abnormalities.\n- Review user activity around the time of the \"Security Group Management\" event to understand what might have triggered it."}
