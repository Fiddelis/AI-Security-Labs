Be cautious about its activities.\n\n5. **Unknown Process:**\n   - A process with no name was logged with no associated task or file event.\n\n6. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` created the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file multiple times, suggesting it might be stuck in a loop creating this file repeatedly.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process and why it's loading those DLLs.\n- Monitor `winlogbeat.exe` to ensure it's not stuck in an infinite loop of creating the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file.\n- Keep an eye on any unusual registry value changes or deletions that might indicate malicious activity."}
