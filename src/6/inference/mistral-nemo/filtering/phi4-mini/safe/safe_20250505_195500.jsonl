The file names start with `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` followed by a unique hash value.\n\nHere's an example of how these files are named:\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_098f6bcd4621d373cade4b8bbd6c99e57.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_4815162342ac4aed8a5cb7d6cccfdba5.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_90fb0ffb0c5688956340f7bb0a6bf765.js`\n\n**File Path:** All files are created in the following directory:\n```\nC:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c8af13e-93d8-47dd-b44b-102b9d864985\\Resources\\OfflineFiles\\\n```\n\n**Possible Reason:** Since the files are created by `SDXHelper.exe` and they are related to \"Office\" strings, it's likely that these files are generated or used by Microsoft Office applications. They might be cache files, update files, or language pack files for some Office component.\n\nHowever, without more context or further investigation, we cannot determine the exact purpose of these files or whether their creation indicates a security threat, software issue, or normal application behavior.\n\nTo learn more about these files, you could:\n\n1. Check if they are present in official Microsoft Office release notes or documentation.\n2. Search online for similar files created by `SDXHelper.exe` to see if others have encountered and explained them.\n3. Monitor the system and Office applications' behavior to determine if these files cause any issues or unwanted behaviors.\n4. If necessary, consult with a Microsoft support professional or an expert in Office software for guidance on these files."}

Installing or updating extensions.\n     2. Changes in browser settings or preferences.\n     3. Updates to the browser itself.\n\n3. **Image Loads by chrome.exe:**\n   - `urlmon.dll` is loaded from `C:\\Windows\\System32`, which is a Windows system file used for handling internet-related operations like downloading files or accessing resources on the web.\n   - `MpClient.dll` is loaded, which is related to Microsoft Defender (formerly Windows Defender).\n\nThe repeated creation of `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` files by SDXHelper.exe and several registry events by chrome.exe suggest that these processes are actively performing their intended tasks or updates around the time these logs were captured. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine if any of these events are anomalous or indicative of a security threat.\n\nFor comprehensive analysis, consider using dedicated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems like Splunk, IBM QRadar, or open-source alternatives such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), which can provide better correlation and detection capabilities for such events."}

The files being created are related to UI strings for different languages, such as English (US and GB), Spanish (Spain and Mexico), Greek, German, French, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Catalan.\n\n3. There seems to be a duplication in the creation of some language-specific files (e.g., `es-es-ui-strings-json_34dc303006909da491f8dbd89618d1b7.js` appears twice).\n\nHere are a few possibilities for why this might be happening:\n\n- **Office Update**: Microsoft Office regularly updates its resources, which might cause the creation of these files. The duplication could be due to incomplete or interrupted previous updates.\n\n- **Customization**: If the user has customized any Office settings or add-ins that affect language UI strings, it might cause these files to be recreated.\n\n- **Malware\/Ransomware**: In rare cases, malware or ransomware can affect system files and create duplicates or modify existing files.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any running background processes related to Office or other potentially problematic software.\n2. Run a full system scan using reputable antivirus\/antimalware software.\n3. If the duplication continues, consider creating a new user profile on Windows and log in with that profile to check if the issue persists.\n4. If the issue is Office-related, try repairing or reinstalling Office, or contacting Microsoft Support for further assistance.\n\nIf you're concerned about the performance impact of these duplicate files, you can delete them after confirming they are not needed by any running processes.

They were likely created or updated by Microsoft Office or one of its components.\n\n2. **Process Involvement**: The process involved in creating these files is `SDXHelper.exe`, which is a component related to Microsoft Office's Click-to-Run installation technology.
