However, without additional context or timestamps, we can't determine the exact frequency or time span over which these events occurred.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons for why you might be seeing these events:\n\n- **Office Add-in Service Update**: Microsoft Office regularly updates its components to ensure optimal performance and security. These files could be part of that update process.\n- **Cache Files Rebuilding**: Some Office applications use caching mechanisms to improve performance. The creation of these files might indicate a rebuild or flush of the cache, possibly due to an application restart or configuration change.\n- **Debugging or Development Activity**: If you're running debug builds or developing Office extensions, these files could be related to those activities.\n\nIf you're concerned about the frequency of these events or their impact on your system's performance, I'd recommend reaching out to Microsoft Support for guidance specific to your situation.

These files correspond to various language and locale combinations (en-US, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, zh-CN).\n   - A `transcription-strings.min.js` file was created in the `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2\\PackageResources\\dist\\en-us_web\\office-online-strings\\en-US` folder.\n   - A `taskpane.js` file was created in the same folder as the `transcription-strings.min.js`.\n\n2. **Registry Value Set by EXCEL.EXE:**\n   - An event occurred where a registry value was set, but no specific details about the registry key or its new value are provided.\n\n3. **Subsequent File Creation by SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Another JSON file (`mk-mk-ui-strings-json_d5d84409d668d3caadfc252ff722f991.js`) related to UI strings was created, following the pattern of earlier files.\n\nThese logs suggest that Microsoft Office (specifically Excel) and an process named `SDXHelper.exe` are performing various operations, such as creating or updating files and registry values. The files created by `SDXHelper.exe` appear to be related to user interface strings for different languages and locales, suggesting a potential update or configuration change involving language settings in Office."}
