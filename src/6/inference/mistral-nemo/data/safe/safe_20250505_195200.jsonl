This is likely a process related to Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **Task**: The task performed by this process was \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the SDXHelper process created new files.\n\n3. **Files Created**:\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min.<hash>.js` files were repeatedly created with different hashes.\n     - `<hash>` represents a unique hash value for each file, indicating that these are probably dynamically generated files based on some input or configuration change.\n     - The `.min.` suggests that these are minified JavaScript files, often used in production environments to reduce the size of JavaScript code.\n     - `officeaicopilot-strings` suggests that these files might be related to Office's AI copilot feature.\n\n4. **User Affected**: The user affected is \"fiddelis\". This could be a username or a unique identifier associated with this user on the system where these logs were generated.\n\n5. **Timeline**: The logs span from the oldest (95d62c37a...) to the newest (80da5e955c...), indicating that these files were created over time, possibly due to updates or configuration changes related to Office's AI copilot feature.\n\nGiven this information and assuming no malicious intent, it seems like a normal process of creating updated resource files as part of regular Office functionality. However, if this behavior is unexpected or unwanted, you might want to investigate further to understand why these files are being recreated repeatedly."}

This suggests that the file's content might be changing frequently.\n\n2. **Process name:** The process creating these files is named `SDXHelper.exe`. This could imply that the changes are related to Microsoft Office, as 'SDX' is often associated with Office products.\n\n3. **Location:** The files are being created in the local AppData folder for Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages, which further supports the idea that they're related to Office customizations or add-ins.\n\n4. **OfflineFiles folder:** The fact that these files are located in an 'OfflineFiles' folder could indicate that they're used when Office is running offline (i.e., without an internet connection).\n\nTo better understand why this file is being created and re-created with different hash values, you might want to look into what `officeaicopilot-strings.min.js` does, when it's triggered, and if there are any errors or warnings associated with its creation."}

The varying hash values could indicate different versions, languages, or other variations of the cached files.\n\nHere are a few things you can do:\n\n1. **Check if these files are necessary**: If you're not using any offline features in Microsoft Office and these files aren't causing any issues, you might consider deleting them to free up some disk space.\n\n2. **Monitor the process**: Keep an eye on `SDXHelper.exe` to understand why it's repeatedly creating these files. It could be due to updates, language pack installations, or other changes in your Office applications.\n\n3. **Update Office**: If you're using an outdated version of Microsoft Office, consider updating to the latest one. This might help optimize resource usage and reduce the frequency of these file creations."}
