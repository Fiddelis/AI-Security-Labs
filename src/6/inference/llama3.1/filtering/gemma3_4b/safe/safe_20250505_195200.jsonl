However, in real-world scenarios, it's essential to analyze the data further, considering factors such as user behavior, system configuration, and network activity, to ensure accurate classification.\n\nHere is a simple Python script using the scikit-learn library to classify the events:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import svm\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'process_name': ['SDXHelper.exe'] * 24,\n    'event_type': ['File created'] * 24,\n    'path': [f'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\excel-copilot-strings_*.js' for _ in range(24)]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define the feature columns\nfeature_cols = ['process_name', 'event_type']\n\n# Create an instance of the SVM classifier\nclf = svm.SVC()\n\n# Train the model using the data\nclf.fit(df[feature_cols], [0] * 24)  # The classification is 0 for normal operation\n\n# Predict the classification result\nresult = clf.predict(df[feature_cols])\n\nprint('Classification Result:')\nfor i in range(24):\n    print(f'Event {i+1}: Classification={result[i]}, Process={df.iloc[i][\"process_name\"]}, Event Type={df.iloc[i][\"event_type\"]} ')\n```\n\nNote that this script is a simplified example and doesn't consider all the factors mentioned above.
