{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. I need to look at all the events together and make a single classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" Then, provide a concise justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. Each JSON object represents an event where a file was created by the process named \"git.exe.\" The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" which indicates that a new file was made on the system. The file paths are all within a user directory, specifically under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different filenames like \"findLastFrom.d.ts,\" \"findLastIndex.d.ts,\" and so on.\n\nMy first thought is that these events are related to the Git version control system, which is commonly used in software development. The fact that all processes are named \"git.exe\" suggests that this is normal activity when working with Git repositories. Each event creates a file under the node_modules directory, which is typical for JavaScript or Node.js projects, especially when using tools like Cypress for testing.\n\nI notice that each file path ends with \".d.ts,\" which I recognize as a TypeScript declaration file. These files are standard in TypeScript projects and don't pose any immediate security risks. They're part of the project's structure and are created during development activities.\n\nConsidering the user context, \"fiddelis\" is likely the username of someone working on their own projects. The directory path includes \"S206 - Qualidade de Software,\" which sounds like a course or module related to software quality, possibly at an educational institution. This reinforces the idea that these are development activities rather than anything malicious.\n\nNow, looking for any red flags: all events are from the same process and user, occurring in a predictable part of the filesystem. There's no indication of unusual access patterns, such as multiple failed login attempts or writes to unexpected locations. The file creation tasks don't involve any executable or script files; they're purely type declaration files.\n\nI also consider that sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools like Git for malicious purposes, but in this case, the activity seems consistent with normal software development. There's no evidence of file sizes being unusually large (which could indicate steganography or hidden data), no changes to system files, and no network connections being established in these events.\n\nAdditionally, the repetition of similar file creation events under the same directory suggests a script or build process running during development. This is common when setting up projects or updating dependencies, especially with tools like npm or yarn that manage package installations and often create multiple files as part of their setup.\n\nThe timestamps (though not provided here) would be another factor, but assuming they are sequential and within a short period, it aligns with a build process rather than spread-out malicious activity. If these events were spaced out over time, it might raise more questions, but the batch nature suggests a single development action.\n\nIn terms of confidence, since all indicators point towards legitimate development activities without any signs of compromise or suspicious behavior, I'm very confident in classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** NOT INTERESTING  \n**Justification:** The events represent normal file creation activity by the Git process during software development. All files are within expected directories and related to TypeScript declarations, indicating typical development work rather than malicious behavior.  \n**Confidence Score:** 0.95"}

The files are TypeScript definition files related to lodash functions like isBoolean, isBuffer, etc. This looks like part of a project setup or during development when node modules are being installed or updated.\n\nSince all events are from the same process and involve creating multiple files in a standard location for a development environment (node_modules), this seems normal. Git.exe might be involved in cloning or updating repositories where these files are part of the Cypress types for lodash utility functions.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like file deletions, access to sensitive areas, or unusual process names. It's just standard file creation during development setup.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with some information about a file being created by the git.exe process.\n\nFirst off, each event has three main components: process details, Windows log info, and file path information. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git operations. The Windows log indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called FileCreate. The file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project, specifically under the lodash fp types directory.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they have names like isNumber.d.ts, isObject.d.ts, and so on. These seem to be TypeScript definition files for various utility functions from Lodash's functional programming (fp) module. The fact that multiple such files are being created in quick succession makes me think this is part of a larger process.\n\nNow, considering Git's behavior, when you clone a repository or perform operations like checkout or pull, Git often interacts with the file system to create directories and files. In this case, it looks like Git is setting up the project's dependencies, specifically the Cypress types for Lodash utilities. This is normal during development setups or when initializing a new project.\n\nThe timestamps on these events are probably very close together since they're part of the same operation. The repetition of the same process name and similar file paths reinforces that this isn't malicious activity but rather standard build or setup processes. There's no indication of any unusual behavior, such as files being created in unexpected locations or permissions being altered.\n\nI should also consider whether creating multiple files in a node_modules directory could be indicative of something suspicious. However, given the context—node_modules is a common directory for JavaScript\/TypeScript dependencies—and the fact that these are type definition files, it's unlikely to be malicious. Attackers usually look to hide their activities or modify existing files rather than create numerous standard files in expected locations.\n\nAnother angle is whether Git.exe being involved raises any red flags. While Git can be used for malicious purposes, such as transferring data exfiltration, the activity here doesn't show any signs of that. It's purely about file creation related to project setup.\n\nIn summary, all these events fit the pattern of normal development activities where a project is being initialized or dependencies are being installed. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious behaviors. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by git.exe in the node_modules directory, which is normal during project setup or dependency installations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what the events look like.\n\nEach event has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe\". The \"winlog\" task is about a file being created, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files are all in different paths within a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash types. So each line shows that git.exe created a specific .d.ts file.\n\nI know that node_modules can be quite large and contain a lot of third-party libraries, so it's normal for files to be created there during the setup or updates of a project. The fact that git is involved might mean it's part of a version control process, perhaps during a clone or fetch operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with \".d.ts\", which are TypeScript declaration files. These are typically generated and shouldn't pose any security risk on their own. Since all events show similar patterns—same process name, same task, and same type of file—it doesn't seem like there's any unusual behavior here.\n\nNo signs of anomalies like unexpected processes, access to sensitive files, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate a breach.

The first thing I notice is that every event has the same structure: it mentions \"git.exe\" as the process name, the task is \"File created\", and the file path points to various .d.ts files in a node_modules directory.\n\nLet me break this down. \"git.exe\" is commonly used for version control, especially in JavaScript or Node.js projects. The fact that multiple files are being created under \"node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\" suggests that someone is working on a project using Cypress and Lodash. These are legitimate tools, so seeing their types files being created isn't unusual.\n\nI'm checking the file paths to see if there's anything suspicious. All of them end with \".d.ts\", which I know are TypeScript declaration files. They're standard in projects that use TypeScript, so this activity is part of normal development processes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the repetition: 18 events all related to creating these .d.ts files. If someone was maliciously trying to create files, they might do it under different directories or with varying file names to avoid detection. Here, everything is consistent and within expected project structures.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether \"git.exe\" could be involved in any malicious activities. While possible, in this context, it seems more likely that the user is just cloning a repository or performing a git operation that's part of their workflow, like installing dependencies with npm or yarn, which would create these type definition files.\n\nI don't see any red flags like access to sensitive directories, creation of unexpected files, or unusual timestamps. The paths are all within a user's Downloads folder under an educational institution's directory (\"inatel\"), which adds to the legitimacy since it might be a student working on their project.\n\nSo, considering all these factors—the consistent process name, the nature of the task as file creation, and the specific file types and locations—it doesn't seem like this batch indicates any malicious activity.

I'm presented with a batch of events in JSONL format, each describing an event where the process name is \"git.exe\", and it's related to file creation under a specific path. The task is to determine whether this batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each event represents. Each line shows that git.exe created a new file. Looking at the file paths, they all point to \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\", with various .d.ts files being created. These are TypeScript declaration files for Lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nNow, considering the source of these events: git.exe is typically used for version control, especially in development environments. When developers work on projects using tools like npm or yarn, they might clone repositories which include node_modules. The creation of multiple .d.ts files under node_modules suggests that this could be part of a build process or an install step where dependencies are being set up.\n\nI need to assess if these events indicate malicious activity. Since the process is git.exe and it's creating standard files in a typical project structure, there's nothing inherently suspicious here. It doesn't involve any known indicators of compromise (IoCs) like execution from temporary directories or unusual file hashes.\n\nHowever, I should consider the context of the user and environment. If this activity occurs on a system where such development tools aren't usually installed, it might raise an eyebrow. But based solely on the given events without additional context, there's no evidence of misuse.\n\nAnother angle is to check for consistency in timestamps and frequency. The events are sequential, each creating a file immediately after the previous one. This aligns with how git operations or build processes work when setting up dependencies, so it doesn't seem anomalous.\n\nI should also think about whether these files being created are expected. In a development environment, node_modules is a standard directory where third-party libraries are stored. The presence of .d.ts files indicates TypeScript support, which is common in modern JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nThere's no indication of file deletions or other suspicious actions following the creation events. If there were attempts to execute these files or modify system configurations afterward, that would be more concerning, but such information isn't present here.\n\nAdditionally, considering the user account under which git.exe is running could provide context. If it's a legitimate development user, this activity is normal. Without knowing who initiated the process, though, I can't make definitive assumptions.\n\nIn summary, each event describes normal file creation during what appears to be a standard software development setup.

Let me look through each event and see what's going on.\n\nEach line starts with a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all the events have \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}}. That tells me the process involved here is git.exe, which is Git for Windows. Git is commonly used for version control, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual.\n\nNext, looking at the \"winlog\" field, each event has the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So these are all file creation events. The files being created have paths like \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\*.d.ts\". Breaking down the path, it's under a user's Downloads folder, in a directory named after a course (\"S206 - Qualidade de Software\"). Inside that, there's node_modules, which is typical for Node.js projects. Cypress is a testing framework, so node_modules makes sense here.\n\nEach file has a .d.ts extension, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are metadata files used by TypeScript to provide type information for JavaScript libraries. It seems like Git is creating multiple .d.ts files in the cypress types directory.\n\nSo, considering all these events together: same process (git.exe), same task (file creation), and file paths that fit into a standard development environment using Node.js and TypeScript. This looks normal when someone is working on a project that involves setting up or updating their development tools, especially if they're cloning a repository or restoring dependencies.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. There's no indication of unusual access times, file names outside the expected scope, or other anomalies that might suggest malicious activity. All the files are part of what you'd expect in a node_modules directory, and Git being involved with file creation is standard during initial setup or updates.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation. It's just normal file creation events related to a developer's environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup and not indicative of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All the events are similar: each one is an event where a file was created by the process \"git.exe\" in specific paths under the node_modules folder for Cypress and Lodash.\n\nFirst off, git.exe creating files sounds normal because when you're working with version control systems like Git, it's common to have scripts or tools run during development. The files listed here are all .d.ts files, which I know are TypeScript declaration files. These are typically generated by tools like TSLint or maybe part of the build process for projects using TypeScript.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under node_modules, specifically for Cypress and Lodash. That makes sense because when you install npm packages, their types and declarations get placed there. So, if someone is setting up a project with these tools, it's expected that Git might be creating or updating these files as part of the setup process.\n\nI'm thinking about whether this activity is unusual. Since all events are related to file creation by git.exe in a standard location for development dependencies, I don't see any red flags. No signs of executable files being created, no writes to unexpected directories, and nothing that stands out as malicious behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the user context—these logs come from a system where someone is likely working on software development. So, it's completely normal for Git to be interacting with node_modules as part of installing or updating packages.\n\nTo sum up, there's no indication of anything suspicious here. It looks like standard development activity, so I don't think this batch warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during the setup or update of node_modules for a Cypress project, which is expected in a development environment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All these paths are under node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash, which seems related to development tools—specifically, Cypress testing framework and lodash utilities.\n\nI need to consider whether this activity is normal or suspicious. Developers using tools like Git for version control often create files during installations or updates. Since all events are file creations by git.exe in a typical project structure, it looks routine.\n\nNo anomalies stand out, like unexpected locations, multiple failed attempts, or access to sensitive areas. It's consistent with standard development processes, so there's no red flag here.\n\nTherefore, the batch isn't interesting from a security perspective. The justification is that these are normal file creations during tool setup.

Each event is a JSON object with details about what happened on the system. The first thing that stands out to me is that all these events are coming from \"git.exe\". That's the Git command-line tool, which is commonly used for version control and software development. \n\nNext, each event has a task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that Git is creating some files on the system. The file paths show they're all in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. These are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts), which makes sense because Git often deals with such files, especially when managing project dependencies.\n\nLooking at the file names, they're all related to lodash functions—like isSymbol, isTypedArray, and so on. Lodash is a utility library in JavaScript\/TypeScript that provides various helper functions for common tasks. So, these are just type definitions for those utilities. \n\nI'm considering whether this activity is normal or unusual. Since Git is being used to create files in the node_modules directory, which is standard when installing or updating Node.js packages, this seems like routine behavior during development or deployment. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or indicative of unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also consistency across all events: same process name, same task type, and similar file paths. This repetition suggests it's part of a normal software build or update process rather than something like a script trying to create multiple files quickly for nefarious purposes.\n\nI don't see any signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access attempts, or other red flags in these logs. They all fit the pattern of legitimate Git operations during development activities.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same source, same task, normal file creation related to a project's dependencies.

Each event also has a file path pointing to different .d.ts files inside a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nSo, these events are about Git creating several TypeScript declaration files (the .d.ts extensions) within the Cypress types folder. Since this is part of the node_modules directory, it's likely during a development setup or an update of the project dependencies. The fact that multiple files are being created by git.exe in sequence suggests it's part of the build process for the project.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. Creating files during normal operations, especially in a development environment, is expected. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown processes, or attempts to access sensitive files.

These are all method names from lodash, a popular JavaScript library that provides utility functions. It's common for projects using Cypress (a testing framework) to include lodash types in their node_modules.\n\nThe fact that all these files are being created by git.exe suggests that this is part of the version control process.
