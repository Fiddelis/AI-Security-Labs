{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nStarting with the first event: It's the process 'powershell.exe' accessing something via ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that might be a red flag. But I'll need to see more events to get context.\n\nThe second event is whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is typically used to check user information. It's usually not malicious on its own, but if it's part of a larger sequence, it could be an indicator. Here, it's just a standalone process without any unusual activity, so maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nThird event again shows powershell.exe accessing something. This repetition is notable. If PowerShell is being accessed multiple times in quick succession, especially with different commands each time, that might suggest scripting or automationâ€”something attackers often use.\n\nThe fourth entry is svchost.exe interacting with the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate Windows process used by services, but it's also commonly exploited because many services run under this name. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so I should keep an eye on that.\n\nFifth event again has powershell.exe accessing the registry. So now we have multiple instances where PowerShell is interacting with system components like processes and the registry. That could indicate command execution or setting up persistence.\n\nThe sixth event stands out because it's a more detailed command line for powershell.exe. The script is adding a type from System.Windows.Forms, creating a bitmap of the screen, and saving it as an image in TEMP. This looks like screen capturing functionality, which is often used by malware to grab sensitive information or for ransomware purposes. That definitely raises the suspicion level.\n\nLooking at events 7 through 13, they continue with powershell.exe accessing various images and processes. The repeated use of PowerShell without clear legitimate context (like administration tasks) is concerning. Also, each event shows different modules being loaded (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc.), which could be part of executing malicious scripts or payload delivery.\n\nThe last four events again have complex command lines for powershell.exe, each capturing the screen and saving images to TEMP with slightly varying filenames. This repetition suggests automated behavior, possibly part of a script that runs multiple times to capture different parts of the screen or at different intervals.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts with system access capabilities, including registry modifications and screen captures. These activities don't align with typical user behavior and could indicate malicious intent such as persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or malware activity. The repetitive nature and specific actions (screen capture) are strong indicators that this is not normal operation but potentially an attack.\n\nTherefore, I would rate this batch of logs as highly indicative of potential cybersecurity issues. Further investigation is needed to determine if these activities are authorized or part of an ongoing compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a series of actions by the `powershell.exe` process that raise significant security concerns. These include multiple instances of PowerShell accessing system components like processes and the registry, which can be indicative of malicious activity such as command execution or persistence mechanisms. Notably, the script in one event captures the screen and saves it to TEMP, a common tactic in malware for data exfiltration.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Interest Level:** High\n- **Recommendation:** Investigate further to determine if these activities are authorized or part of an unauthorized access attempt. Monitoring for additional suspicious behavior is advised.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of logs indicates potential malicious activity involving PowerShell and screen capture. Therefore, the events are highly interesting for cybersecurity investigation.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes running with command lines that involve capturing the screen and saving images to the TEMP directory. The command lines are using Add-Type from System.Windows.Forms, which suggests they're taking screenshots. This is a bit concerning because taking screenshots can be part of data exfiltration or surveillance activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, these events happen multiple times with slightly different filenames like estrutura_ativo.png, modulo_principal.png, etc. The fact that there are several such files created in quick succession makes me think this might be part of a script that's capturing multiple parts of the screen. It could be malicious, but it's also possible it's some automated tool or legitimate script doing screenshot captures.\n\nThen, I see events where a file is created and then deleted by PowerShell.exe. Specifically, there's a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 followed by a FileDeleteDetected event. This behavior is a bit suspicious because deleting files you create can be an attempt to clean up evidence of malicious activity. It might indicate that something was run and then the script was removed to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a RegistryEvent where powershell.exe sets a registry value, which could be modifying system configurations or persistence mechanisms. This is another red flag because attackers often use registry modifications for persistence so their malware sticks around after reboots.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events related to remote command execution and pipeline execution. These tasks like 'Execute a Remote Command' and 'Executing Pipeline' can indicate that commands are being run over a network or in a way that's not straightforward, which is often seen in attack chains.\n\nOther processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe modifying files and registry values might be part of legitimate operations, but given the context with powershell.exe activities, they could also be components of an attack. For example, conhost.exe is often used as a host for scripts and can sometimes be exploited in attacks.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and modifies the registry. While Chrome doing these things might not be unusual, it's worth monitoring to ensure there's no compromise or extension activities happening without proper permissions.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of PowerShell with screen capture commands, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and remote command executions stand out as potentially malicious behaviors. These actions don't seem to align with normal user activity and could be indicators of a cyberattack, such as data theft or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards marking this batch as interesting for further investigation because the combination of these events suggests possible malicious intent. The multiple screen captures, file operations, and registry changes by PowerShell.exe are particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple Screen Captures:** PowerShell.exe processes capture screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory. This behavior is suspicious as it could be used for surveillance or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion:** A script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1) is created and then deleted, possibly to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:** Powershell.exe sets registry values, a common tactic for persistence in malware attacks.\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution:** Events indicate remote command execution and pipeline activities, often seen in attack chains.\n\n5. **Other Processes:** Conhost.exe and chrome.exe exhibit unusual behavior, potentially indicating exploitation or unauthorized access.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these events strongly suggests potential malicious activity, particularly concerning the use of PowerShell for screen captures, file operations, and registry modifications. This batch is deemed interesting for further investigation to assess the risk and determine if a cyberattack has occurred."}

That alone isn't suspicious because Chrome is a common process and logs various activities. But looking closer at the tasks being logged:\n\n- Most events are about \"Registry value set\" which seems normal for application operations.\n- There's one DNS query, which could be part of standard browsing behavior.\n- Two image load events: one for \"amsi.dll\", which is a legitimate Windows anti-malware scan interface, and another for \"MpOAV.dll\", used by Windows Defender. This indicates Chrome is loading these system files, which is expected.\n\nGiven that all activities align with typical operations of the Chrome browser without any signs of unusual behavior or deviations from baseline, I classify this batch as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated normal activities from chrome.exe such as registry modifications and loading system files, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
