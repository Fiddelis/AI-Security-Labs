{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The logs provided contain a mix of process information, Windows event tasks, and file paths. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n1. **Process Information**:\n   - Several processes are listed, including `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. These are common system processes that are typically part of Windows operations.\n   - Notably, there are entries where `process` is set to `None`, indicating no active process was detected.\n\n2. **Windows Event Logs (winlog)**:\n   - The logs include tasks such as \"Process Create,\" \"Registry value set,\" and \"Image loaded.\" These are standard events that occur during system operations.\n   - There are entries where the task is described as \"Windows Update Agent\" and \"None,\" which might indicate background processes or system updates.\n\n3. **File Information**:\n   - A file path is provided for `taskschd.dll`, which is a legitimate Windows system file related to Task Scheduler.\n   - In one entry, there's an attempt to create a new service named `\"objeto_ativo\"` using `powershell.exe` with the command line:\n     ```powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n     This suggests that an external script is being executed to create and start a new service on the system.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The repeated entries of creating the `objeto_ativo` service might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code on the system.\n   - The file path in the command line (`C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`) could be a location where malicious software is being stored and executed.\n\n5. **Recommendations**:\n   - If this activity is not authorized or expected, it could indicate potential unauthorized access or malware on the system.\n   - It's advisable to investigate the origin of the `objeto_ativo` service and the file path mentioned in the command line.\n   - Running antivirus scans and monitoring for unusual process activity would be prudent steps to ensure system security.\n\nIn summary, while some entries are normal Windows operations, others may warrant further investigation to ensure there is no unauthorized or malicious activity on the system."}
