{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a DNS query from chrome.exe. That seems normal since browsers do that regularly. Next, PowerShell is setting a registry value—could be benign or malicious, but I need more context.\n\nThen, cmd.exe runs systeminfo and reg query. Systeminfo is often used to gather system info, which can be part of reconnaissance. The reg query on HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum might indicate someone trying to list disk drives, possibly looking for removable devices or external storage.\n\nAnother PowerShell event accessing a process—maybe it's using reflection or another technique. Then cmd.exe setting another registry value, which is similar to the earlier one but not immediately concerning on its own.\n\nsysteminfo.exe creates and loads some DLLs. AMSI.DLL is related to antivirus, so that's standard. MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender also normal. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—nothing unusual there.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is created with a command line mentioning wbem and embedding. That process is legitimate but often targeted by malware for its WMI access capabilities. The image load of wmiutils.dll seems standard.\n\nsvchost.exe creating files in winevt\/Logs, which are log files, so that's normal. It also sets registry values again—could be part of service configuration.\n\nReg.exe querying the same HKLM path as before. That's another sign of someone checking disk information. cmd.exe and conhost.exe doing similar actions add to the pattern.\n\nServices.exe logon is standard for system services. The special logon event might indicate a service or system process starting.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating its config file—expected behavior from monitoring tools.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and more PowerShell events don't stand out on their own, but combined with others, they add to the context.\n\nChrome.exe creating a pipe and setting registry values could be part of normal operation, though pipes can sometimes be used for interprocess communication which might be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (cmd.exe, reg.exe, PowerShell) accessing the same registry key related to disk drives. This pattern suggests potential unauthorized access or reconnaissance, possibly leading up to exfiltration or installation of malware. The use of systeminfo and WmiPrvSE adds to the concern as these can be tools for gathering info or persistence.\n\nI'm not sure if this indicates actual malicious activity yet, but the combination is enough to warrant closer investigation. So I'd classify it as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications, particularly involving 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', and 'reg.exe' accessing the same registry path related to disk drives. This pattern may indicate potential malicious activity such as reconnaissance or persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system logs to analyze. The user is asking me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. They want a single classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. There's also one event where Calculator.exe set a registry value, a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, and another file creation by powershell.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that Chrome is doing multiple RegistryEvent tasks. That could be normal since Chrome might update settings or extensions, but it's worth checking if this volume is unusual. The user mentioned extensive experience, so I'd think about whether repeated registry writes from the same process are common.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe writing to the registry. That seems a bit odd because I don't expect system tools like Calculator to make many registry changes. It might be a red flag, but it could also be legitimate if Calculator is updating some settings.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory doesn't seem suspicious; it's likely part of the data collection process. Powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' catches my eye because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and the filename seems arbitrary without context.\n\nPutting this together: multiple registry writes from Chrome might not be concerning on their own, but combined with Calculator's activity and the new file created by PowerShell, it raises some flags. There's a possibility of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these actions indicate malicious behavior, but there are enough anomalies to warrant closer investigation. So I'd classify this batch as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry value modifications by chrome.exe and Calculator.exe, combined with file creation events, suggest potential system configuration changes that may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
