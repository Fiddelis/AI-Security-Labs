{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from 'chrome.exe' with network connection and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that connects to the internet regularly.\n\nThen there are several entries related to 'powershell.exe'. The command lines show that PowerShell is starting other processes using batch files. This could be suspicious because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. \n\nLooking deeper, there's a file creation and deletion of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory. Creating and immediately deleting a script might be an attempt to avoid detection, which raises red flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry accesses and image loads by PowerShell. These actions could indicate that it's executing code or loading modules, which is common in malicious scripts to hide their presence or drop payloads.\n\nThe later entries show 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' accessing the registry, but this seems less concerning as it's a known Windows process used for running applications like those in the Start menu.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines and file operations suggests possible malicious activity. Therefore, the batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts and creating\/deleting files in Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Calculator.exe and several instances where powershell.exe is accessing the registry and loading images. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly exploited in attacks.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is setting registry values and loading various DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious, but repeated registry modifications could indicate something suspicious, especially if they're done by a script or batch file.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries with registry writes. Chrome often makes registry changes when updating settings or extensions, so that might be normal unless it's happening unusually frequently.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one event shows a command line that starts a PowerShell process to execute a .bat script. That's concerning because scripts can automate malicious activities. Additionally, there are cmd.exe processes executing batch files from specific paths like \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\...\" which could be indicators of malicious scripting or automated tasks.\n\nAnother event has conhost.exe modifying the registry. Conhost is typically used for hosting console windows and isn't usually associated with malicious activity on its own, but combined with other events, it might raise suspicion.\n\nThere are file creation events by powershell.exe creating a .txt file in the Downloads folder, which could be part of data exfiltration or log tampering. Similarly, svchost.exe creating a file in NetworkService's AppData might be normal but worth looking into since svchost is often used by legitimate services and malware.\n\nI also see multiple instances where different processes are accessing each other's processes (ProcessAccess), which could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement if done improperly. The ImageLoad events for system DLLs like amsi.dll don't seem suspicious on their own, but combined with other activities, they might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe high frequency of RegistryEvent tasks across multiple processes is notable. Legitimate software does modify the registry, but such extensive changes could signal configuration drift or malicious activity aiming to persistence.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activities. The use of powershell.exe with command-line scripts, multiple registry modifications, and file creations in user directories are red flags. These could be signs of script-based attacks, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe executing scripts, registry modifications across processes, and file creations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL format, there are eight events total. The first seven events all have \"process\" as chrome.exe setting a registry value, and no file involved. That seems repetitiveâ€”same process and same action over and over. I know that legitimate software like Chrome can make registry changes during updates or configuration, so this might be normal.\n\nThen the eighth event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file. That's also not unusual because log beaters often update their configurations. The ninth event shows powershell.exe creating a file named elemento_base.txt in the user's Downloads folder. Powershell can be malicious, but sometimes it's just used for legitimate tasks.\n\nPutting it all together: seven registry writes by Chrome and two file creations from other processes. Nothing stands out as overtly suspicious. No signs of privilege escalation, unusual files created, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force. So, I think the batch isn't particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist primarily of repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe and a few file creation events from standard processes. These actions do not indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
