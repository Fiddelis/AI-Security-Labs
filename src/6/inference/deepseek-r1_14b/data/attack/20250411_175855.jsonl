{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event from MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That might be normal since it's part of the antivirus service, but I should keep that in mind.\n\nThen, multiple chrome.exe processes are showing network connections and DNS queries. Browsers do make a lot of network requests and DNS lookups, so these could just be regular browsing activities. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe entries with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so I need to look deeper into what they're doing. The command lines aren't provided here, but repeated accesses to the registry might indicate something fishy, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nI see whoami.exe being executed without any arguments—it's a simple command that usually just returns the user information. Not a red flag by itself, unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe instances with specific commands. The first one is 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key | findstr \/e .key'. That looks like it's searching for files ending with .key in the root directory C:. This could be an attempt to locate configuration or key files, possibly related to credential theft.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command is '\/S \/D \/c \"dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key\"', which again seems to be searching for .key files. Combining this with the whoami and powershell activities might indicate someone trying to gather information or steal credentials.\n\nThere's a findstr.exe event looking for .key, which further supports the idea of searching for sensitive files. This could be part of data exfiltration or compromise.\n\nLooking at other events: winlogbeat.exe creating files seems normal if it's an agent running. The creation of tarefa_geral.txt by powershell might just be a log file, but without context, it's hard to tell. Notedomain.txt being created could relate to domain credentials storage.\n\nRegistry modifications from various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe are concerning because attackers often modify the registry for persistence or other malicious activities. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate an attacker tweaking system settings.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing the registry is unusual but not impossible; maybe it's a script or macro doing something unexpected. Still, it's worth noting.\n\nLastly, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal since it's a known DLL for URL handling in Windows applications.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of searching for .key files with command-line tools, combined with registry modifications and powershell access, suggest potential malicious activity aimed at gathering credentials or system information. The repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell without clear legitimate context adds to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential data exfiltration attempts and suspicious process activities, such as repeated searches for .key files and registry modifications.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 70\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through each one to see if there's anything unusual.\n\nThe first event is svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since svchost runs services and often interacts with the registry. Next, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds typical too; those are standard processes and files.\n\nThen again, svchost.exe sets another registry value—nothing out of place there. Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its directory is expected as it's part of log shipping. ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value isn't unusual either; it's part of the Windows shell.\n\nNow, Calculator.exe setting a registry value again seems normal too. The first PowerShell event where it sets a registry value catches my eye because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be malicious. However, sometimes legitimate scripts use it, so I'll keep an eye out for more events involving powershell.exe.\n\nThe next event has powershell.exe accessing something—maybe checking or modifying another process. That's a bit concerning. Then, Chrome.exe creating a pipe could be normal, but registry writes by Chrome might indicate some extension or script activity. However, most of these seem within normal bounds since Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings.\n\nMultiple registry writes from Chrome don't raise red flags immediately, though frequent changes might hint at something. The image loads in Chrome for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are standard system files used by Windows Defender and similar tools, so that's normal.\n\nLooking back, there are several instances of powershell.exe accessing processes. That could be an indicator of potential malicious activity, especially if combined with other actions. However, without seeing more malicious commands or behaviors, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI also notice whoami.exe being run, which is a common tool to check user permissions. Unless it's used in a way that escalates privileges, it's probably not an issue here.\n\nConsidering all events together, the significant point is the multiple actions involving powershell.exe accessing processes. This could be an attempt at process injection or lateral movement. While some of these might be legitimate admin tasks, others could indicate malicious intent. The high number of registry writes from different processes, especially Chrome and svchost.exe, might not necessarily be suspicious on their own but combined with the PowerShell activity could warrant closer investigation.\n\nSo, overall, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because of the potential misuse of PowerShell and multiple registry modifications that might indicate persistence or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving svchost.exe and powershell.exe setting registry values, which could indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, the use of whoami.exe and multiple registry modifications from different processes warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
