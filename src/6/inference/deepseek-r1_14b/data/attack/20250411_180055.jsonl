{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me start by analyzing each event individually and then consider the overall pattern.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve Compress-Archive. This suggests some script execution within PowerShell. The parameters include paths like \"C:\\modulo_temporario\\objeto_principal\\unidade_secundario\\bin\\entrada_logico\" and destination paths in the TEMP directory, ending with .zip files. While using Compress-Archive isn't inherently malicious, it's often used in attacks for bundling or extracting files.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess) and writes to the registry (RegistryEvent). Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers might create persistence mechanisms by adding entries. Additionally, the file operations include creating temporary PowerShell scripts (__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1), which are then deleted shortly after. This behavior could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or test script execution policies.\n\nLooking further, there are events with command lines that reference different directories and files, all pointing to various modules and packages in the system. The consistent use of $env:TEMP for destination paths might be a sign of trying to avoid detection by keeping files in temporary locations which could be cleared later.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's monitoring or managing system components, potentially for malicious activities like persistence or lateral movement.\n\nThe events where powershell.exe creates pipes (Pipe Created) are also notable. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which could be part of command and control mechanisms or to hide malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows extensive use of PowerShell with suspicious scripting patterns, file operations in temporary directories, registry modifications, and repeated Compress-Archive commands. These behaviors collectively suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent, possibly related to script execution, data exfiltration, or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing scripts with Compress-Archive and modifying registry.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line seems to be an event with process information, Windows log details, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines show Compress-Archive being used, which is a common cmdlet for creating zip files. But in the context of an attack, compressing files could be part of data exfiltration or setting up malicious scripts.\n\nLooking deeper into these powershell.exe events, I see they're executing Compress-Archive with different paths and destinations in the TEMP directory. That's a bit suspicious because attackers often use such techniques to package files for later transmission. Also, the destination paths are using environment variables like $env:TEMP, which is a common tactic to avoid static file paths that might be monitored.\n\nAnother point of interest is the registry value sets by powershell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe and Calculator.exe. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. For example, an attacker might set registry keys to enable services or modify run keys for persistence.\n\nThere are also ImageLoad events for various DLLs and EXEs. While this is normal, some of the paths, like MpClient.dll under Windows Defender, could be a way to load malicious code if that file has been tampered with.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in specific paths might indicate log tampering or data collection by an attacker using legitimate tools for malicious purposes. Additionally, processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values are concerning because these are typically system processes; their involvement could signal process injection or other adversarial activities.\n\nI also notice that several events involve different EXEs (like Calculator.exe, chrome.exe) performing actions they shouldn't be doing, such as setting registry values. This could suggest process hollowing or the use of legitimate binaries for malicious operations.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a pattern of multiple processes modifying the system in ways that are unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity. The combination of powershell.exe command execution, file compression, registry modifications across various processes, and unexpected actions by common executables all point towards possible attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs show multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands, registry modifications by unusual processes, and unexpected actions from common executables like Calculator.exe. These indicate potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION_DETAIL\": \"1. **powershell.exe Activities**: Multiple events involve powershell.exe executing `Compress-Archive` with different paths, suggesting possible data packaging for exfiltration.\\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Registry value sets by various processes like conhost.exe and Calculator.exe could indicate persistence or privilege escalation attempts.\\n3. **Unexpected EXE Actions**: Common executables like Calculator.exe performing registry operations are unusual and may suggest malicious activities such as process injection or persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first seven entries are all from chrome.exe, with tasks indicating registry value sets. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings, so this alone doesn't raise red flags unless it's unusual activity. But these seem repetitive and within normal operations.\n\nNext, there's an event where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll. AMSI is related to antivirus scanning, so that's a common process when applications interact with security components. No issue here.\n\nThen, chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Again, this seems like standard behavior as it's part of the defender toolkit. Not suspicious.\n\nAnother event in chrome.exe setting a registry value, which again fits normal operation.\n\nNow, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so it making changes to its own configuration files is expected during setup or updates. The path seems legitimate too.\n\nThen, two events with powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, but without specific malicious commands or indicators, this could be benign admin activity.\n\nLastly, whoami.exe being executed. This is a standard tool for checking user permissions, often used during system audits or troubleshooting. It's not unusual on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are normal system processes—browsers accessing registry settings and security-related DLLs, log management tools updating configs, and common utilities like PowerShell and whoami.exe being used. There’s no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious scripts, or signs of data exfiltration or privilege escalation. The repetition might indicate a script running multiple times, but without context, it's hard to say if that's bad.\n\nI don't see any red flags like failed logins, unexpected file accesses, or processes running with elevated privileges. All the files and tasks involved are within expected bounds for these processes. Therefore, while monitoring each event individually is good practice, as a whole, this batch doesn't show signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as Chrome registry modifications, legitimate file loads, and standard log management tool configurations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
