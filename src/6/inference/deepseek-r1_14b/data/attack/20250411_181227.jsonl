{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first six events all involve powershell.exe running a command-line script. The command line shows the creation of scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. Each one has a different task name, like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"registro_geral\". This looks suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\Administrators) at logon could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThe next few events also involve powershell.exe but without command-line details in some cases. There are registry value sets, process accesses, and image loads. These might indicate that the script is interacting with the system's configuration or loading additional modules, which can be signs of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and writes to the registry. While this isn't immediately alarming on its own, it could be part of legitimate operations. However, considering the other events involving powershell.exe, I should keep an eye out for any anomalies related to these processes.\n\nThe confidence here is high because multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with administrative rights are red flags. These activities often don't happen in normal system operations and could be indicators of a potential attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe loading an image file. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it's not always bad. Then there are several events where files are created and deleted in the Temp directory. Creating temporary files isn't unusual, especially with scripts, but deleting them quickly could be a sign of trying to remove traces.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe again with a command line that creates a scheduled task. The action is calc.exe, which seems harmless, but using AtLogon and targeting Administrators with the highest run level raises red flags. This might be an attempt to persist malicious activity upon login by a privileged user.\n\nAfter that, chrome.exe has multiple registry writes. While Chrome does modify the registry for updates or settings, many such events in a row could indicate something is off, like potential tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's a series of events labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This seems concerning because executing remote commands can be part of command-and-control activities, which are often malicious. The fact that these events don't have associated processes or files makes them even more suspiciousâ€”attackers might try to cover their tracks by not writing to logs with process info.\n\nLooking at the last event again, it's another powershell.exe creating a scheduled task similar to an earlier one but with a different name this time. This duplication could be testing persistence or trying to avoid detection by varying names each time.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple signs of potential malicious activity: PowerShell creating suspicious scheduled tasks, remote command executions without context, and repeated attempts that might indicate testing or lateral movement within the system. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior and could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution attempting to create a scheduled task that executes calc.exe, which is often used in malicious scripts. There are also numerous remote command executions and registry modifications that could indicate potential unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst up is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal since it's related to Windows Management Instrumentation. Then there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so these might just be standard operations.\n\nNext, I see another svchost creating a file in the Tasks directory. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. There's an event where no process is listed but it mentions executing a remote command. That catches my attention because without knowing what's triggering it, remote commands can be malicious.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe events: some creating files and others setting registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so multiple instances might indicate something fishy. Also, the fact that they're creating files in user directories could be part of lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nConhost.exe and chrome.exe also show up with registry changes and image loads. Conhost is usually harmless, but paired with other events, it's worth monitoring. Chrome loading various DLLs isn't unusual, but multiple Registry writes from the same process might raise a flag.\n\nThere are multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values repeatedly. That behavior could be part of an exploit or persistence mechanism, especially if done in quick succession.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, it's likely legitimate since it's an ELK component. However, if the paths look off or there are too many such events, it might warrant closer inspection.\n\nPowershell.exe creating multiple text files in the Downloads folder is concerning. Attackers often use this to store data for exfiltration. Having two such files, entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt, could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these together: suspicious process names (powershell.exe), repeated registry writes that might indicate persistence or lateral movement, file creation in user directories which could be for storing stolen data, and remote command execution without a known process. These patterns suggest possible attacker activities such as establishing persistence, data collection, or preparing for exfiltration.\n\nI'm not seeing any clear indicators of an active breach yet, but the combination of these events is enough to raise my confidence that this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, remote command execution without a known process, and file creation by powershell.exe in user directories which could indicate malicious behavior or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
