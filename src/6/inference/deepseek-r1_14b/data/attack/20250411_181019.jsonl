{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what they tell me.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of process creations and accesses, especially with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. For instance, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed and cmd.exe is used to create services like win32times. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell and command-line tools are often used by attackers for executing commands and creating malicious processes.\n\nLooking deeper, I see commands like \"sc create\" which is used to register new Windows services. The script paths mentioned in the command lines don't exist, as indicated by the filenames ending with \"_NonExistingScript.ps1\". That's a red flag because legitimate scripts usually have existing file paths. This suggests that these commands are trying to execute non-existent files, possibly as part of a payload delivery or execution.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of services.exe and svchost.exe creating registry entries. These processes are often involved in service-related activities, but when combined with other suspicious behaviors like multiple process creations and registry changes, it raises concerns about potential malware installation or configuration.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created by winlogbeat.exe. While this could be normal for log management tools, the specific path seems unusual (a .winlogbeat.yml.new file in user Downloads), but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThe use of RuntimeBroker.exe accessing registry values and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are also worth noting. These might seem benign, but when combined with other activities, they could be part of a broader attack vector, likeDLL injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, the batch has multiple instances of creating non-existent scripts through command-line tools, accessing PowerShell, and modifying registry entries—behaviors that are often indicative of malicious activity. While some events might be legitimate, the combination points towards possible investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and accesses related to potentially malicious activities, such as creating non-existent scripts via cmd.exe and sc.exe, repeated registry modifications, and suspicious use of PowerShell. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a set of JSONL logs, each with some process information and Windows log tasks.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That's repetitive—nine times in a row. Then there are two more events from chrome.exe about image loading, which seems normal because Chrome often loads various system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those don't raise any red flags.\n\nThen I see an entry for 'powershell.exe' accessing something via ProcessAccess rule. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be suspicious. But in this case, the task is 'Process accessed', which might just mean it's interacting with another process, not necessarily doing anything harmful.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome, but that's usual. The image loads are standard as well. The PowerShell event stands out a bit, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. Since there's no indication of unusual file access or other signs like failed logins or network communications, I wouldn't classify this batch as particularly interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist mainly of normal Chrome activities (registry modifications and loading system DLLs) with a single PowerShell process access event that lacks additional context suggesting malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
