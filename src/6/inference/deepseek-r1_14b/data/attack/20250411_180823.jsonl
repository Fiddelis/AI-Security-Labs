{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connection and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do that regularly when browsing the web. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe making registry changes isn't unusual either. It's a legitimate Windows process often involved in handling runtime aspects of apps.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing the registry is also standard. Notepad doesn't typically do malicious things, so this is probably benign.\n\nPowershell.exe is interesting because it's commonly used for both legitimate tasks and by attackers. However, looking at the logs, it's just being accessed or created without any evident malicious command-line arguments. So, maybe not a red flag yet.\n\nThere are several calc.exe instances loading urlmon.dll. Wait, that's odd. Calc.exe is usually benign, but having multiple instances loading this DLL might be suspicious. Maybe an attempt to execute code or load something malicious?\n\nThen I see cmd.exe with command lines creating scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines have \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\", which seems like it's setting up tasks to run calc on startup or logon. That's concerning because creating multiple scheduled tasks to run a process could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThe schtasks.exe entries are creating these tasks, and the paths in the command lines point to calc.exe being executed. This repetition makes me think it's an attempt to create multiple backdoors or ensure persistence across reboots.\n\nsvchost.exe is involved in several registry writes and file creations under Task directory with names like \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\". svchost is a legitimate process, but unusual activity here might indicate something malicious. The filenames look suspiciously generic but could be part of a larger payload.\n\nConhost.exe also accessing the registry—conhost is another Windows process that's usually for console applications. Unusual behavior here might not be as immediately concerning but worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of cmd and schtasks creating scheduled tasks to run calc.exe, which itself loads an unusual DLL. The use of powershell.exe without clear benign activity and the svchost.exe registry\/file changes could indicate a potential malicious script or process trying to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code.\n\nI think this batch shows signs that could be part of a malware infection attempt. The repeated scheduled tasks are a common tactic for attackers to maintain access. While there's no direct evidence, the combination points towards something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple cmd.exe and schtasks.exe processes creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on startup\/logon suggest potential malicious activity for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe all showing tasks related to registry value sets. That's a bit unusual because these processes don't typically make frequent changes to the registry, especially not in quick succession. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThen there are a lot of events from chrome.exe. Most of them involve setting registry values or loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While some activities by Chrome are normal, seeing so many registry modifications might be suspicious because legitimate applications don't usually modify the registry that often, especially when it's a batch of 13 entries all doing similar things.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file named unidade_ativo.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used for malicious activities because it has scripting capabilities. Creating files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms. This combined with previous registry modifications could indicate something more serious.\n\nAnother red flag is whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is a legitimate system tool used to display user information, its execution in conjunction with other potentially suspicious activities might warrant closer inspection. Especially if it's run without a clear purpose or in an unexpected context.\n\nThe fact that many of these events are repetitive and involve multiple processes interacting with the registry and files suggests possible malicious behavior. Malware often uses registry modifications for persistence and file creation to store data or payloads.\n\nI also consider the possibility of legitimate activities, such as system updates or user scripts running Chrome extensions. However, the volume and combination of actions across different processes make it less likely to be just regular user activity. The use of powershell.exe and the creation of a file in the Downloads folder are particularly concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events could be normal, the overall pattern—especially involving multiple processes making registry changes, using PowerShell for file operations, and executing whoami.exe—is indicative of potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from different processes including svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe performing registry modifications, which are unusual activities for these processes.
