The first thing that catches my attention is the repeated use of PowerShell.exe with some command-line arguments. It looks like they're creating scheduled tasks. Specifically, the commands are setting up tasks to run calc.exe at logon, which seems suspicious because it's a common tool used in malicious scripts.\n\nThe events show multiple instances where PowerShell is being used to create these tasks under different names, like \"entrada_ativo\" and \"tarefa_geral\". This could indicate an attempt to persistence the system by adding tasks that will execute at logon. The fact that they're targeting the Administrators group with RunLevel Highest might be a red flag because it suggests high privileges are being used.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry modifications and file creations. For example, when svchost.exe creates a task named \"unidade_comum\", this could be an attempt to hide malicious activities or create backdoors. The repeated Registry value sets in chrome.exe are also unusual; while legitimate software can modify the registry, multiple such events from the same process might warrant investigation.\n\nAnother point is the file creations by PowerShell and svchost.exe. These files might be storing configurations or other malicious payloads. The fact that some files don't have paths typical for standard operations adds to the suspicion.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no associated process or file. This could mean that remote execution is occurring, possibly indicating an active attack where commands are being run over the network without leaving obvious traces on the local system.\n\nPutting it all together, these events—especially the scheduled tasks setup and the unusual file and registry changes—indicate potential malicious activity. The combination of high-privilege actions, task creation for persistence, and remote command executions points towards an attack vector that should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe processes creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first line has \"powershell.exe\" setting a registry value. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be malicious since it's powerful. The second is \"conhost.exe\", which I think is related to command prompts, doing the same registry thing. Then there's \"chrome.exe\" also setting a registry value multiple times—like four times in total. Also, chrome loaded some DLL file and did a DNS query.\n\nWait, so all these processes are writing to the registry. The first two could be normal if it's part of their setup or configuration. But seeing Chrome doing that repeatedly is odd because I don't recall Chrome usually modifying the registry much beyond its initial install.\n\nAlso, Chrome loading \"MpOAV.dll\" sounds suspicious. That DLL name doesn't ring a bell as something legitimate from Windows Defender, maybe? Or perhaps it's malicious trying to mimic defender tools.\n\nThe last event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file—probably part of log shipping, which isn't concerning unless there's something wrong with how it's configured.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes writing to the registry in quick succession could indicate some kind of script or tool running. The DLL loading might be an attempt at persistence or malicious activity. So, overall, this batch seems like it warrants a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes writing to the registry and Chrome loading a suspicious DLL suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
