{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several instances where Notepad.exe and Calculator.exe are involved in setting registry values. That seems a bit odd because these are usually benign applications. Why would Notepad be modifying the registry? Maybe it's part of some script or configuration change, but it could also indicate malicious activity trying to hide itself by using common tools.\n\nThen I notice multiple entries from PowerShell accessing processes and creating new ones. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The fact that it's being accessed several times might raise flags. Especially when combined with other events, like process creation of WMIC.exe and schtasks.exe. These are known tools for task scheduling and remote management, which attackers sometimes misuse to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command deleting Notepad.exe using wmic. That's concerning because it shows an attempt to remove a process from the system. Similarly, another cmd.exe is deleting a scheduled task with schtasks. These deletion attempts might be part of cleaning up traces after malicious activities or preventing detection.\n\nThere are also entries where svchost.exe and conhost.exe are modifying registry values. Svchost is a common host for Windows services, but it can be exploited by malware. Conhost.exe is typically related to command-line tools, so seeing it modify the registry might indicate some unusual activity.\n\nI see that whoami.exe was executed without any arguments. While whoami is usually harmless and used to display user information, its execution in certain contexts could be part of a reconnaissance phase during an attack.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll, which is related to the Anti-Malware Scan Interface. This might indicate that Chrome is triggering some anti-malware checks, but it's worth noting as it could interfere with other processes or be part of an attack vector.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm noticing several red flags: multiple process creations and deletions, use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for scripting, deletion of tasks and processes, and registry modifications. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior. While some events might have benign explanations, the combination suggests a coordinated effort that could be part of an attack chain.\n\nI'm concerned about the persistence mechanisms here. Deleting tasks with schtasks and using wmic to delete processes could be attempts to remove evidence or disable protective measures. The registry modifications might be setting up new keys for persistence or altering existing ones to hide malicious activities.\n\nThe confidence level is high because there are multiple suspicious events across different tools and processes, which makes it less likely that this is just normal system activity. Each individual event might not raise too many flags on its own, but the entire batch together paints a concerning picture.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process creations and deletions using tools like PowerShell and cmd.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where cmd.exe and chrome.exe are setting registry values. That's normal for some system operations or legitimate software installations. Not too concerning on their own.\n\nThen I notice several instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which could be part of legitimate script execution, but it can also be a way to gather information during an attack.\n\nThe real focus seems to be on powershell.exe. There are multiple events where PowerShell is accessing or setting registry values and loading images. This is significant because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities like executing commands, downloading files, or establishing persistence.\n\nLooking deeper, I see File Delete logged events in the logs. Specifically, there's a file being deleted from a temporary directory with a somewhat unusual filename ending in .ps1. Since PowerShell scripts can be malicious, deleting such a file could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt operations, which is a red flag.\n\nAnother point of interest are the File Create events related to configuration files and startup profiles for PowerShell. Malware might create or modify these files to ensure persistence across reboots, allowing them to execute on every login.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events, which can be used by malicious scripts to communicate with other processes or to exfiltrate data. Additionally, the repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in command lines suggests some form of script execution, possibly using ampersands to run multiple commands or execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe fact that several different PowerShell processes are accessing various DLLs and files could indicate either legitimate usage (like running scripts) or attempts to load malicious modules. The combination of these activities—registry modifications, file deletions, pipe creations, and repeated script executions—raises the suspicion of potential malicious behavior.\n\nWhile each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the pattern of multiple PowerShell processes engaging in diverse activities that don't clearly align with standard user or system operations suggests a need for closer examination. This could indicate an active attack, such as persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration attempts, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events together, there's enough concerning activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing registry modifications, file operations, and loading various DLLs.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I have a batch of 19 events to analyze. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that they're all PowerShell processes. That's a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities. Each event details different actions, such as command lines and file accesses.\n\nThe first event has a command line checking if a specific .bat file exists. If it does, the script exits; otherwise, it continues. This seems suspicious because it could be probing for signs of prior activity or attempting to avoid execution if certain files are present.\n\nThen there's a series of tasks related to image loading and registry events from Chrome.exe. While Chrome can have legitimate registry interactions, multiple such events in quick succession might indicate tampering, especially considering the other PowerShell activities.\n\nFurther down, another PowerShell command creates a new .bat file and writes content to it. This is concerning because creating scripts on the fly can be used to execute malicious commands later.\n\nI'm noticing that many of these events are related to process creation, image loading, and registry modifications—classic indicators of potentially malicious activity. The combination of multiple PowerShell processes with specific command-line arguments and file operations suggests possible script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the batch shows a pattern typical of attack behaviors: using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, checking for existing files to determine next steps, and creating new scripts on the filesystem. These actions together raise significant red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes with specific command-line arguments that check for the existence of certain .bat files and create new ones, which may indicate potential malicious activity or scripting behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve powershell.exe with command lines that create new items and set content in various .bat files. This seems a bit unusual because creating multiple script files could be part of malicious activity like dropping payloads or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is accessing processes and loading images, which can be normal but might also indicate suspicious behavior if these actions aren't typical for the user's environment.\n\nThere are some file creation events from winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log management. That doesn't seem concerning on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nA lot of these events involve powershell.exe accessing different files and registry entries. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for lateral movement and executing scripts, so repeated access could be a red flag.\n\nThe high number of events related to file creation and process access suggests potential script execution or file operations that might not be legitimate. The consistent use of specific paths across multiple events also raises suspicion as it might indicate a coordinated attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several indicators of potential malicious activity involving powershell.exe, which is often used in cyberattacks.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The command line in the first event checks for the existence of a file and exits based on that. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers. Then, several ImageLoad events show it's loading .NET framework DLLs, which isn't unusual but could be part of malicious activities.\n\nNext, there are file creation events in the Temp directory with random filenames ending in .ps1. This looks like script files being created temporarily, which might be a sign of scripting policy testing or actual malicious scripts.\n\nThere are also whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes running. Whoami is usually benign but can be used to gather system info. The cmd.exe command checks if a file exists and exits accordingly. It seems they're trying to check for files, possibly indicating reconnaissance or setup for further actions.\n\nRegistry value set events from powershell.exe could mean modifying the system's configuration, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system settings to facilitate malicious activities.\n\nLooking at all these together: repeated PowerShell invocations with file checks, temporary script creation, and registry modifications. These behaviors are common in attack chains—like initial access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The use of multiple tools (PowerShell, cmd.exe) adds to the suspicion as attackers often blend activities to avoid detection.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows potentially malicious behavior, so it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activity, including PowerShell command execution attempts, file creation in temporary directories, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given batch of JSONL events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used in attacks, so this catches my attention. The command lines show multiple checks using Test-Path against various file paths, which might indicate an attempt to see if certain scripts exist before proceeding. This behavior could be part of a script deployment or malicious activity trying to verify presence.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are several FileDeleteDetected events and Registry value sets, which might suggest deletion attempts or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, multiple Pipe Created events could be used for inter-process communication, potentially hiding malicious traffic.\n\nThe files involved include .ps1 scripts in temporary directories, such as Get-Keystrokes.ps1. These names sound suspicious; keystroke loggers are often part of malware. Also, the creation and deletion of temporary script files might indicate an attempt to execute code without leaving a permanent trace.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines, possibly trying various payloads or checking for file existence across multiple locations. This could be an attacker testing different infection vectors.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file, which might be unrelated unless it's part of log tampering. However, given the context, focusing on powershell activities is more critical.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity: suspicious script usage, file deletions, registry modifications, and multiple attempts to execute scripts from temporary locations. These indicators collectively raise concerns about a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines attempting to access various files and system components, along with file creation\/deletion events in temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries with different processes and tasks. The first thing that catches my eye is that several events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for system administration but can also be a vector for malicious activities because of its scripting capabilities. So any unusual activity with it should be flagged.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks, I see \"Registry value set\" under winlog for some powershell.exe entries. Registry modifications are common in malware to maintain persistence or change system configurations. That's definitely something to look into because attackers often use registry keys to keep their malicious activities hidden or persistent across reboots.\n\nAnother point is that there's a file created and then deleted by powershell.exe: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. The creation of temporary files, especially scripts, can be a sign of malicious activity because attackers might drop scripts to perform actions without leaving long-term traces on the system.\n\nThere's also an entry where powershell.exe is called with specific command lines: 'powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}'. This looks like a script that recursively lists files, which isn't inherently malicious, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system or as part of lateral movement.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where whoami.exe is executed. While this is typically used to get user information, in certain contexts, especially when combined with other actions, it can be used by attackers to gather credentials or user details for later use.\n\nThe logs also show svchost.exe accessing the registry and making network connections. SvcHost.exe is a legitimate Windows process but is often exploited by malware because of its reputation as a safe process. Malware might inject code into svchost.exe or replace it with malicious binaries, so any unusual activity here should be monitored.\n\nLooking at the file paths and tasks across all events, there's a pattern where multiple processes are accessing system files and components, which could indicate attempts to hide activities or gain persistence. The combination of registry modifications, script creation\/deletion, and network connections is concerning because these behaviors can align with those of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.\n\nMoreover, the use of different tools like chrome.exe making multiple network connections might seem normal, but when coupled with other suspicious events, it could be part of a larger campaign to exfiltrate data or communicate with command-and-control servers.\n\nIn summary, while some individual actions might not raise immediate red flags, the accumulation of these activities—especially the powershell.exe and svchost.exe behaviors, registry modifications, temporary script creation, and network traffic—points towards potential malicious intent. Therefore, this batch of logs is definitely worth investigating further to ensure there's no active compromise or attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes Involved:**\n   - **powershell.exe:** Frequently used for legitimate system admin tasks but can be abused by attackers due to its scripting capabilities. The presence of multiple powershell.exe events suggests monitoring is needed.\n\n2. **Analyze Task Types:**\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Events where powershell.exe sets registry values could indicate attempts at persistence or configuration changes, which are common in malware.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** Powershell.exe creates and deletes a temporary script file. Temporary files can be used maliciously to execute actions without leaving long-term evidence.\n\n3. **Examine Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The command-line arguments for powershell.exe include scripting commands (`ls`, `get-childitem`, `gci`) which recursively list items. While not inherently malicious, such scripts could be part of data gathering or lateral movement tactics.\n\n4. **Review Network Activities:**\n   - svchost.exe making network connections is suspicious because it's often exploited by malware. Unusual network traffic can indicate communication with external servers, possibly command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.\n\n5. **Check for Known Malicious Tools:**\n   - whoami.exe being executed might be used to gather user information, potentially aiding attackers in reconnaissance or credential theft.\n\n6. **Assess File and Path Activity:**\n   - Creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files by winlogbeat.exe could relate to log management tools, but the context with other suspicious activities raises concern about data exfiltration or configuration tampering.\n\n7. **Evaluate Overall Context:**\n   - Combining all these points (powershell.exe actions, registry edits, temporary file handling, network traffic) indicates a pattern consistent with potential malicious behavior, possibly an APT campaign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The batch of logs exhibits multiple red flags indicative of possible malicious activity. Immediate investigation is recommended to assess the risk and determine if a security incident has occurred."}
