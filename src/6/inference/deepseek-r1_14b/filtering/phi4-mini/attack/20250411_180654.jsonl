{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't make a lot of registry changes on its own. If it were doing that repeatedly, maybe something is wrong or malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. I know that whoami is usually harmless and just used to get user information, but sometimes it can be part of more malicious activities if combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe appears several times. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers for executing scripts or commands. The command lines show paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which immediately raises suspicion. Those scripts might be trying to log keystrokes, which is a classic sign of malware.\n\nThere are also multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell when it runs scripts, but combined with the other activities, it might indicate something more malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation and deletion events involving temporary files in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The script creates a .ps1 file and then deletes it quickly, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by antivirus software or user notice.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle tasks from powershell.exe might be part of normal operation, but when combined with the other events, they add to the suspicion.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of PowerShell executing scripts, especially those named Get-Keystrokes, along with file operations and registry changes, strongly suggests malicious activity. The pattern of actions is indicative of potential malware attempting to log keystrokes and possibly persistence through registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe executions with suspicious command lines involving Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts, which are often used for malicious activities like keylogging. Additionally, there are repeated registry changes and file operations that may indicate unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines running scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious because it implies keylogging, which is a common tactic for malware to capture keystrokes and steal information.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with these scripts pointing to different paths on the system. The paths seem to vary slightly each time, like C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and others. This suggests that the script might be moving around or trying to avoid detection by using different locations.\n\nAnother red flag is the registration tasks and file creations related to these scripts. For example, there are events where powershell.exe sets registry values and creates files in various directories, including user-specific AppData folders. These activities could indicate an attempt to make the script persistent across reboots or to store captured data in locations that are more likely to be overlooked.\n\nAlso, I notice some events from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. While this might seem normal for a log management tool, the combination with the other powershell activity makes me question if it's part of the same malicious process or just coincidental. It's possible that the script is using legitimate tools' behaviors to blend in.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple entries from different processes (powershell.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe) all performing similar actions adds to my concern. Malware often uses various methods to execute and persist, so seeing these together isn't a good sign.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell with keylogging scripts, coupled with suspicious file and registry activities, makes this batch of logs definitely worth investigating further. There's a high likelihood of malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with varying paths, indicating possible persistence or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
