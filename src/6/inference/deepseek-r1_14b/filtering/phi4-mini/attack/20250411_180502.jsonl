I'll start by going through each event one by one to spot any patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome is a web browser that makes those types of calls frequently. Nothing suspicious there right away.\n\nNext, looking at the powershell.exe events. The command line shows some PowerShell commands starting other processes. For example, \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process...}\" which suggests they're executing scripts or batch files. I need to look closer at what these scripts are doing.\n\nI notice that a file is being created and then immediately deleted: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\". This temporary script creation might be an attempt to execute code without leaving a permanent trace, which is a common tactic in malware or unauthorized activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry modifications by both powershell.exe and other processes like Calculator.exe. Modifying the Windows Registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malicious actors to ensure their code runs on subsequent boot-ups.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of Provider Lifecycle events with different batch files being executed. This could indicate an attempt to run multiple scripts, possibly trying to obfuscate their true purpose or spread out activities to avoid detection.\n\nWhile there are some legitimate actions like image loading and process creation that powershell.exe does normally, the combination of creating and deleting a script file, modifying registry entries, and executing external batch files raises concerns. These behaviors don't typically occur in standard user activity and could be indicators of malicious intent.\n\nHowever, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more detailed logs showing the impact of these processes (like changes to system configurations or data exfiltration), it's hard to be certain. Still, the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell process creations and activities such as file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and script execution attempts which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'm looking at multiple JSON objects representing different processes and their associated log entries.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values repeatedly. That might be normal user activity, but too many such events could indicate suspicious behavior. Then there are powershell.exe processes creating files and accessing the registry. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting, but it's also a common tool for attackers to execute malicious commands.\n\nThe presence of cmd.exe executing batch scripts adds another layer. Batch scripts can automate tasks, some of which might be harmful. Notably, there are attempts to create files in user directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads, which could be signs of file creation activities that shouldn't happen normally.\n\nAdditionally, the use of svchost.exe, typically a legitimate Windows process, creating files might raise eyebrows if it's deviating from its usual behavior. There's also conhost.exe involved in registry changes, which is another red flag since it's commonly used by attackers to host malicious content.\n\nLooking at the file paths mentioned, such as 'C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario' and 'C:\\entrada_ativo', they seem to point towards structured directories that might not be standard on a typical system. The creation of files like 'componente_principal.txt' in user downloads could indicate data exfiltration or file installation.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the combination of multiple processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe) performing various actions—registry modifications, file creations, and potentially executing scripts—suggests possible malicious activity. These events don't seem to align with normal system operations and could be part of a coordinated attack or an attempt to establish persistence.\n\nTherefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation as it exhibits behaviors that may indicate compromise or malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe show repeated registry modifications and file creations in user directories, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
