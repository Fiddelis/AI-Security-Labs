{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's look through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The command lines show that powershell is being executed with specific scripts. For example, one script uses Add-Type to load the System.Windows.Forms assembly and takes a screenshot of the screen. This seems suspicious because taking screenshots can be part of data exfiltration or surveillance.\n\nLooking at other processes: whoami.exe is run, which might seem normal but if it's executed by another process like powershell, it could be for privilege escalation or info gathering. Svchost.exe is involved in a registry event; while svchost is a legitimate process, unexpected registry changes can indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are several Registry value set events from powershell.exe. This could be an attempt to modify system configurations, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior maliciously.\n\nMultiple Image loaded tasks for various DLLs suggest that powershell is loading external libraries. While this isn't inherently bad, certain DLLs can indicate malicious activity. The mention of mscoree.dll andclrjit.dll makes me think it's using .NET framework, which is common in scripts but could also be part of exploit code.\n\nThe later events have command lines with long powershell commands that create bitmaps and save them to temp files. This looks like an attempt to capture screenshots without user interaction, which is a classic sign of malicious activity, possibly for screen scraping or capturing sensitive information.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated powershell executions with screenshot code, registry modifications, and multiple processes loading various DLLs. These are red flags for potential malicious behavior. The high number of powershell events with suspicious command lines strengthens the case that this batch is not just normal activity but indicates something malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts, including taking screenshots and making registry changes. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all involve powershell.exe with command lines that include adding types from System.Windows.Forms and capturing screenshots. This seems suspicious because screen capture activities in PowerShell are often used by malware or scripts to take screenshots of the desktop, which could be part of an information theft or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe next set of events shows file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1). This is concerning because creating and then deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection. Malware often does this to leave no trace after executing malicious scripts.\n\nThere are also multiple events where powershell.exe interacts with the registry, like setting values. Registry modifications are common in persistence mechanisms; attackers might set registry keys to ensure their malware runs on each system startup or modifies security settings.\n\nOther events include pipe creations and file operations related to legitimate programs like Chrome and Calculator. These could be normal activities, but when combined with other suspicious behaviors, they raise flags. For example, a remote command execution task (Execute a Remote Command) logged twice might indicate an attacker executing commands over a remote connection or using PowerShell's remoting features.\n\nThere are some events from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files, which could be part of log management but don't seem malicious on their own unless they're being used to exfiltrate data.\n\nConsidering the combination of multiple powershell.exe activities (screen captures, script file operations, registry changes) along with remote command executions and other system processes accessing resources, it's clear that there are several red flags. The repetitive use of powershell.exe for screen capture suggests a possible screenshotting malware or an attacker trying to collect visual data from the system.\n\nI'm also noting that some events have 'None' in file paths, which could mean the event doesn't involve file operations but might still be part of a broader attack chain. For instance, pipe creations are common in inter-process communication and can be used maliciously for command and control.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities don't fit typical user behavior and align with known tactics used by cyber attackers. The high number of powershell.exe instances with suspicious commands increases the confidence that this batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes performing screen captures, file operations, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script are red flags indicative of malware or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events have \"process\" as chrome.exe. That's normal since Chrome is a common process and often logs multiple events. Each event has different tasks under winlog.\n\nLooking at the first five entries: They all say \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". This indicates that Chrome is making changes to the Windows registry, which isn't unusual because applications often do that for settings or configurations. So these alone aren't a red flag.\n\nNext, there's an event with \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\". Browsers like Chrome perform DNS queries when navigating to websites, so this is expected behavior too. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen I see two events where \"Image loaded\" happens, loading specific DLLs. The first one is amsi.dll, which stands for Anti-Malware Scan Interface. This is part of Windows' built-in security features and is typically used by anti-malware tools to scan files. However, legitimate processes like Chrome might load this for various reasons, including security checks.\n\nThe second image load is MpOAV.dll, from the Microsoft Defender directory. That's definitely a legitimate file used by Windows Defender to provide additional antivirus capabilities. It's completely normal for Chrome or any process to load this DLL as part of system operations.\n\nFinally, another registry event, so nothing new there.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple registry writes, a DNS query, and loading some DLLs. Since all these actions are common for a running instance of Chrome, especially when it's interacting with security components and performing network requests, this doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity.\n\nI also don't see any inconsistencies in the paths or tasks that would suggest something is wrong. The files being loaded are standard system DLLs, and the registry operations are typical for an application like Chrome managing its settings or extensions.\n\nSo overall, while each individual event might look a bit concerning on its own, when viewed as a whole, they all fit within normal operational patterns of the Chrome browser interacting with Windows' security mechanisms. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem particularly interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations of the Chrome process, including registry modifications and loading legitimate system DLLs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
