{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to the process \"powershell.exe\". PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a red flag for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Each event shows different actions associated with PowerShell processes. For example, some entries mention command lines that include script commands like using 'findstr' and 'select-string' with patterns related to \"pass\". That seems suspicious—looking for password-like strings in various file types is a common tactic for credential harvesting.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where PowerShell creates temporary files in the user's AppData directory. Specifically, it creates and then deletes a script file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". This behavior could indicate that an attacker is trying to execute malicious scripts without leaving long-term traces. The creation and immediate deletion of such files might be part of an attempt to evade detection or clean up after themselves.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks associated with the same PowerShell command line. I'm not entirely sure what this entails, but repeated provider events could suggest that a script is being loaded or unloaded multiple times, possibly indicating module loading or malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an entry where whoami.exe was executed, which typically retrieves user information. While legitimate in some contexts, it can be used by attackers to gather system information for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nNotably, the logs show both file creation and deletion events of temporary PowerShell scripts, along with registry access. These actions are often part of persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts. Registry modifications might be an attempt to maintain persistence between sessions, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe high volume of events related to the same command line suggests automated or script-based activity. Such patterns could indicate a potential botnet activity or a compromised system running malicious scripts at intervals.\n\nWhile there are normal processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe accessing resources, it's the concentrated and repeated suspicious activities around PowerShell that stand out as concerning. The combination of creating temporary files, deleting them immediately, searching for sensitive data, and repeated provider events raises red flags about potential malicious behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all these events together, the activity seems to align with indicators of compromise, such as credential dumping, script execution, file manipulation, and possible persistence mechanisms. This makes the batch of logs highly relevant for further investigation into a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system log entries contain several red flags indicative of potentially malicious activities:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Instances**: The repeated invocation of `powershell.exe` with specific command-line arguments is concerning. Notably, some commands include searching for patterns related to \"pass\" in files, which could indicate attempts to harvest sensitive information such as passwords.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation and Deletion**: The creation of a temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1`) followed by its deletion suggests an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving long-term traces, possibly to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Registry Access**: Entries where `notepad.exe` and other processes access the registry might indicate efforts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms typical of malware.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: Multiple events under \"Provider Lifecycle\" associated with PowerShell commands could suggest module loading\/unloading, which is often seen in malicious scripts aiming for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n5. **Legitimate Tools Misuse**: Tools like `whoami.exe` and `calc.exe` are typically benign, but their presence alongside other suspicious activities could signal attackers using them for reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these factors—suspicious script execution, file manipulation, registry access, and repeated provider events—points to a potential security incident. This batch of logs warrants further investigation into possible malicious activity within the system."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze this batch of log events. First, I notice a lot of activity from powershell.exe and findstr.exe. These are often used in scripts for various purposes, but sometimes they can be indicators of malicious behavior because attackers might use them to search for sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a script that uses findstr to look for \"pass\" in XML, DOC, TXT, and XLS files. This seems suspicious because it could indicate someone trying to extract passwords or sensitive data. The fact that powershell is used alongside this makes me more cautious, as powershell can be a tool for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repeated Registry value sets by svchost.exe and other processes like conhost.exe. These system processes being modified could signal an attempt to persistence or change system configurations in a way that might not be normal. Also, there are multiple instances where files are created or accessed, which might be part of setting up some kind of malicious activity.\n\nThe presence of urlmon.dll loaded by Calculator.exe is unusual. While Calculator can load various DLLs for functionality, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use legitimate processes to hide their activities. Additionally, the OfficeClickToRun and ApplicationFrameHost entries could relate to legitimate operations, but the combination with other events makes me think something might be off.\n\nI also see that there are multiple DnsQuery tasks from chrome.exe and other processes. While this is common for browser activity, the volume here along with the other suspicious activities could indicate an attempt to communicate with external servers or resolve domains that shouldn't be accessed from this system.\n\nConsidering all these points together—suspicious command-line arguments in powershell, file searching scripts, registry modifications, and elevated DNS queries—it seems like there's a pattern that might not be normal. This batch of events could indicate malicious behavior, so it should be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe commands searching for sensitive data, repeated registry modifications, and unusual file accesses which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where chrome.exe is involved. Some of these are about Image Load and Registry value sets, which aren't too unusual since Chrome does interact with system files and registry settings regularly. But then I notice a lot of Network connection detections from chrome.exe. Four events in a row showing network connections could be suspicious. Maybe Chrome is connecting to multiple domains or IPs, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nNext, there are some PowerShell activities. One event shows the creation of 'objeto_logico.txt' and another of 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. The names don't immediately sound malicious, but PowerShell is often used by attackers for command-line operations. Also, the fact that these files were created in a user's Downloads folder could be concerning if those files are being generated without user interaction.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe was executed via cmd.exe. Whoami is typically used to get system information, but when combined with other actions like process creation and registry modifications, it might indicate someone trying to gather system details or escalate privileges.\n\nLooking further, I see schtasks.exe being used multiple times with commands that delete specific tasks. The task names have patterns like \"_005_OnLogon\" and \"_005_OnStartup\". This seems intentional. SchTasks is a legitimate tool for scheduling tasks, but deleting existing ones could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe was used with schtasks to delete tasks, which adds to the suspicion. Additionally, there are registry events from svchost.exe and multiple RegistryEvent entries from chrome.exe. While svchost is a common process, any significant changes to the registry can be signs of malware modifying system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of network connections from Chrome, suspicious file creations with PowerShell, execution of whoami via cmd, and deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks and cmd. These activities could indicate someone trying to establish persistence, gather information, or cover their tracks. While some events might be benign, the combination raises red flags about potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including network connections from chrome.exe, file creations with PowerShell, execution of whoami.exe via cmd, and deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks. These indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries in the JSONL format, each line being a separate event. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The task is to analyze all these together as a whole batch.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them involve processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, WMIC.exe, notepad.exe, conhost.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe. These are all legitimate Windows system tools and executables, but they can sometimes be used maliciously.\n\nThe winlog field shows different tasks like Image loaded, Registry object added\/deleted, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. The file field sometimes has a path, but often it's None.\n\nI'll start by examining the processes:\n\n1. schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll: Schtasks is for scheduled tasks. Loading system32 files seems normal.\n2. svchost.exe registry changes: Svchost is part of services; registry activity might be normal depending on what's done.\n3. cmd.exe with command lines that seem to execute other commands, like deleting processes or users: The command lines are obfuscated with quotes and some special characters, but they appear to delete specific user accounts (e.g., \"net user \/del tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\"). This could be legitimate admin activity or part of a cleanup by malware.\n4. powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values multiple times: PowerShell is often used for both good and bad purposes. Multiple accesses might indicate scripting or automated tasks, possibly malicious if the scripts are doing something harmful.\n5. whoami.exe being run with command line arguments: Whoami typically just shows user info, but running it without any unusual parameters doesn't seem suspicious here.\n6. WMIC.exe loading various DLLs and deleting processes: WMIC is a powerful tool for remote management but can also be used maliciously to delete files or processes. The command lines show deletion of notepad.exe processes and specific users, which could be part of a cleanup after malicious activity.\n7. net.exe and net1.exe deleting users: These are legitimate commands for network operations, but again, if used without proper authorization, they might indicate unauthorized access.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern:\n\n- Multiple deletions of user accounts (e.g., tarefa_auxiliar_Admin, componentes_comum_Admin) via cmd.exe and net.exe\/net1.exe. Deleting users is a high privilege action that could be malicious.\n- Use of WMIC to delete processes: This can be used by attackers to remove evidence or to stop security tools.\n- Frequent use of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry modifications: PowerShell is commonly used in attacks for its scripting capabilities, which can help hide malicious activities.\n- cmd.exe running various commands that could indicate a script trying to cover tracks or perform unauthorized deletions.\n\nConsidering all these together:\n\nThe batch shows multiple processes being created and modified, especially deletion of user accounts and processes. The combination of using tools like powershell, cmd, net, and WMIC in such a way suggests possible unauthorized access or malicious activity. It's not just one off incidents but several events that together point towards potential compromise.\n\nI'm thinking about indicators of compromise (IoCs) here. For example, the deletion of user accounts could be part of an attack to remove evidence or disable accounts. The use of WMIC for process termination might be to prevent detection or stop security tools from running. The multiple powershell.exe accesses might indicate script execution or lateral movement in a network.\n\nAlso, the command lines are sometimes obfuscated with quotes and special characters (like \\\/c instead of \/c), which is a common technique to bypass certain antivirus detection by encoding commands differently.\n\nAnother point is that some processes like net1.exe are less commonly used, and seeing it being used for user deletions could be suspicious. It might not be a standard command-line tool, so its use here stands out.\n\nIn terms of TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures), this seems to align with attack behaviors such as:\n\n- Persistence: Using registry modifications to maintain access.\n- Privilege escalation: Deleting users or processes to gain higher privileges or hide traces.\n- Lateral movement: Using powershell for command execution across systems.\n- Exfiltration\/Communication: Not directly seen here, but the deletions might be part of a larger plan.\n\nIn conclusion, while each individual event could have benign explanations (like admin performing maintenance), the volume and combination suggest malicious activity. It's like seeing multiple tools being used in a way that's beyond normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits characteristics indicative of potential malicious activity. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Process Activity**: The frequent use of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe to execute commands suggests scripting or automated tasks, which could be malicious.\n\n2. **User Deletions**: Multiple deletions of user accounts via cmd.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe raise concerns about unauthorized access or attempts to remove evidence.\n\n3. **Process Termination**: WMIC.exe is used to delete processes, potentially to prevent detection or stop security tools, aligning with tactics used in attacks.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Powershell.exe accessing registry values and svchost.exe modifying the registry could indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes.\n\n5. **Obfuscation Techniques**: Command lines using quotes and special characters (e.g., \\\/c) suggest attempts to bypass detection, a common tactic in malware.\n\n6. **Indicators of Compromise**: The combination of tools and activities aligns with attack behaviors such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and evidence destruction.\n\n**Conclusion**: While individual events might have benign explanations, the pattern and volume of activity strongly suggest potential malicious intent, indicating possible compromise or unauthorized access."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of process creations and some registry changes. \n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being used with specific commands. For example, one line shows 'cmd.exe' deleting a user account over the network: \"net user \\\"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\\\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That looks like an attempt to delete a user account, which could be malicious if unauthorized.\n\nAnother process is 'sc.exe delete win32times', which deletes a service. If this isn't part of legitimate system maintenance, it might indicate someone trying to remove monitoring tools or backdoors.\n\nThere's also a lot of registry activity from various processes like conhost.exe and services.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so repeated writes could be suspicious.\n\nThe commands like 'whoami.exe' don't seem harmful on their own but when combined with other activities might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nGiven all these actions—user deletions, service removals, registry changes—they collectively suggest potential unauthorized access or malicious activity. I'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletion commands and service modifications indicate potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp directory. The command lines show deletion commands using del with specific filenames. This could be suspicious because deleting temp files isn't inherently bad, but when combined with other activities, it might suggest something malicious like cleaning up traces of an attack.\n\nThen there are several instances where PowerShell is being executed. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The fact that powershell.exe is accessed multiple times raises a red flag, especially since some command lines look unusual, like 'powershell.exe & {}'. This might indicate that the script is trying to execute something in a way that's not typical.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes, I see events like Process Create, Registry value set, File Delete logged, and Image loaded. These actions are concerning because they involve creating new processes, modifying registry entries, deleting files, and loading images which could be signs of malicious behavior.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which can be used to gather user information. This is often part of an attacker's toolkit to escalate privileges or understand the environment better.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file in the Temp directory. The creation and subsequent deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 suggests that a malicious script might have been executed, possibly testing system policies before executing something more harmful.\n\nThe repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in command lines looks suspicious because it's not a standard way to invoke PowerShell. It might be an attempt to bypass certain security mechanisms or execute code without being easily detected.\n\nPutting all these events together: multiple cmd deletions, powershell executions with unusual command lines, registry modifications, whoami usage, file creation and deletion of script files—this pattern looks like it could be part of a malicious activity chain. It seems like an attacker is trying to delete evidence, run scripts for various purposes, and possibly move within the system.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of potential malicious behavior because the combination of these actions isn't typical user behavior. However, without more context or additional logs, it's hard to be certain. But given the information provided, there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including deletion of files via cmd.exe, extensive use of powershell.exe with unusual command lines, and actions that could indicate malicious behavior such as registry modifications and file deletions.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through them one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst event: It's a PowerShell process with the command line looking a bit odd because it ends with &, which might be incomplete or part of some obfuscation. The Windows log task is \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which I'm not too familiar with, but it seems normal.\n\nSecond event: Again, PowerShell loading a DLL file. That's common since PowerShell uses various DLLs for operations. The path here looks legitimate, pointing to Windows Defender files. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nThird event: PowerShell creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but sometimes scripts create or access such files, so it's on the radar but not necessarily bad.\n\nFourth and fifth events: Both are about registry value sets by PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, but they're also a common tactic for malware to persistence. However, without seeing multiple writes or changes in protected areas, it might just be normal script activity.\n\nLooking through the next few events, there's a lot of Process Create events for whoami.exe and other benign processes like calc.exe and notepad.exe. These are common tools and often used by scripts or legitimate users to check user permissions, so that doesn't raise red flags unless they're being executed in an unusual way.\n\nThere are several instances where PowerShell is accessing other processes (ProcessAccess). This can be part of normal scripting or could indicate lateral movement if combined with other signs. But on its own, it's not enough to conclude anything malicious.\n\nThe events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files seem related to the log shipping tool. It's installing or configuring itself, which is expected and not concerning unless there are unauthorized access patterns.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe is involved in several registry writes. SvcHost is a common process for services, so this could be part of normal service operations, but it can also be used by malware to hide their processes. However, without additional indicators like unusual network traffic or file modifications, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, there are multiple events involving PowerShell and some registry modifications, which are both tools that attackers might use. But each event individually doesn't cross into malicious territory. The batch shows normal user activity with scripts running, legitimate processes starting, and system tools accessing resources. There's no clear evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known attack patterns.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while some activities are concerning on their own, without more context or multiple signs pointing to malicious behavior, it's safer to label this as not particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal user activity with scripts running PowerShell, legitimate processes starting, and system tools accessing resources.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so that's a bit suspicious on its own. But without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nNext up is whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal; maybe someone was checking their user privileges or something. Not too concerning by itself.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event. So now we have two instances of PowerShell accessing things. That could be a red flag. Maybe the same process as before, but without knowing what commands were run, it's unclear.\n\nThen there are events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying registry values. These are standard system processes; they might just be updating some settings. Registry changes aren't unusual, so maybe not an issue.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe, I see multiple DNS queries and network connections. Chrome is a browser, so it's normal for it to make DNS requests to load pages and connect to servers. The number of events here seems high, but without specific URLs or IPs flagged, it doesn't indicate malicious activity. Maybe the user was browsing multiple sites or there were several tabs open.\n\nPutting it all together: There are two powershell.exe accesses, which could be worrying, but nothing indicates they did anything harmful. The rest of the processes like whoami, ApplicationFrameHost, Calculator, and chrome seem to be doing normal things. No file access is reported in any of these events, so maybe no actual data was exfiltrated or modified.\n\nI don't see any signs of account creation, changes to system configurations that would stand out, or other indicators of compromise like multiple failed logins or unusual process trees. The events are spread across different processes but nothing ties them together in a way that suggests malicious behavior as a whole batch.\n\nSo overall, while there are some points that might raise an eyebrow individually, the entire set doesn't present enough evidence to justify an investigation. It's possible these are just normal user activities with maybe a bit of extra PowerShell usage.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system processes and activities such as process creations, registry changes, DNS queries, and network connections from common applications like Chrome.
