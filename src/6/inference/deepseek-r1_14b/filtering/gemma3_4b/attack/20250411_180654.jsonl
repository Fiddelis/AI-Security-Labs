Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference various PowerShell scripts, specifically Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it might be related to capturing keystrokes, which could indicate malicious activity like keylogging.\n\nI notice that several events show powershell.exe accessing files and registry entries. For example, one event has the file path pointing to a temporary log file (key.log), which is often used by malware to store stolen data. Additionally, there are multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe, but I'm not sure if those are suspicious on their own.\n\nThere's also an instance where whoami.exe was run, which might be used to gather user information, potentially part of reconnaissance activities before more malicious actions.\n\nThe repeated execution of the same PowerShell script with slightly different paths could indicate a persistence mechanism or multiple attempts to execute the same payload. This repetition raises concern as it suggests automated or malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, access to potentially sensitive files and registry keys, and repetitive patterns—it's likely that this batch is indicative of malicious activity. The confidence level isn't 100% because some events like chrome.exe accessing the registry might be benign, but the overall pattern strongly suggests investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and creating temporary log files suggest possible keylogging or unauthorized data capture.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. These scripts are often used for logging keystrokes, which could indicate malicious activity like keylogging to capture sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog events, there's a combination of file creations and deletions. For example, powershell.exe creates temporary files in various locations, including C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The fact that these files are created and then deleted (as seen in FileDeleteDetected) is a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repeated loading of DLLs related to Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. While these are legitimate files, the way they're being loaded by powershell.exe could be an attempt to bypass security measures or inject malicious code.\n\nThere are also events where conhost.exe and svchost.exe interact with files. These processes are often used in malware for persistence or privilege escalation. The file paths mentioned, like C:\\modulo_padrao\\pacote_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1, suggest a structured directory that might be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where the same script paths are being executed across different directories (e.g., modulo_padrao, elemento_base). This repetition could indicate an attempt to spread or load components of malware from various locations, possibly to avoid detection or ensure persistence.\n\nThe use of temporary files and registry modifications is another sign. Powershell.exe modifying the registry without clear legitimate cause might be setting up persistence points for the malware to survive reboots.\n\nLastly, the events involving winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files could be unrelated, but given the context of other suspicious activities, it's worth monitoring whether this tool is being used maliciously or if its presence is coincidental.\n\nPutting it all together, the recurring powershell executions with keylogging scripts, file deletions to cover tracks, and potential malware-related process interactions strongly suggest a security event that requires investigation. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which are known for keylogging.
