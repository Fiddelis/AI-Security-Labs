Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all seem to be PowerShell processes creating scheduled tasks. The command line shows that it's executing a script to register new scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask. Each task has an action to run calc.exe on startup, targeting the Administrators group with high privileges. This caught my attention because creating multiple scheduled tasks, especially ones that execute arbitrary commands at logon, can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nI notice each event uses a slightly different name for the scheduled task, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. Using unique names might be an attempt to avoid detection or to create multiple persistence points, which is common in malware campaigns. The fact that all these tasks are being created at logon by the Administrators group with elevated privileges also raises a red flag because such actions often aren't part of normal user activity.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading various .NET framework components. These might be part of the script's execution, but seeing multiple registry writes without clear justification could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. The ImageLoad events show that powershell.exe is loading several DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe last few events involve Chrome.exe creating a pipe and writing to the registry. While this might seem unrelated at first glance, it's worth considering if there's any correlation between these actions. Malware sometimes uses legitimate processes like Chrome to hide its activities or create more complex attack vectors.\n\nPutting all of this together, the batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges and some other system interactions that don't immediately seem benign. The repetitive creation of similar tasks is concerning because it could indicate an attempt to ensure persistence across reboots, which is a common tactic in malicious software. While not conclusive on its own, this pattern suggests potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations**: Several PowerShell processes create scheduled tasks using `Register-ScheduledTask`. Each task runs `calc.exe` at startup with high privileges under the Administrators group. The use of unique task names suggests an attempt to avoid detection and ensure persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: There are multiple events where registry values are being accessed or modified, which could be part of establishing persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Image Load Events**: PowerShell loads various .NET framework DLLs, which is normal but when combined with other activities, raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Chrome Activity**: Although less concerning on its own, the creation of a pipe and registry writes by Chrome.exe might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity within a legitimate process.\n\n**Conclusion**: The repetitive and privileged task creations, coupled with other system interactions, strongly suggest potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior. This batch should be investigated further for signs of compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The first two show that powershell.exe loaded an image (MpOAV.dll) and created a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Then, it deleted that same file. This pattern—create then delete—is suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious scripts which they later clean up.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe is used with a command line argument. The command seems to be creating a scheduled task using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. The action is set to execute calc.exe at logon as an Administrator with highest privileges. That's concerning because calc.exe isn't typically malicious on its own, but the way it's being executed suggests persistence mechanisms. Using 'calc.exe' might be a test or a step in a larger attack.\n\nThen, there are several events from chrome.exe where registry values are being set multiple times. While modifying the registry is common, doing so repeatedly could indicate some form of persistence or unwanted behavior, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nThe latter part of the log has numerous entries where the process is None and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This suggests remote execution attempts which could be an indicator of remote control or malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe executing commands to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe, deleting temporary files, combined with remote command executions and chrome.exe registry modifications. These activities are red flags for potential malicious behavior such as persistence, file deletion to cover tracks, and remote access attempts. The confidence level is high because multiple events across different processes indicate coordinated suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows powershell.exe creating and deleting a script file, registering scheduled tasks with calc.exe, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, and numerous remote command executions. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms and unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's an entry from WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is a legitimate Windows process related to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). It's not something unusual, so I'm not worried about that.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is another standard Windows process that hosts various services, and it's common for it to interact with the registry. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks don't immediately raise a red flag, but they do happen quite often, so maybe worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThen there's a file creation event by svchost.exe under the Tasks folder named \"unidade_comum\". That translates to something like \"common unit\", which doesn't sound malicious per se, but it's in the System32 directory. I'll need to check if this is part of normal system operations or if it's a new file that shouldn't be there.\n\nMoving on, there are two events where powershell.exe creates files: one under the user's AppData folder and another in the Downloads folder with specific filenames like \"entrada_principal.txt\" and \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\". Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's creating files in these locations could be concerning, especially if they're named unusually. I should consider whether these are part of normal scripts or potential malicious payloads.\n\nThere's also an event where a remote command is executed. Since powershell can execute commands remotely, this could be an indicator of command-line abuse, which is often seen in attacks. This makes the batch more suspicious as remote command execution is a common tactic for adversaries.\n\nLooking at conhost.exe and chrome.exe entries, they show several registry modifications and image loads. Conhost is associated with command prompt or other shells, but its activity here doesn't seem out of place. Chrome's events include loading normal DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate. However, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe might be worth investigating if they're unexpected.\n\nAnother point to note is that some processes don't have associated files or paths, like when process is None. This could mean missing data, but since there's no indication of an error code or other anomalies, I'll assume it's just incomplete logging.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the combination of multiple registry changes by different processes, file creations by powershell.exe in user directories, and remote command execution stands out as potentially malicious. While some activities are normal, the volume and types of events suggest possible unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this batch seems interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including remote command execution, file creations by PowerShell in user directories, and repeated registry modifications which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
