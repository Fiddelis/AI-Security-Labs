{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome does a lot of networking. But then I see powershell.exe with some suspicious activities. It sets registry values, creates files in temporary directories, and deletes them shortly after. The command lines show that PowerShell is starting other processes with .bat files, which could be executing scripts.\n\nThe file operations are concerning because creating and immediately deleting a script file might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security measures or leave less trace. Also, the fact that multiple different paths are being used in the command lines for Powershell suggests some level of scripting complexity or potential automation.\n\nLooking at the RegistryEvent tasks on powershell.exe and other processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. The repeated Provider Lifecycle events might be related to Windows components, but when combined with the file and process activities in PowerShell, it raises suspicion.\n\nI'm also noticing that some command lines are obfuscated or have complex paths, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection. The combination of registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and network connections (from Chrome) could be part of a broader attack vector where the attacker uses legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's enough activity that stands out as potentially malicious or at least indicative of something unusual happening on the system. The confidence isn't super high because some actions might still be benign, but the red flags are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts and creating\/deleting files in temporary directories suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of registry modifications, file operations, and command-line obfuscation raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where processes like Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, and others are performing tasks such as Registry value sets, Image loads, Process accesses, and File creations. \n\nStarting with the first event: Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because built-in apps might need to access certain settings. But I should check if there's anything unusual about the specific registry key being modified.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears several times. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The events show it accessing processes and loading images like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These DLLs are part of Windows Defender and URL handling respectively, which might seem normal, but sometimes malicious scripts load them to hide their tracks or inject code.\n\nThen there's a chrome.exe event where multiple Registry value sets occur. Browsers often interact with the registry for settings, so this alone isn't suspicious unless it's an unusual number or specific keys being modified. The Image loads into AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and MpOAV DLLs are part of normal operations to scan scripts or files, so that doesn't raise a red flag immediately.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe events, one is executing a batch script from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\...\" which might be legitimate depending on the system's configuration. However, without knowing if this script is authorized, it's hard to say. The other cmd.exe event is setting a registry value, which again could be normal or part of malicious activity.\n\nConhost.exe is used by command-line tools like cmd, so seeing it perform Registry operations isn't unusual unless it's being used in an unexpected context.\n\nSVCHost.exe is a common system process that hosts various services. The file created here seems related to Windows Update's Delivery Optimization, which is standard behavior for updates and patches.\n\nThe powershell.exe event creating \"componente_principal.txt\" in the Downloads folder could be part of script execution or data handling. Again, without more context, it's hard to assess its intent.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are multiple instances of processes performing tasks that can be malicious, none of them stand out as clearly indicative of an attack. For example, the powershell.exe activities include both normal and potentially suspicious actions, but they might just be part of system administration or legitimate script execution. The high number of Registry value sets by chrome.exe is a bit concerning, but it's not uncommon for browsers to interact with the registry. Without detecting specific malicious patterns or known bad actor behaviors across these events, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as not particularly interesting from a security standpoint.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these activities could be part of a larger campaign. For example, multiple Registry modifications by different processes might indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes for malware. The creation of files in user directories (like the PowerShell StartupProfileData and componente_principal.txt) could be signs of malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or drop files.\n\nOn balance, while there are red flags, they aren't definitive enough without additional context or evidence of known exploit patterns. Therefore, I would conclude that this batch doesn't show clear signs of a security incident but might warrant closer monitoring or deeper investigation if more information is available.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: Not Interesting**\n\nThe analysis of the event logs indicates that while there are activities that could potentially be suspicious, they do not conclusively point to a cybersecurity incident. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications**: Processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe modifying registry values are common for legitimate operations and system settings.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activities**: Although PowerShell is often used by attackers, the observed actions (accessing processes, loading DLLs) could be part of normal administrative tasks or script execution without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Browser Behavior**: Chrome's interactions with the registry and DLLs are within expected bounds for browser operations and anti-malware activities.\n\n4. **Command-Line Tools**: Cmd.exe and conhost.exe performing Registry operations align with their usual functionalities, especially when executing scripts or commands.\n\n5. **File Creations**: The creation of files by svchost.exe and powershell.exe appears related to system optimization and legitimate script execution, respectively.\n\n**Conclusion**: While there are notable activities that could be monitored, they lack the definitive indicators of a security breach. This batch does not currently warrant immediate concern but should be kept under surveillance for any emerging patterns or additional suspicious behaviors."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I see that most of the events are from \"chrome.exe\" and involve registry value sets. Registry activity can be common, especially in legitimate software updates or changes. Chrome is known to make such registry modifications during updates or configuration changes, so multiple entries here might not raise any red flags on their own.\n\nHowever, there's one event from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I recognize as the file output component of the Elastic WinlogBeat tool used for log shipping. It created a new YAML configuration file in the user's Downloads folder. That seems normal if someone is setting up or updating their log management tools.\n\nThen there's an entry from \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named \"elemento_base.txt\". PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be concerning. Malware might drop files via PowerShell scripts to execute malicious commands or store data. The filename \"elemento_base.txt\" doesn't immediately suggest anything malicious, but it's worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes from Chrome, which is expected; a log file creation by Winlogbeat, which is part of the monitoring setup; and a PowerShell script creating an arbitrary text file. While each event isn't alarming individually, the combination could warrant closer inspection. The repeated registry writes might be normal, but paired with the PowerShell activity, it's possible they're part of a malicious process or just legitimate actions.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the PowerShell activity is a potential red flag, and I want to ensure there's no ongoing malicious behavior. However, if these were isolated incidents without other suspicious patterns, I might have considered them less concerning. But considering all events together, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation activities, including a PowerShell script creating a file in the Downloads folder.
