{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe showing network connections. That's common since browsers do connect to the internet frequently. Not a red flag yet.\n\nNext, I see MpDefenderCoreService.exe also made a network connection. That makes sense because it's part of the antivirus software; it might be updating or scanning online.\n\nThen, there are several instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and persistence, but it can also be legitimate. I'll need to look at the context. The events show 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set', which could be normal admin tasks or part of malicious activities.\n\nI notice whoami.exe being run. This is a standard tool to check user permissions, so unless it's used in an unexpected way, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are multiple cmd.exe processes with commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' and using findstr.exe to search for .key files. Searching for specific file types could indicate someone looking for sensitive information or keys, which is a bit concerning.\n\nLooking at the file events, powershell.exe created a file named tarefa_geral.txt. Without knowing what's inside, it's hard to say, but creating files with PowerShell can be part of malicious scripts.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating configuration files seems normal if that's part of their setup for logging.\n\nRegistry modifications are happening across various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms or legitimate configurations, so I need to assess the context.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe making registry changes could be unusual. Notepad is typically used for editing text files, so why would it modify the registry? That might warrant closer inspection.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal as that's a standard system file.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and the registry, cmd.exe searching for .key files, and notepad.exe modifying the registry. These behaviors could indicate an attacker trying to gather information, establish persistence, or execute malicious scripts. The combination suggests possible unauthorized activity rather than normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and the registry, cmd.exe searching for .key files, and notepad.exe modifying the registry, which could indicate potential malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's a Calculator.exe loading the urlmon.dll file. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows app and urlmon is part of Windows System32, which handles URL operations. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common system process that runs various services. Registry changes by svchost are typical and not unusual on their own. So I don't see any red flags yet.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup, used for log shipping. Creating configuration files during setup or updates is normal behavior, so this doesn't raise concerns.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe also sets a registry value. Again, ApplicationFrameHost is a legitimate Windows process related to the application frame in desktops and UWP apps. Registry modifications here are standard and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, Calculator.exe setting another registry value. Since it's already been seen doing normal things, this isn't alarming unless there's an unusual pattern. But one instance doesn't make a red flag.\n\nNow, powershell.exe comes up multiple times. PowerShell is powerful but commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The first event shows it accessing something (ProcessAccess), which could be part of normal scripting or administration. However, the presence of whoami.exe later might be a sign, as it's often used to check user privileges.\n\nWhoami.exe being executed directly from C:\\Windows\\system32 is normal if it's just querying the current user. But in this case, there's no indication of any command-line arguments beyond the basic execution path. Still, combining it with powershell could hint at potential scripting or privilege checks.\n\nThe batch has multiple events where chrome.exe is setting registry values and loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard operations for Chrome to interact with Windows components and antivirus software respectively. While excessive registry writes can sometimes indicate issues, they're common in many legitimate processes, especially browsers.\n\nThere's also another powershell.exe event accessing a process, which again could be part of normal admin tasks or scripting. Without more context on the commands run, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nOverall, each individual event doesn't stand out as malicious. However, the frequency of registry modifications by chrome.exe and the use of powershell.exe and whoami.exe together might warrant closer inspection. There could be a legitimate reason for these actions, like system administration or software updates, but there's also enough activity to suggest potential investigation is needed.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this constitutes an attack, but given the combination of multiple processes making registry changes and using powershell, which can be tools for attackers, it might be worth looking into further. The confidence isn't too high because each event on its own isn't suspicious, but together they create a bit of uncertainty.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, along with whoami.exe execution.
