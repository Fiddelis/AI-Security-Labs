{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the batch of events provided. There are multiple JSON objects, each representing a log event. My task is to analyze all these together to determine if they're interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. Process Create events for \"winlogbeat.exe\" and \"powershell.exe\". These seem normal; many processes create logs when starting.\n2. There are several Image Load events from both winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. This is also typical behavior for running applications.\n3. A File created event by winlogbeat.exe in its own directoryâ€”probably logging data or configuration files, which is standard.\n\nThen I notice the PowerShell-related activities:\n\n- Creation of a temporary script file \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1\".\n- The same script is deleted shortly after being created.\n- Multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from PowerShell, which can be part of normal operation or scripts.\n\nConsidering potential malicious behavior: Deleting a newly created script file might indicate an attempt to remove evidence, but it's also possible that the script self-deletes upon execution. However, in this case, the script creation and deletion happen within the same process (powershell.exe), so it might be part of a legitimate check or automated task.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity like multiple failed attempts, unusual file paths, or access to restricted resources. The events are consistent with normal system processes, especially if winlogbeat is being used for log management and powershell is running scripts as part of administration tasks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there are some interesting points (like the script creation\/deletion), they don't strongly indicate malicious behavior when viewed in context. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process creations and file operations, including powershell.exe running scripts that self-delete, which is not unusual.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I'm dealing with here. The user provided three Windows log events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst event: It's a Process Create event for ipconfig.exe running as C:\\Windows\\system32\\ipconfig.exe \/all. That seems normal because ipconfig is a standard tool used by admins or users to check network settings. No red flags here unless it's being run in an unusual context, but there's no indication of that.\n\nSecond event: Process accessed for powershell.exe. Powershell can be both legitimate and malicious. But on its own, just accessing it isn't suspicious. It could be any number of normal tasks since PowerShell is widely used.\n\nThird event: File created by winlogbeat.exe at a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool related to log management, possibly part of the Fidelis product given the path location. Creating configuration files during setup is typical and not concerning unless it's modifying existing critical files without reason.\n\nPutting them together: All three events look routine. No signs of unusual process creation, file access that shouldn't happen, or modifications to sensitive areas. There's no indication of malicious behavior across these logs. So the batch isn't particularly interesting for an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including running ipconfig.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are legitimate processes. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
