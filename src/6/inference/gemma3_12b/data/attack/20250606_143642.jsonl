{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows a significant amount of PowerShell activity, indicating a potential malicious script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and the potential risks:\n\n**Summary of Actions & Interpretation:**\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Script Execution:** A PowerShell script was executed using `powershell.exe`. The initial command includes complex obfuscation and likely has multiple phases (identified by the complex command line used).\n\n2. **File Deletion of Test Script:** After the PowerShell script was running, a file was deleted. `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is highly suspicious, likely a test script to bypass PowerShell execution policies.  This script, along with the way it's structured and deleted, is a clear red flag for malicious intent.\n\n3. **File Access & Deletion (Critical):** The script deletes itself immediately after running, a common tactic used by attackers to avoid detection and analysis.  This deletion is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The filename also implies the script was testing the PowerShell execution policy.\n\n4. **DLL Loading (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.dll):** These are core .NET Framework libraries.  Their presence is normal for PowerShell, which frequently uses .NET for its functionality. However, their loading confirms the script utilizes .NET for its operation. The loading of `mscoreei.dll` and the various Mscorlib DLLs are common when running PowerShell scripts that leverage .NET.\n\n5. **Windows Defender DLL Loading (MpOAV.dll):** This DLL is related to Windows Defender's Platform components. Its loading could indicate the script is attempting to interact with or disable Defender's functionalities.  However, this can also be a false positive depending on the script's functionality.\n\n**Red Flags & Indicators of Compromise:**\n\n* **Obfuscated PowerShell Command:** The complexity of the initial PowerShell command, with seemingly random characters and complex structures, strongly suggests obfuscation to evade detection.\n* **Self-Deletion:** The rapid deletion of the script file is a classic tactic used by attackers.\n* **PowerShell Execution Policy Testing:** The file name indicates a possible attempt to bypass PowerShell restrictions.\n* **.NET Framework Dependency:**  Utilizing .NET framework, a common technique for PowerShell malware.\n* **Windows Defender Interaction:**  The load of Defender DLLs suggests a potential effort to interfere with security mechanisms.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation of the malware.\n2. **Run a Full Antivirus Scan:** Perform a full antivirus scan with updated signatures. Consider using multiple scanners for better coverage.\n3. **Analyze the PowerShell Script (if possible):** Try to recover the deleted PowerShell script (though this is difficult and might require forensic tools). Analyze the script to understand its purpose and identify any further malicious activities.\n4. **Check PowerShell Execution Policy:** Review the PowerShell execution policy settings on the system to ensure they are configured securely.\n5. **Review System Logs:** Examine system logs and event viewer for other signs of compromise.\n6. **Reset Credentials:** Reset passwords for all user accounts that may have been compromised.\n7. **Reimage the System (Highly Recommended):** Given the severity of the indicators, the most reliable way to ensure complete removal is to reimage the system from a known good source.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Recovery:** If the script was intended to delete or encrypt data, attempt data recovery as soon as possible (ideally before reimaging).\n* **Forensic Investigation:**  Engage a cybersecurity professional to conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise and identify the attack vector.\n\n\n\nThis situation warrants immediate action.  Treat this as a serious security incident."}
