The scripts reference non-existent files (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'), which might be an attempt to obscure the actual payload or test the environment.  Furthermore, numerous registry modifications and process creations by `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `svchost.exe` warrant investigation.  The creation of scheduled tasks (`win32times`) is concerning, especially given the PowerShell execution within those tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
