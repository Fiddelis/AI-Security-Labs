Notably, there are repeated `NetworkConnect` events associated with `chrome.exe`, a process accessed by `powershell.exe`, commands executed via `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` to create and start services (using unusual paths and filenames), and several registry modifications linked to `services.exe`. The use of `sc.exe` to create services and subsequent modifications to registry values are strong indicators of persistence mechanisms being implemented. The presence of DLLs loaded by various executables (mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll) might indicate use of .NET for malicious purpose.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
