These tasks are being scheduled on logon and startup and execute `calc.exe`. The use of `schtasks` combined with command line arguments to create scheduled tasks, especially with unusual names, and the repetition of task creation events, is a common indicator of potential malicious activity (e.g., persistence mechanisms, unauthorized privilege escalation). The execution of 'calc.exe' might be a decoy or a further stage of a larger attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
