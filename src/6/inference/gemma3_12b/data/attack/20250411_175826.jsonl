The use of unusual file paths (e.g., containing 'registro_logico', 'modulo_logico', 'unidade_logico') strongly suggests reconnaissance or data manipulation activity. Furthermore, the repeated modification of file timestamps across multiple events to 01\/01\/1970 is a clear indicator of potential tampering and is a common tactic used to obscure file modification times.
