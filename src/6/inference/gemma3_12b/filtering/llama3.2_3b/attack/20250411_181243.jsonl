The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file is also noteworthy. These activities strongly suggest reconnaissance or initial access attempts, warranting further investigation. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' entries for the same command line suggest a potential issue with the logging process, but does not reduce the overall suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
