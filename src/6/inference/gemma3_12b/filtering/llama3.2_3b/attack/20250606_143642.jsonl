{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a fascinating log of malicious activity! Here's a breakdown of what's happening, along with some interpretations and potential severity assessments.  I've broken it down into phases and then given an overall summary with severity levels.\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Download & Decompression (Likely the start of the attack)**\n\n* **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`**:  This is likely the immediate entry point. The command shows that PowerShell is running and providing a \"final result\" of '1'. It is being executed in a restricted execution policy which suggests an attempt to bypass security. This is a critical indicator.\n\n* **`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`**: This PowerShell command is *very* suspicious. It's attempting to delete a ZIP archive named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory.  The `-Force` flag indicates it's forcefully deleting the file, even if write protection or other restrictions apply. This suggests the attacker is attempting to remove traces of their payload.  **Severity: Critical** (Cleanup behavior indicates malicious intent)\n\n**Phase 2:  PowerShell Execution and System Interactions**\n\n* **`powershell.exe`**: The continued PowerShell commands indicate ongoing script execution.\n* **`whoami.exe`**:  A simple `whoami` command is executed. It's likely being used to gather information about the current user's identity and privileges.  Less concerning on its own, but part of a larger pattern. **Severity: Low**\n* **`powershell.exe` (Creating\/Modifying Files and Registry):** Several PowerShell commands are creating, deleting, and modifying files and the registry.\n* **`powershell.exe` (Image Loading):** The loading of DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.) indicates that the PowerShell script is leveraging .NET Framework. This is common for many PowerShell-based attacks.\n* **`powershell.exe` (File Delete):** `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is deleted. Another attempt to erase traces. **Severity: High**\n* **PowerShell & Registry Modifications:** The registry value set is likely intended to further the attacker's objectives â€“ potentially modifying system behavior or persistence mechanisms. **Severity: High**\n\n**Phase 3:  Persistence and System Activity (Likely Attempted)**\n\n* **`powershell.exe` (Creating\/Modifying Files and Registry):** The creation of `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` is *extremely* concerning. This script is trying to modify the PowerShell startup profile. This is a persistence technique to ensure the malware runs every time the user logs in or the system starts.  **Severity: Critical** (Persistence attempt - Very dangerous)\n* **`powershell.exe` (Image loaded):**  Loading DLLs like `MpClient.dll` suggests the script *may* be interacting with Windows Defender to evade detection or mask activity.\n\n**Overall Summary and Severity Assessment**\n\nThis is a **highly malicious** attack. Here's a breakdown of the severity levels, based on the techniques observed:\n\n* **Critical (Highest Severity - Immediate Action Required):**\n    * **Persistence attempts:** Modifying PowerShell startup profile.\n    * **Cleanup behavior:** Deleting ZIP archive and PowerShell scripts.\n    * **Bypassing security:** Executing PowerShell in restricted execution policy.\n* **High (Significant Risk - Prompt Investigation Required):**\n    * Registry modifications.\n    *  Deleting PowerShell scripts `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` (cleanup behavior)\n    * Potential interaction\/evasion attempts of Windows Defender\n* **Low (Monitor and Investigate Further):**\n    * `whoami.exe` execution (information gathering)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Isolate the system immediately.** Disconnect it from the network to prevent further communication and potential spread.\n2. **Run a full system scan:** Use reputable antivirus\/anti-malware tools. Consider offline scanning.\n3. **Review PowerShell Execution Policy:**  Check your system's PowerShell execution policy settings.\n4. **Examine Scheduled Tasks:** Look for any suspicious scheduled tasks that might be executing PowerShell scripts.\n5. **Analyze Registry Changes:**  Carefully review the registry changes made by the attacker.\n6. **Restore from Backup:** If possible, restore the system from a known clean backup.\n7. **Investigate the source:**  Determine how this malicious PowerShell script was introduced to the system. It could have come from a phishing email, a malicious website, or a compromised software package."}
