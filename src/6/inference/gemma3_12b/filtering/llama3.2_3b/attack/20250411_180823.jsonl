Multiple instances of chrome.exe making network connections, along with schtasks.exe being used to create scheduled tasks executing cmd.exe with calc.exe, and the creation of files in the Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks directory by svchost.exe, are concerning. The use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe, combined with file creations and scheduled task modifications, suggests potential malicious intent, possibly related to persistence or lateral movement.
