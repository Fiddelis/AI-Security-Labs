This indicates a potential attempt to escalate privileges and establish persistence. Other activity includes repeated PowerShell access and unusual command line activity with `whoami.exe`. While some events are benign (e.g., Chrome and Calculator), the combination strongly suggests a targeted attack or intrusion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
