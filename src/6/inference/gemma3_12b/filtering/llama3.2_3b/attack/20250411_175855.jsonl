Repeated registry modifications and process access events also suggest potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` creating a new configuration file is also noteworthy and could indicate log tampering. While some actions appear benign (e.g., `calc.exe`, chrome), the combination of these events warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
