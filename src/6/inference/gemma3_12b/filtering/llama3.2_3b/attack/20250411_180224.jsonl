The tasks are created with system privileges and attempt to run potentially malicious PowerShell code (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1` and `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`). The use of `-ep bypass` in the PowerShell command is a significant red flag, as it disables execution policy. Although some logs seem related to Winlogbeat and Chrome, the scheduled task creation stands out as a primary concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
