This pattern strongly suggests potential keylogging activity. The creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script policy test file further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, several DLLs related to .NET, Windows Defender, and URL processing are loaded by PowerShell, which is consistent with malicious PowerShell behavior.
