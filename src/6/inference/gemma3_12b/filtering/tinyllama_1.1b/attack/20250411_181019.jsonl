This strongly suggests an attempt at persistence or malicious script execution.  The unusual command line for `cmd.exe` and subsequent cleanup using `sc qc` are concerning. Other events like `RegistryEvent` and `ProcessAccess` involving standard system processes further contribute to the potential for malicious activity. Chrome's image loading of AMSI and Windows Defender DLLs indicate an attempt to evade detection, but does not definitively confirm malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
