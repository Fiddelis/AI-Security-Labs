The multiple `certutil` invocations and the presence of `powershell.exe` further suggest potential script execution or command-line tool abuse. Additionally, `SDXHelper.exe` and DLL image loading are noteworthy, and the high volume of registry modifications warrant closer inspection. While some entries relate to `winlogbeat` and `chrome.exe`, the combination of unusual process execution and file manipulation raises significant security concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
