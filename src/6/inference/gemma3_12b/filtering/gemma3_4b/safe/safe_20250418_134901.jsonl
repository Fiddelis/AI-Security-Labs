{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the logs, categorized by process and highlighting potential areas of interest:\n\n**1. Winlogbeat (Configuration\/Log Management):**\n\n*   **Multiple `File Created` Events:** Shows winlogbeat creating a configuration file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) multiple times. This might suggest a script running which modifies the configuration. This is normal for initial setup.\n\n**2. Notepad.exe (Text Editor):**\n\n*   **Image loaded** - This means the file is read into memory\n*   **Registry Value Set** - Notepad might be changing system-level settings.\n\n**3. Chrome.exe (Web Browser):**\n\n*   **Dns Query:**  Shows Chrome making DNS requests. This is normal browser activity.\n*   **Registry Value Set (Repeated):** Indicates Chrome is writing to the registry repeatedly.  This could be normal browser behavior, extensions modifying settings, or potentially something more suspicious. Monitoring the specific keys being changed would provide more clarity.\n\n**4. Svchost.exe (Service Host Process):**\n\n*   **Registry Value Set (Repeated):** A large number of registry modifications.  Svchost hosts many Windows services, so this is *expected* to some degree, but the volume needs to be assessed based on your baseline.  If the rate or the specific keys being changed seem unusual, investigate further.\n*   **Registry Object Added or Deleted:**  Indicates a registry key or value was created or removed.\n\n**5. Calculator.exe:**\n\n*   **Registry Value Set** - Calculator is likely changing system-level settings.\n\n**6. Smartscreen.exe:**\n\n*  **Image loaded** - Indicates that smartscreen is being initialized\n\n**7. Taskhostw.exe:**\n\n* **Image loaded** - Likely related to the execution of scheduled tasks.\n\n**8. Setup.exe:**\n\n*  **File Created** - Indicates that an installer is running\n\n**Potential Areas for Further Investigation:**\n\n*   **Chrome Registry Changes:**  The large number of Chrome registry changes warrant closer inspection.  Identify *which* keys are being modified.  This could pinpoint extensions or malware.\n*   **Svchost Registry Changes:**  Determine if the rate of these changes or the keys being changed are within a normal range for your environment.  Establish a baseline first.\n*   **Repeated Configuration File Creation:**  While likely benign, the configuration file creation by winlogbeat could be linked to scripts or automated processes. Determine which process is doing it.\n*   **User Account Management Events:** These usually come from the login process.\n\nTo give more specific analysis, I'd need more context:\n\n*   **What's the purpose of these logs?** (Security monitoring, auditing, troubleshooting?)\n*   **What are your expected behaviors for these processes?**  (What's \"normal\" for your environment?)\n*   **What security tools or policies are in place?**"}
