Notably, a new file 'entrada_logico.txt' is created by PowerShell, which warrants further investigation as it could indicate malicious code or data being written. The repetitive creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` may be related to the log agent configuration, but the multiple PowerShell events alongside the new file are concerning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
