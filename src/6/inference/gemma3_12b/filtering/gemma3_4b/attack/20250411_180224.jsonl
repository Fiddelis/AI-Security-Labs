These scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which could be an attempt to evade detection or hide malicious intent.  The repetitive use of `schtasks.exe` to create tasks with seemingly random names like `win32times` combined with the PowerShell script creation is highly suspicious. While other processes like `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` are present, the scheduled task creation and PowerShell execution patterns stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
