This strongly suggests a potential obfuscation or malicious payload delivery technique, possibly using `certutil` to encode and decode files. The presence of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` further indicate potential scripting or command-line exploitation attempts.  Several `certutil` entries are also creating and modifying files in the user's temporary directory.
