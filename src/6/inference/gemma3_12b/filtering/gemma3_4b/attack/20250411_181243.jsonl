The repeated enumeration attempts, especially involving the `net` command (and the suspicious 'net1.exe'), combined with attempts to list credentials (`cmdkey.exe \/list`), strongly suggest reconnaissance or credential harvesting activity. The `powershell` executions show an attempt to retrieve local users and group memberships. The creation of files in different locations (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`, `elemento_logico.txt`, and StartupProfileData), the registry event, and execution of `net1.exe` (which may not be a standard utility) further increase the suspicion. Winlogbeat installation and configuration is observed, which could be legitimate, but in this context, combined with the suspicious enumeration activity, warrants closer inspection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
