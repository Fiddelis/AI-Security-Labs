{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and look for any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common setup for logbeat, maybe just normal configuration. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe events. Process accessed, image loaded, etc. The image loads include some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, which are normal for PowerShell, but there's also MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal too, but maybe not.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up. Also, the file name has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be related to testing script policies, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries for Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks related to PowerShell. Maybe just normal operations, but combined with the file creation\/deletion, it's more concerning. Also, ssh.exe is creating a known_hosts file, which is normal for SSH, but the network connection detected might be okay if it's a legitimate SSH connection.\n\nThe repeated events from winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file could be part of configuration, but if it's happening multiple times, maybe there's some issue. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell activity with the temp file. The combination of file creation, deletion, and the image loads might indicate something malicious trying to execute and hide its tracks.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.75. There are some suspicious patterns but not definitive proof. Need to check if the temp file was malicious, but the logs don't show the content. Still, the behavior is worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, frequent image loading of system DLLs, and repeated Provider\/Engine Lifecycle events. These patterns may indicate script-based attacks or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look at these logs. Both events are about files being created in the XboxLive directory under the systemprofile's AppData. The process is svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, but it's often used by malware to hide. The files created are AuthStateCache.dat. Hmm, normally, Xbox Live related files might be part of legitimate operations, but creating files in the systemprofile's AppData could be suspicious. However, since svchost.exe is a common host process, maybe this is just part of normal system operations. I should check if there are any other indicators of compromise. But with just these two events, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity. The classification might be interesting, but the confidence should be low because it's not conclusive. Maybe the justification is that the files are in a non-standard location for XboxLive, but without more context, it's hard to say. So I'll go with INTERESTING but low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"svchost.exe creating files in non-standard locations (systemprofile\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\XboxLive) may indicate potential malicious activity, though further context is needed to confirm.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
