So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes mentioned. There's RuntimeBroker.exe, which is normal.

The events related to ProcessAccess and Registry value changes might be normal, but I should check for any unusual patterns.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events: calc.exe and Calculator.exe are loading urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. The correct name is calc.exe. Maybe that's a typo, but maybe it's a renamed malicious executable. Also, urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected place or by an unusual process, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which isn't typical for system processes. Maybe someone is trying to tamper with the configuration.\n\nThe cmd.exe command line has a wmic command to delete notepad.exe processes. That's unusual. Deleting processes isn't normal, and using wmic in that way could be part of a malicious script. Also, the command is run with \/c, which is used to execute a command and then terminate, which is common in attacks.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe being used with the command to delete notepad.exe. That's another suspicious activity. WMIC is often used in attacks for executing commands remotely. The ImageLoad events for WMIC.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But if these are being loaded by WMIC, that might be a sign of evasion techniques, trying to bypass detection by using legitimate DLLs.\n\nAlso, multiple Registry value set events by svchost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. svchost is a normal host process, but excessive registry changes could indicate something is wrong.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being executed. That's common, but sometimes these can be used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. \n\nLooking at the 'cmd.exe' entries, one of them has a command line: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". Wait, that's suspicious. The 'sethc.exe' is the Sticky Keys executable, and replacing it with a backup file might be part of a malicious attempt, like a backdoor. \n\nAnother 'cmd.exe' entry has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". Deleting a scheduled task might be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent a task from running. Also, there's a 'schtasks.exe' process with the command line \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". That's the same task being deleted. \n\nThen there's a 'conhost.exe' and 'svchost.exe' with registry events. Registry changes can be a sign of persistence mechanisms. The 'whoami.exe' commands are just checking the user, which is normal, but combined with other activities might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe 'powershell.exe' processes are frequently accessing and modifying the registry. While PowerShell is a common tool, excessive registry modifications could indicate something malicious. \n\nPutting this all together, the combination of modifying system files like sethc.exe, deleting scheduled tasks, and multiple registry changes by PowerShell and cmd.exe suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are normal, the specific commands and the frequency of events point towards an investigation being needed. \n\nI should check if there are any other red flags. The 'Image loaded' event for 'taskschd.dll' is normal, but the deletion of the task might be part of covering tracks. \n\nConfidence-wise, the presence of the sethc.exe replacement and task deletion is strong indicators, so I'd say around 0.8 confidence.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first few events mention chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading that from System32 seems normal, but MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender as well. However, the path here is in ProgramData, which might be a red flag if it's not the expected location. But I need to check if that's standard.\n\nThen there are several events with cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe performing registry value sets and process accesses. A lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is common but can be suspicious if there's a lot of it. The command lines for whoami.exe and powershell are standard, but the repeated process accesses and registry changes might indicate something.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1. That seems like a temporary file created by PowerShell for script testing. But the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be part of a legitimate test, but in some contexts, it could be a sign of malicious activity if it's unexpected.\n\nNow, the key points: The first two events involve chrome.exe loading DLLs from Windows Defender paths. That could be normal if the system is using Defender. However, if those DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations or if there's a high volume, it might be suspicious. The rest of the events show a lot of registry changes and process accesses, particularly from PowerShell. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The presence of multiple registry value sets might indicate attempts to modify system settings, which could be part of an attack.\n\nAlso, the file created in Temp is a PowerShell script. While creating temporary files is normal, if this is part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it might be a sign of something. However, without more context like the script's content or other indicators, it's hard to say. \n\nBut looking at the overall picture, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The Chrome loading of Defender DLLs might be normal, but the high number of registry changes and PowerShell activity could be indicative of an investigation-worthy scenario. However, since the user's system might be using PowerShell for legitimate tasks, I need to be cautious. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. On one hand, the volume of events and the types (registry changes, process accesses) could be part of a benign process. On the other, if these events are not part of a known legitimate process, they might be suspicious. But without more data, like the presence of other malicious indicators (like network connections, unusual file modifications), it's hard to confirm. \n\nGiven that, the batch has some potentially suspicious elements but not conclusive evidence of a threat. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and PowerShell activity might warrant further investigation. Therefore, the answer is likely \"interesting\" but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity** that may warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`:**  \n     These are legitimate Windows Defender components. `amsi.dll` is part of the Antimalware Scan Interface, and `MpOAV.dll` is part of the Windows Defender Antivirus engine. Loading these from expected paths (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`, `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform`) is normal.\n\n   - **PowerShell script creation in Temp directory:**  \n     The file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` is likely a temporary file created during a **PowerShell script policy test** (e.g., testing execution policies). This is a common legitimate use case.\n\n2. **Potentially Suspicious Activity:**\n   - **High volume of registry changes and process accesses:**  \n     Multiple events involving `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` modifying registry keys or accessing processes could indicate **system configuration changes** or **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation).\n\n   - **PowerShell loading .NET Framework DLLs:**  \n     While loading `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) is normal for PowerShell execution, the **repeated loading of these DLLs** could suggest **unusual execution patterns** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, code injection).\n\n   - **File creation in Temp directory:**  \n     While temporary files are common, the filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` may be a **red flag** if it is not part of a known legitimate process or if it is associated with unexpected behavior (e.g., hidden malicious scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **not definitively malicious**, but it contains **indicators that could be associated with benign or malicious activity**. The **high volume of registry changes**, **PowerShell activity**, and **temporary file creation** may warrant further investigation to determine if these events are part of a **legitimate system process** or a **potential security incident** (e.g., script-based attacks, lateral movement, or persistence).\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Correlate these events with **network traffic logs**, **user behavior**, and **process tree analysis** to identify context (e.g., is the PowerShell activity related to a known legitimate task?).  \n- Check for **unusual execution policies** (e.g., `Bypass` or `RemoteSigned`) and **script content** in the Temp directory.  \n- Monitor for **recurring patterns** of registry modifications or PowerShell usage that deviate from baseline behavior.  \n\n**Final Classification:**  \n**Interesting for investigation** — not conclusively malicious, but requires deeper analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about a file deletion in the Temp directory by PowerShell. That's a red flag because deleting files, especially in temporary folders, might be part of cleanup after malicious activity. But then there are a bunch of other events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which seem more routine. \n\nWait, there's also a file creation by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be normal. But then there's a PowerShell process checking for the existence of several .bat files in various paths. The paths have some odd directory structures with \"..\\\" which might indicate navigating up directories, possibly trying to access files outside the intended scope. \n\nThe repeated PowerShell commands checking for these .bat files could be part of a script trying to locate specific files, maybe to execute them. However, the exit codes (0 or 1) based on Test-Path might just be a benign check. But combined with the file deletion in the Temp directory, it raises suspicion. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any actual malicious activity. The majority of the logs are PowerShell commands that don't show obvious malicious intent. The file deletion is a single event, and the rest are lifecycle events. The multiple checks for .bat files might be part of a legitimate script, but the paths are a bit suspicious. \n\nOn the other hand, without seeing any actual execution of these .bat files or any other signs of exploitation, it's hard to confirm. The presence of multiple PowerShell activities could be normal, especially if the user is running scripts. But the combination of file deletion and those path checks might be worth investigating further. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there's a mix of file deletion and unusual path checks, even though the evidence isn't conclusive.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a PowerShell process checking if a certain batch file exists. The command line uses Test-Path and exits based on whether the file exists. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script's validation. But then, looking at the subsequent entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes with various tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Image Loaded, File Created, and File Deleted. \n\nThe Image Load events are loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal because PowerShell can use these components, but I should check if there's anything suspicious. The files loaded are all legitimate system files, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately a File Delete event for a temporary script file. That might be part of a normal operation, like a script being written and then cleaned up. However, the fact that it's being created and deleted quickly could be a red flag if it's part of an attempt to hide malicious activity. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for Chrome.exe modifying registry values. That's unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much. However, if the user is using Chrome extensions or certain configurations, it might be normal. But repeated registry changes could indicate something like a browser hijacker or malicious extension.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of multiple PowerShell processes with different command lines. The command lines involve checking paths that have \"..\\\" which might be navigating up directories. However, that's a common way to reference files in scripts. The paths mentioned (like C:\\modulo_ativo, C:\\modulo_logico) don't immediately ring any bells as malicious, but they could be part of a custom application or script.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which is normal in some scenarios. However, if there's a lot of pipe activity that's unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be a red herring. Maybe the process is interacting with Defender, but that's not necessarily bad. However, if the process is trying to bypass Defender, that would be a concern. But the logs don't show any signs of that.\n\nPutting it all together: there are multiple PowerShell activities, some registry changes by Chrome, and normal system DLLs being loaded. The key points are the repeated registry changes by Chrome and the PowerShell scripts checking for specific batch files. If these batch files are part of legitimate operations, then it's normal. However, if those batch files are being used to execute malicious code or if the PowerShell scripts are part of a larger attack chain, then it's suspicious.\n\nBut based solely on the logs provided, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity. The events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, registry changes by Chrome, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files might warrant further investigation to rule out any potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **normal system operations** with **no clear indicators of malicious activity**, but there are **notable patterns** that merit further investigation to rule out potential threats. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute scripts that check for the existence of specific `.bat` files using `Test-Path`. These scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on the file's presence. \n   - **Context**: This is a common pattern in **legitimate automation** (e.g., pre-flight checks, dependency validation). However, the use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\pacote_temporario\\...`) could hint at **directory traversal**, which is sometimes used in attacks to bypass path restrictions.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. This is typical for **PowerShell profile initialization** or **cleanup routines**. However, rapid creation\/deletion of files in non-standard locations (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`) could be a **red flag** if linked to **malicious payload execution**.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads DLLs from **legitimate system paths** (e.g., `.NET Framework`, `Windows Defender`). This is expected behavior for PowerShell's execution model. However, the presence of **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) might indicate **interaction with antivirus components**, which is not inherently suspicious but warrants scrutiny if combined with other anomalies.\n\n4. **Chrome Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` are **unusual**. Chrome typically does not modify the registry extensively unless **extensions or policies** are involved. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious extensions** (e.g., hijackers, data stealers).\n     - **Policy enforcement** by an administrator.\n     - **Legitimate configuration changes** (e.g., custom settings).\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `Pipe Created` event by PowerShell is **normal** for inter-process communication (IPC) but could be exploited in **malware communication channels** if paired with other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**:\n- **Unusual Chrome Behavior**: The repeated registry modifications by Chrome may point to **malicious activity** (e.g., extension tampering) or **misconfigured policies**.\n- **PowerShell Scripting Patterns**: While the scripts themselves are benign, the **reliance on file existence checks** and **non-standard paths** could be part of a **larger attack chain** (e.g., checking for payloads, evading detection).\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional logs (e.g., network activity, process tree, file content), it's challenging to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate Chrome Registry Changes**:\n   - Check Chrome extensions, policies, and logs for unauthorized modifications.\n   - Use tools like **Chrome Cleanup Tool** or **Malwarebytes** to scan for suspicious extensions.\n\n2. **Audit PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Analyze the content of the `.bat` files referenced in the scripts (if accessible) to confirm their purpose.\n   - Monitor PowerShell execution using **ScriptBlock logging** or **PowerShell transcripts**.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Use **EDR\/XDR tools** to correlate these events with network traffic, process behavior, and user activity.\n   - Look for **unusual process relationships** (e.g., PowerShell spawning suspicious child processes).\n\n4. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Verify the integrity of the `.bat` files and temporary scripts using **hashing tools** or **anti-malware scanners**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **not inherently malicious** but exhibit **patterns that could indicate benign or malicious activity**. Further investigation is required to confirm legitimacy, especially focusing on **Chrome registry changes** and **PowerShell scripting context**. If these events are part of a **known legitimate workflow**, no action is needed. Otherwise, **malicious activity cannot be ruled out**."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain activities, it can be suspicious. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process Create, Process accessed, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nOne event stands out: the third entry has a command_line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create and modify batch files. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, the first path is \"C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_base\\\\componente_temporario_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" suggests that the script is creating files in parent directories, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path or to write files in unexpected locations. \n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, and while they are legitimate, the fact that they're being loaded by PowerShell could be part of a malicious payload, especially if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThen there are several entries with the Provider Lifecycle task. The command_lines here are similar, creating new items and setting content in various paths. The repetition of these commands across different directories might indicate a pattern, possibly part of a script that's trying to create multiple files in different locations, which could be a sign of persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe File created event at the end is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but the filename \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1\" might be related to script execution. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes creating files in various directories, using paths with parent references, loading .NET DLLs, and repeated commands that could be part of a larger script. These activities, while not definitively malicious, are suspicious and warrant further investigation. The combination of these events increases the likelihood that this is an interesting case for a security analyst to look into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates activity that warrants further investigation due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands to:\n     - **Create files** (`New-Item`) and **write content** (`Set-Content`) to batch files (`*.bat`) across non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\pacote_base\\componente_temporario_script.bat`).\n     - The use of `..` in file paths suggests **path obfuscation**, potentially to evade detection or hide the true location of created files.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation:**\n   - A file is created in the **Windows Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`). While temporary files are normal, the filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` may hint at **script execution** or **policy testing**, which could be part of malicious activity (e.g., testing for script execution restrictions).\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loads:**\n   - Multiple **Image Load events** involve .NET Framework DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.). While legitimate, these could indicate **.NET-based payloads** being executed via PowerShell, which is a common technique in attacks (e.g., obfuscated scripts or payloads).\n\n4. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Repeated `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events with PowerShell commands may indicate **automated or persistent scripting**, possibly for **data exfiltration**, **registry manipulation**, or **malware persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The **combination of PowerShell scripting**, **file creation in non-standard paths**, and **.NET DLL loading** is a red flag for **malicious activity** (e.g., post-exploitation, persistence, or data collection).\n- The repetition of similar commands across different directories suggests a **pattern**, possibly part of a **larger script or attack chain**.\n- The use of `..` in file paths may be an attempt to **obfuscate** the true intent of the script.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze the Created Files:**\n   - Check the contents of the batch files (e.g., `componente_temporario_script.bat`) and the Temp file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) for malicious code or obfuscation.\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Look for **network activity**, **registry changes**, or **process injections** around the same time.\n3. **Check User Context:**\n   - Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or access to sensitive systems.\n4. **Yara Rules\/Signature Matching:**\n   - Use the observed patterns (e.g., file paths, DLLs, PowerShell commands) to check for known malicious signatures.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs exhibits **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malicious activity** (e.g., post-exploitation, persistence, or data exfiltration). Further analysis is required to confirm whether this is an attack or a false positive. **Investigation is recommended.** \n\n**Risk Level:** High (Potential compromise)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like File Delete, Pipe Created, File Created, Image Loaded, and Registry value set. There's also some Process Create and Process Access events. The files being created or deleted are in temporary directories or specific paths like AppData, but some are in more system-like locations. \n\nWait, one of the image loads is for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably normal. But there are multiple image loads for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so again, normal for PowerShell running scripts.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of Test-Path commands checking if certain files exist. The paths have patterns like \"C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..\\\" which might be trying to access parent directories. But the actual files being checked don't seem to be malicious. The scripts created are named things like \"componente_secundario_script.bat\" and have simple commands like \"dir\". \n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple file creations and deletions in temporary directories, along with registry changes, might indicate some automated script activity. But since the commands are basic and the files are in expected locations, maybe this is part of a legitimate process. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the combination of all events. The repeated use of PowerShell for file operations, registry changes, and image loads could be part of a larger script or tool. However, without more context like unexpected processes, network activity, or unusual commands, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here might be moderate. It's not clearly malicious, but there's enough activity that could be part of something suspicious. However, since all the actions are within normal PowerShell operations and the files are in standard locations, it might just be a legitimate script. So, maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious, but warrants further investigation. However, the assistant's initial answer was \"Not interesting\" with low confidence. Maybe the key point is that the activities are all within normal PowerShell usage, even though there's a lot of them. So, no obvious signs of malware or attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Not interesting  \n**Confidence:** Low  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe events primarily involve standard PowerShell operations (file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and .NET assembly loading) in typical system directories (e.g., `AppData`, `Windows\\assembly`). While there are multiple file operations and registry changes, none of the commands or paths indicate malicious behavior (e.g., no suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or execution of harmful payloads). The scripts created (e.g., `*.bat` files) contain benign commands like `dir`, and the use of `Test-Path` is consistent with legitimate script logic. No anomalies or indicators of compromise (IoCs) are present.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The activity appears to be part of normal system or application behavior, likely related to automated scripting or configuration tasks. No immediate threat is detected."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each event and see what's going on. Most of these entries are about PowerShell processes. Let me check the command lines. There's a pattern here: multiple instances of PowerShell running scripts that check if a certain file exists, then exit 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like \"C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\...\" and similar variations. \n\nHmm, the fact that there are so many Test-Path commands checking for different files might be a red flag. Normally, PowerShell scripts that check for the existence of files could be part of legitimate processes, but when there are multiple such checks across different paths, it might indicate something like a fileless attack or probing for specific files. \n\nAlso, looking at the winlog tasks, there's a mix of things like \"Provider Lifecycle,\" \"Image loaded,\" \"File created,\" \"File Delete logged,\" \"Pipe Created,\" etc. Some of these are normal, like image loading (which could be part of Defender), but the repeated Test-Path commands with different paths might be suspicious. \n\nWait, there's also a whoami.exe process, which is just a normal command to get user info, so that's probably benign. The winlogbeat file creation seems like a legitimate download and setup. But the PowerShell activities are more concerning. \n\nNow, the key here is the repetition. If an attacker is trying to check for the presence of certain files, maybe they're looking for specific executables that could be part of a payload or a dropper. The paths are all in different directories, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by varying the paths. \n\nBut are these just normal checks? Maybe the user is running some scripts that are checking for dependencies. However, the large number of such events (like 13 entries with Test-Path) might be too much. Also, the fact that they're all using PowerShell, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, adds to the suspicion. \n\nI should also check for any anomalies. The events don't show any obvious malicious payloads, but the pattern of checking multiple files could be part of a larger attack. The confidence here might be medium, as it's not a direct attack but suspicious behavior. \n\nSo, the justification would be that there are multiple PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various files across different paths, which could indicate probing or part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Suspicious\",\n  \"justification\": \"The logs show multiple PowerShell processes executing `Test-Path` commands to check for the existence of files across various directories (e.g., `C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\...`, `C:\\\\pacote_principal\\\\...`, etc.).

The absence of obvious malicious content in the command lines makes this a low-confidence alert, but the behavior is still noteworthy for further investigation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several process create, process access, and image load events. The command lines in some of the PowerShell processes are checking if certain files exist, like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\...\" and others. The exit codes are 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script.\n\nThen there are image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. Those are standard for PowerShell when running .NET code, so that's probably normal. Also, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which could be part of temporary script execution. The file names have \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which sounds like it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, maybe a legitimate activity.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is just getting user information, so that's normal. Then a cmd.exe process checking if a file exists in the temp directory. Again, that's a simple existence check, not inherently malicious.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files might be part of a larger operation. The paths mentioned, like \"registro_principal\" and \"objeto_auxiliar,\" don't look like standard Windows directories. They might be custom paths set up by the user or an application, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that multiple checks are being done could indicate that the script is trying to determine the presence of certain executables, which could be part of a setup or a check for dependencies.\n\nAnother thing to note is the loading of Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. This might be part of PowerShell interacting with antivirus components, but again, that's not necessarily malicious. However, if the script is trying to bypass or interact with Defender, that could be a red flag. But the logs don't show any suspicious activity beyond the normal operations.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. The events don't show any clear signs of malware, like downloading files, executing unknown binaries, or network activity. They're mostly PowerShell scripts doing existence checks and temporary file creation. However, the repeated use of PowerShell for these checks, combined with the non-standard paths, might be worth investigating further. It could be a legitimate script, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple registry value sets and process accesses could indicate some configuration changes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, maybe this is a low-risk activity, but it's not entirely benign. The user might want to look into the purpose of these scripts and the files they're checking for. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the behavior is somewhat unusual, I might lean towards \"interesting\" but not necessarily a security threat. So, the answer would be that it's interesting for further investigation but not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a series of activities primarily involving **PowerShell** and **cmd.exe**, with a focus on **file existence checks** and **temporary file operations**. Here's a structured analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` (e.g., checking for files such as `entrada_auxiliar.exe` or `objeto_logico.txt`). These checks are common in scripts that validate dependencies or prerequisites.\n   - The use of temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) and subsequent deletion suggests **ephemeral script execution**, which is typical in legitimate scenarios (e.g., configuration checks, policy testing).\n\n2. **Non-Standard File Paths**:\n   - Paths like `C:\\registro_ativo\\...` or `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...` are not standard Windows directories. While this could indicate custom application logic, it also raises questions about the **origin and purpose** of these files.\n\n3. **Interaction with System Components**:\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are loaded during PowerShell execution. This could be part of **antivirus interaction** or **script sandboxing**, but further context is needed to determine intent.\n   - **Registry modifications** and **process access** events are logged but lack specific details (e.g., keys modified or processes accessed).\n\n4. **cmd.exe Activity**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process checks for the existence of `objeto_logico.txt` in the temp directory. This is a simple, benign operation but could be part of a larger workflow.\n\n5. **Lack of Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No evidence of **file downloads**, **network communication**, **payload execution**, or **exploitation** is present.\n   - The scripts appear to focus on **existence checks** and **temporary file management**, which are common in legitimate scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity**: **Low to Moderate**.\n  - The behavior is **not overtly malicious** but exhibits **unusual patterns** (non-standard paths, repeated PowerShell usage) that warrant closer inspection.\n- **Potential Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - Automated deployment scripts, configuration validation, or application setup workflows.\n  - PowerShell-based policy enforcement or logging mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Purpose of Scripts**:\n   - Determine the **source** of the PowerShell scripts and their **intended function** (e.g., part of a known application, user-initiated, or unauthorized).\n   - Check if the files referenced (e.g., `entrada_auxiliar.exe`) are legitimate and expected.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Track **unusual file creation\/deletion** in temp directories or non-standard paths.\n   - Correlate these events with **network activity** or **user behavior** for context.\n\n3. **Review Registry Changes**:\n   - Investigate **registry keys modified** by PowerShell to identify potential configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Confirm if these activities align with **known legitimate workflows** (e.g., PowerShell-based automation tools) or if they deviate from baseline behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not conclusively indicate malicious activity**, but the **repeated use of PowerShell** for file checks and the **non-standard paths** merit further investigation. This is **interesting for analysis** but not clearly indicative of a security threat at this stage. **Contextual correlation** with other system data (e.g., user activity, network logs) is recommended to determine benignity or risk. \n\n**Classification**: **Interesting for further investigation** (not clearly malicious)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about processes being accessed, specifically powershell.exe. There are multiple instances of 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' and 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'. Also, there's a few 'Registry value set' events. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a favorite tool for attackers. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check if certain files exist. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\entrada_temporario\\\\elemento_base\\\\src\\\\unidade_principal.cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\". These commands are testing for the presence of specific files. But why would someone do that? Maybe they're checking if certain files are in place as part of an installation or setup. However, the paths mentioned don't look like standard system paths. They have directories like 'registro_principal', 'modulo_secundario', which might be custom or part of an application, but the presence of multiple such checks could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that several of the PowerShell processes are loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal when running .NET applications. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a red flag. But in this case, since the processes are PowerShell, which does use .NET, this might be normal behavior.\n\nWait, but there's also a 'Registry value set' event. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate configuration, but if done by an attacker, it might be to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. However, there's only one such event here, so maybe not enough to be conclusive.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are a lot of PowerShell process access events. While PowerShell is common, a high volume of such events could indicate automated scripts or malicious activity. The repeated testing of file paths might be part of a script that's trying to determine the environment or check for the presence of other components. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother point is the 'Provider Lifecycle' events. These might relate to PowerShell providers, which are used to access different data stores. But again, without more information, it's hard to tell if this is normal or not.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes accessing and creating, checking for specific files, and loading .NET components. While some of this is normal, the combination of many events and the specific file path checks might be indicative of something more. However, there's not enough evidence here to confirm malicious activity. It could be a legitimate script or application. But the presence of multiple checks for non-standard files might warrant further investigation. Therefore, this batch is somewhat suspicious and could be interesting for a security team to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Over 20+ entries** involve `powershell.exe`, including `ProcessAccess`, `ProcessCreate`, and `Provider Lifecycle` events. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its frequent use in this context could indicate automation, scripting, or potential exploitation (e.g., for lateral movement or data exfiltration).\n\n2. **File-Path Testing via PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files in **non-standard, custom paths** (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\...`). These paths do not correspond to known system directories or common application locations, raising concerns about:\n     - **Environment probing** (e.g., checking for the presence of specific files or directories).\n     - **Malicious payload deployment** (e.g., checking for dependencies before executing a larger attack).\n\n3. **Registry Modification**:\n   - One event involves a **\"Registry value set\"** action. While registry changes can be legitimate, this is a **low-frequency event** in the logs and could indicate attempts to modify system behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms, configuration tampering).\n\n4. **.NET DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell processes load .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`). While expected in .NET environments, this could also be a **red flag** if the context is unusual or if these DLLs are being loaded from non-standard locations (not explicitly shown here).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File-Path Checks**: The repeated `Test-Path` commands for custom directories may suggest **environment reconnaissance** or **dependency checks** for malicious payloads.\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose**: The absence of context (e.g., no clear application or user intent) makes these activities **ambiguous** and potentially **malicious**.\n- **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**: While not inherently malicious, the **frequency** and **specificity** of these events could indicate **automated scripts** or **exploitation attempts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs is **moderately suspicious** and **deserves further investigation**. Key steps include:\n- **Correlating timestamps** with other security events (e.g., network traffic, user logins).\n- **Analyzing the file paths** for potential connections to known malicious activity or custom applications.\n- **Checking for lateral movement** or **data exfiltration** patterns in associated network logs.\n- **Validating the legitimacy** of the PowerShell commands (e.g., via user interviews or application audits).\n\n**Recommendation**: Flag this activity for deeper analysis by a security team or SOC."}

Those are legitimate files, so maybe that's just normal operation. But then there are other files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Sometimes malware does that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain paths exist. The paths have names like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" which is a common name for scripts that might capture keystrokes, which could be malicious. However, just checking if a file exists doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious. But the repetition of these checks in different directories might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a specific script.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack.

Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks.\n\nThen there are some PowerShell commands checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check if there's anything suspicious there. Then there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes with ProcessAccess events. Multiple times, powershell is accessed, and there's also a ProcessCreate event with a command line that's doing some recursive listing. That could be part of a script, but maybe not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are several NetworkConnect events from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making a lot of network connections might be normal, but svchost could be hosting services that are communicating. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The DnsQuery events from chrome could be normal browsing, but again, depends on the destination.\n\nThe interesting part is the ImageLoad events for powershell.exe. It's loading several DLLs, including ones related to .NET and Windows Defender. The presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but if there's an unexpected version or if these loads are happening in a suspicious context, that could be a red flag. However, in the given data, the paths look legitimate.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess on powershell.exe might indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate the process. Also, the command line in one of the ProcessCreate events shows \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse,\" which are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That could be part of a legitimate script, but if done in a way that's probing the system, it might be a sign of reconnaissance.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious event is the creation of the .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. However, if this is part of a larger pattern where other suspicious activities are happening, like unusual process access or unexpected DLL loads, it could be a sign of something malicious. But on its own, without more context, it's not conclusive. The rest of the events seem to be normal system activities, like Chrome and svchost making network connections, and PowerShell being used for file listing.\n\nSo, the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there's a combination of events that could indicate an investigation is needed, especially the file creation and the multiple process accesses. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because some of these activities could be benign.

That's a legitimate file, so probably nothing to worry about there.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a .yml.new file might be part of configuration changes, which could be normal, but if it's unexpected, maybe not.
