So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a command-line tool that displays the current user's identity. That's not inherently bad, but if it's being used in a context that's unexpected, it could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool, and while it's common for legitimate tasks, it's also often abused by attackers. Looking at the command lines, there's a command that uses \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\" which are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That might be part of normal scripting, but combined with other events, it could indicate something more.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, which is normal. However, the presence of \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender might be a bit odd. Wait, but that's part of the antivirus software, so maybe that's just a legitimate process. But I should check if there's any unusual loading here.\n\nThen there's a File Created event for a temporary PowerShell script file, followed by a File Delete event. Creating and then immediately deleting a script could be part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers do this to avoid leaving traces. However, the filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a test script, possibly legitimate. Still, the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be worth noting.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might relate to PowerShell's internal operations, but the repetition could indicate something automated or scripted. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: multiple PowerShell processes, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting a script file, and the use of commands that recursively list files. This could be part of a legitimate script, but in some contexts, such behavior might be part of an attack, like enumerating the file system to find sensitive information.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any network connections to suspicious IPs, no execution of payloads, no unusual command-line arguments that are typically associated with attacks. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL might even suggest that the system is actively monitoring for threats.\n\nBut the fact that a temporary script is created and deleted, along with the repeated PowerShell commands, might still be considered suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. It's not conclusive, but it's a pattern that could be part of a larger attack chain. Therefore, I think this batch is interesting enough for a security team to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Browser Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe** performing DNS queries and network connections is typical for a browser. No immediate red flags here.\n\n2. **User Enumeration via `whoami.exe`:**\n   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is benign in isolation but could be part of a larger reconnaissance effort if combined with other suspicious actions.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Repetitive Use of `ls -recurse`\/`get-childitem -recurse`:** These commands recursively list files, which could be part of a legitimate script or, in a malicious context, an attempt to gather sensitive information (e.g., searching for credentials, config files).\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. While this could be a test or cleanup, it may also indicate obfuscation tactics (e.g., dropping and removing malicious payloads).\n\n4. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads standard .NET DLLs (e.g., `System.Core.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`), which is normal. However, the presence of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll** might be coincidental or could indicate the system is actively monitoring for threats.\n\n5. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events in PowerShell could indicate automated scripting or module loading, but lack context to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Lifecycle:** The temporary script's creation and deletion may suggest cleanup or obfuscation.\n- **Repetitive PowerShell Commands:** While not inherently malicious, the repetition could hint at automation or exploitation of PowerShell's capabilities (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration).\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The `__PSScriptPolicyTest` filename suggests a test, but without logs of the script's contents or purpose, it remains ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of:\n- PowerShell activity that could be used for reconnaissance or exploitation.\n- A temporary script's lifecycle, which may indicate obfuscation or cleanup.\n- The absence of clear context for the PowerShell commands or script.\n\n**Recommendation:** Further analysis is needed, including:\n- Checking the contents of the deleted script (if possible via timeline analysis or residual artifacts).\n- Correlating these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior, system changes).\n- Assessing whether the PowerShell activity aligns with known benign scripts or known malicious patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are several entries involving PowerShell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I need to check what it's doing here.\n\nLooking at the first event, PowerShell is loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a trusted component. But then there's another event where PowerShell creates a file named 'objeto_principal.txt' in the user's Downloads directory. Creating a file isn't necessarily bad, but I should check if there's any suspicious activity around it.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of PowerShell creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe this is part of a configuration change. However, the fact that it's being created multiple times might be a red flag. Also, there's a registry value set by PowerShell and other processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be part of normal operations, but if they're done by unexpected processes or in a way that modifies critical keys, that's suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the repeated entries for svchost.exe and services.exe with registry events. svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, but multiple registry modifications could indicate something trying to alter system settings. However, without more context on what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThere are also several 'User Account Management' events with no process associated. That might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of account management events, it could point to account manipulation or privilege escalation attempts. However, the events here don't show any direct changes to user accounts, just the task being logged.\n\nThe presence of 'Special Logon' and 'Logon' events might indicate a user login, which is normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some suspicious activities like multiple file creations and registry changes, none of them are immediately pointing to a clear attack vector. The events don't show any direct malicious payloads, network connections to bad domains, or execution of known malware. However, the combination of PowerShell creating files and registry changes might be worth investigating further. But since there's no definitive evidence of malicious activity, I'd classify this as not interesting, but with a note that it's on the borderline. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while there are some red flags, they aren't conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine system activity including PowerShell operations, file creations, and registry modifications typical of normal user and system behavior. No clear indicators of compromise (e.g., suspicious file paths, network connections, or known malicious payloads) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these four events to determine if they're interesting. Let me start by looking at each one.\n\nFirst event: process is calc.exe, winlog task is Image loaded, and the file is urlmon.dll from System32. Wait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows process, and urlmon.dll is part of the system. But why is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll? Maybe normal, but maybe not. Sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to hide.\n\nSecond and third events are svchost.exe with Registry value set. svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Registry changes can be normal, but if there are multiple entries, maybe something's going on. However, without more info, it's hard to tell. But these two are the same, so maybe just normal activity.\n\nFourth event: Calculator.exe (which is the same as calc.exe) again loading urlmon.dll. Wait, the name is slightly different here, but it's probably the same process. However, the file path is the same as the first event. So two instances of calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. But urlmon.dll is a legitimate file. However, sometimes attackers might use DLLs in unexpected ways. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's being loaded from an unusual location, but here it's System32, which is normal.\n\nWait, but looking at the first and fourth events, both are calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. But is there a pattern here? Maybe the user is just running the calculator, which uses urlmon.dll. But why would that be logged? Maybe the system is monitoring image loads, which is normal. However, if there's a high number of such events or other anomalies, but in this case, it's only two events. \n\nThe other two events are svchost.exe making registry changes. Registry changes by svchost could be part of normal operations, but they might also indicate malware. But without more context, like the specific registry keys or values changed, it's hard to say. However, the fact that there are two identical events might suggest a possible issue, but maybe not.\n\nPutting it all together: The first and fourth events are calc.exe loading a legitimate DLL. The other two are svchost.exe making registry changes. Unless there's something else, like multiple registry changes or other suspicious activity, but in this case, the events don't seem to indicate a clear attack. However, the presence of multiple registry events might be a red flag. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user is just running some normal processes. \n\nAlternatively, could there be something else? For example, if the same file was loaded multiple times, but that's normal. Or if the registry changes are to specific keys that are commonly targeted. But the data here is limited. The justification would be that there's no clear malicious activity, but the presence of multiple events might be worth looking into. However, since the classification is either interesting or not, I need to decide. Since the events don't show clear signs of attack, maybe it's not interesting. But maybe the repetition of registry events is suspicious. However, without more info, I think the confidence is low. So the classification is likely NOT INTERESTING, but with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe) and standard system files (urlmon.dll) with no clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
