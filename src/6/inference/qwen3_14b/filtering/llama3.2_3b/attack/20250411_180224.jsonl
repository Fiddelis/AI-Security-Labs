Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: There's a process called cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a scheduled task using schtasks. The task is set to run daily under the system account, and the trigger is a PowerShell command that runs a script from c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. The script name has \"NonExistingScript\" in it, which might be a red flag because it's trying to execute a script that doesn't exist. Also, the use of -ep bypass is a common technique to bypass execution policies in PowerShell, which is often used in attacks. The task name is \"win32times\" which sounds a bit suspicious, maybe a typo or a fake name.\n\nSecond event: Another schtasks.exe process creating a scheduled task with similar parameters. The trigger here is \"c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1\" which again has \"NonExistingScript\" in the name. This repetition of non-existing scripts might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code that's not present, possibly leading to errors or unexpected behavior. The task name is the same as before, which could be part of a larger plan.\n\nThird event: schtasks.exe image loaded. This is a normal system process, so maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nFourth event: svchost.exe with a registry value set. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so this might be normal, but combined with other events could be part of something.\n\nFifth event: svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. That path is where scheduled tasks are stored, so this could be related to the task creation mentioned earlier. The file name matches the task name from the first event, which is a connection here.\n\nSixth event: schtasks.exe query, which is just checking the task, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSeventh event: Again, schtasks.exe image loaded. Normal again.\n\nEighth event: conhost.exe with registry value set. Conhost is related to console windows, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nNinth and tenth events: winlogbeat.exe creating files in the downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating config files might be normal, but the presence of .yml.new files could be part of configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nEleventh and twelfth events: powershell.exe creating files in the downloads folder. Creating text files might be benign, but if those files are part of data exfiltration or something else, it could be suspicious. However, the names like \"estrutura_geral.txt\" and \"entrada_ativo.txt\" don't immediately scream malicious.\n\nThirteenth event: powershell.exe with process accessed. Not sure what that means exactly, but maybe it's just a normal access.\n\nFourteenth event: whoami.exe executed. That's a standard command to get the current user, which could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the scheduled tasks being created with non-existing PowerShell scripts, using bypassed execution policies, and the task names that seem arbitrary. The fact that the same task name is used in multiple events might indicate a failed attempt to execute a script, which could be part of an attack. The other events involving svchost, winlogbeat, and powershell creating files might be normal, but combined with the suspicious task creation, it's worth looking into. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the combination of creating scheduled tasks with non-existent scripts and using bypass techniques is concerning enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell commands referencing non-existent scripts (e.g., 'NonExistingScript.ps1'), using '-ep bypass' to bypass execution policies, and task names like 'win32times' which may indicate adversarial activity. The combination of schtasks.exe process creation, registry modifications, and file creation in system directories suggests potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
