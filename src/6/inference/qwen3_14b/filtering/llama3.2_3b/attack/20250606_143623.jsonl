{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, it looks like **PowerShell** is being used to perform several actions on a Windows system. Let's break down what's happening and what might be suspicious or notable:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **1. PowerShell Script Execution**\n\nThe logs show multiple instances of **PowerShell scripts** being executed. Here is the relevant command line:\n\n```powershell\npowershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n```\n\n#### ‚úÖ **What this does:**\n- **`New-Service`** creates a new Windows service named `objeto_ativo`.\n- **`BinaryPathName`** specifies the path to the executable file:  \n  `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`  \n  This is the service's startup file.\n- **`Start-Service`** starts the service immediately after creation.\n\n#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Concerns:**\n- **Unusual service creation:** Creating a new service using PowerShell might be suspicious, especially if it's not a standard or well-known service.\n- **Uncommon file path:** The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is not a standard Windows system path. This could indicate a custom or possibly malicious service.\n- **No user interaction:** This is often seen in automated or script-based attacks.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **2. Execution Policy**\n\nAnother log shows:\n\n```powershell\npowershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\n```\n\n#### ‚úÖ **What this does:**\n- It runs a simple PowerShell command (`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`) with the **`Restricted`** execution policy.\n- **`Restricted`** is the default execution policy in Windows, which prevents the running of scripts unless they are signed or come from a trusted location.\n\n#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Concerns:**\n- If this was run by an attacker, they might be testing whether the execution policy is bypassed.\n- However, the command itself is harmless.\n\n---\n\n### üìÅ **3. File and Process Information**\n\n- **`file`: `\"None\"`** ‚Äì No file was logged or detected in most of the events.\n- **`process`: `\"None\"`** ‚Äì In some logs, the process field is missing or empty, which could indicate incomplete log data or an issue with the logging system.\n\n---\n\n### üß† **What Could This Be?**\n\n1. **Legitimate Scripting:**\n   - It might be a **legitimate automation script** that creates a service for a custom application (e.g., a monitoring tool or background process).\n   - The name `objeto_ativo` might be part of a Portuguese or Spanish application, depending on the context.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity:**\n   - If the service (`tarefa_logico.exe`) is **not known or trusted**, this could be **malware**.\n   - The use of **PowerShell** to install a new service is a common **attack pattern** in **malware installation** or **persistence mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n\n1. **Analyze the file `tarefa_logico.exe`:**\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal**, **PE Explorer**, or **Malware Analysis Sandboxes** to check if it's malicious.\n\n2. **Check the service details:**\n   - Use the command:  \n     ```powershell\n     Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter \"Name='objeto_ativo'\"\n     ```\n   - This will show the service's properties, including the executable path, startup type, etc.\n\n3. **Check for unexpected network activity:**\n   - Use tools like **Wireshark**, **Netstat**, or **Process Monitor** to see if `tarefa_logico.exe` is connecting to external IP addresses or sending data.\n\n4. **Check for other suspicious processes:**\n   - Use **Windows Event Viewer**, **Sysmon**, or **SIEM tools** to look for other unusual activity.\n\n---\n\n### üõ°Ô∏è **Mitigation Recommendations:**\n\n- **Monitor PowerShell usage** with **audit policies** enabled:\n  - Enable **\"Audit PowerShell\"** policy in **Group Policy** or **Registry**.\n- **Limit PowerShell usage** for untrusted users.\n- **Use whitelisting** for allowed scripts and services.\n- **Enable logging** for PowerShell and monitor for suspicious commands like `New-Service`, `Start-Service`, or `Invoke-Expression`.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ **Summary**\n\n- **Action:** PowerShell is being used to create and start a new service named `objeto_ativo`.\n- **Path:** `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` (possibly custom or malicious).\n- **Risk:** Medium to high, depending on whether the service is legitimate or not.\n- **Next Steps:** Analyze the service executable, check for suspicious network activity, and review logs.\n\n---\n\nIf you're in a **security or incident response** role, I recommend you investigate the file `tarefa_logico.exe` further to determine its legitimacy. Let me know if you'd like help analyzing the file or writing a PowerShell script to monitor for similar activity."}
