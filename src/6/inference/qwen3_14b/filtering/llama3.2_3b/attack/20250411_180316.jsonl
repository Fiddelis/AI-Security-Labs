{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity. The user mentioned that I should consider the entire batch as a whole, so I can't just look at individual events but need to see patterns or combinations.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. That's common in some attacks, but not always malicious. Then there's the 'cmd.exe' with command lines like 'wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete' and 'copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe'. Wait, the 'copy' command is replacing sethc.exe with a backup file. That might be part of an attack where they're replacing a legitimate system file with a malicious one, like a backdoor. \n\nAlso, there's a 'schtasks.exe' being used to delete a scheduled task named 'win32times'. Deleting a scheduled task could be part of covering tracks. And the 'schtasks \/delete \/f' command might be trying to remove evidence of a scheduled task that was used for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother thing is the 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll. These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the paths are correct, so maybe that's normal. \n\nThere's also multiple instances of 'Registry value set' events. While registry changes are common, if there's a pattern of modifying specific keys or values that are related to persistence or configuration changes, that's suspicious. However, the events don't specify which registry keys, so I can't be sure.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' commands are just checking the user context, which is normal. But combined with other commands, it might be part of a larger attack. \n\nThe fact that there are multiple 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' processes with various commands that could be used for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence. The 'copy' command replacing sethc.exe is particularly concerning because sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys utility, and replacing it with a malicious file is a known technique used in attacks, like the one where it's replaced with a backdoor.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch has several events that could indicate malicious activity, especially the replacement of system files and the use of commands to delete scheduled tasks. However, without more context on the registry changes or other indicators, it's a bit tricky. But the presence of these specific commands and file replacements makes me think this is worth investigating further. So I'd classify this as interesting with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including attempts to delete processes (wmic command), replace system files (copy sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe), and interact with scheduled tasks (schtasks \/delete). These actions are commonly associated with malware persistence and evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs in JSONL format and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. Let me check the tasks associated with these processes. There's a lot of 'Image loaded' events pointing to various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. Creating a script in the Temp folder could be part of a malicious activity, especially if it's being executed. Also, looking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check for the existence of certain .bat files. These paths have some odd structures with '..\\' which might be trying to access parent directories, possibly to bypass restrictions or access files that shouldn't be reachable.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with the same command line. That might indicate some kind of looping or repeated execution, which isn't typical. Also, the presence of multiple 'Registry value set' events could suggest changes to the registry, which is often done by malware to persist or alter system behavior.\n\nHowever, there's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that might be normal unless there's something else suspicious about it. But the rest of the events don't seem to link that to any malicious activity directly.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell executing scripts in the Temp directory, checking for .bat files with unusual paths, and multiple registry changes might indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or bypass security measures. However, without more context or additional suspicious events like network activity or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the number of PowerShell events and the Temp file creation, I'd lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts in temporary directories, checking for existence of suspicious .bat files with obfuscated paths, and registry modifications may indicate potential malicious activity or script-based attacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of ImageLoad events, which is normal because PowerShell often loads DLLs. But I notice some file creation and deletion events. For example, a file is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That might be a red flag because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like dropping a malicious script and then cleaning up.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is used to create new items and set content in various paths. The commands use New-Item and Set-Content, which are standard PowerShell commands. However, the paths mentioned are a bit suspicious. They have a pattern with \"modulo_ativo\", \"pacote_temporario\", and other terms that might be part of a naming convention used by attackers to obfuscate their activities. The use of \"..\\\" in the paths could indicate that they're navigating directories in a way that's not straightforward, maybe to avoid detection or to access files in parent directories.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate event for a file named \"elemento_padrao.txt\" in the Downloads folder. While downloading files isn't inherently malicious, the combination with other events might be concerning. However, the main issue here is the repeated creation and deletion of temporary files, which could be an indicator of something like a script being executed and then removed to avoid leaving traces.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. Chrome.exe has some registry events, but those don't seem suspicious on their own. The main focus is on PowerShell activities. The fact that multiple files are created and deleted in different directories, along with the use of PowerShell for file manipulation, could indicate an attempt to execute scripts in a stealthy manner.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Some of these activities could be part of legitimate software operations. But the pattern of creating temporary files, using obfuscated paths, and the high number of related events do raise a red flag. It's possible that this is part of a larger attack, such as deploying malware or executing a script that's supposed to be hidden.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, the use of PowerShell for these operations, and the obfuscated file paths makes this batch of logs interesting for further investigation. It's not definitive proof of an attack, but the indicators are present that warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs presents several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, particularly due to the **repeated use of PowerShell for file manipulation** and **obfuscated file paths**. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious File Creation and Deletion**\n- **Example**:  \n  - A file is created in the **Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\...Temp\\...`) and **immediately deleted** (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`).  \n  - **Implication**: This behavior is commonly seen in **malicious payloads** (e.g., dropping a script, executing it, then cleaning up traces). The transient nature of these files could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Scripting with Obfuscated Paths**\n- **Recurring Patterns in `New-Item` and `Set-Content` Commands**:  \n  - Scripts create files in directories with **non-standard, obfuscated names** (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `pacote_temporario`, `estrutura_padrao`, `objeto_logico`).  \n  - **Path Manipulation**: The use of `..\\\" (parent directory navigation) suggests **intentional obfuscation** to evade simple monitoring tools or to access files in unexpected locations.  \n  - **Example Command**:  \n    ```powershell\n    New-Item \"C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\\" -Force | Out-Null\n    Set-Content -Path \"C:\\registro_logico\\estrutura_logico\\..\\\" -Value \"dir\"\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **3. High Volume of PowerShell Activity**\n- **Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Provider Lifecycle` Events**:  \n  - PowerShell is used repeatedly to **create files and directories** across different paths.  \n  - **Potential Use Case**: This could be part of a **multi-stage attack** (e.g., deploying a payload, creating backdoors, or establishing persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Legitimate vs. Malicious Behavior**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:  \n  - PowerShell is a common tool for **administrative tasks**, and file creation\/deletion is normal in some contexts.  \n- **Red Flags**:  \n  - **Lack of clear purpose**: The scripts do not reference known legitimate tools or processes.  \n  - **Repetitive and fragmented paths**: The use of obfuscation and non-standard naming suggests **malicious intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Analyze the Contents of Created Files**:  \n   - Check if the files (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`) contain malicious code (e.g., PowerShell commands, encoded payloads, or references to external resources).  \n   - Use tools like **YARA rules** or **sandboxing** to detect malware.\n\n2. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:  \n   - Investigate if the scripts are setting up **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **service hooks** to maintain access.\n\n3. **Correlate with Network Activity**:  \n   - Look for **unusual outbound connections** (e.g., to C2 servers) or **data exfiltration** during the same timeframe.\n\n4. **User and Privilege Context**:  \n   - Determine if the actions were performed by a **privileged user** or if there was **compromised credentials** involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **high-risk behavior** consistent with **malicious activity**, particularly due to the **obfuscation, file manipulation, and repetitive PowerShell use**. While not definitive proof of an attack, these indicators **strongly warrant further investigation** to rule out compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the processes, there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell.exe. Many of the command lines show the use of New-Item and Set-Content commands, which are used to create files and write content to them. For example, the first event creates a batch file and sets its content to \"dir\". This kind of behavior is common in scripts, but when done in a way that's evading detection or part of a larger malicious payload, it can be suspicious.\n\nI notice that multiple files are being created in various paths, some of which are in temporary directories or user-specific locations. The use of \"..\\\" in the file paths might be an attempt to traverse directories, which could be a red flag. Also, the repeated use of PowerShell with commands that check if a file exists (Test-Path) and then exit with 0 or 1 might be part of a script that's checking for the presence of certain files, possibly as part of a setup or payload delivery.\n\nHowever, some of these events are related to legitimate activities, like the Windows Defender components (MpClient.dll, MpOAV.dll) being loaded, which is normal. Also, the creation of temporary files in the AppData directory could be part of normal PowerShell operations, especially if they're related to script execution policies or temporary script testing.\n\nBut the key point here is the frequency and the nature of the file creation and modification. The fact that multiple files are being created across different paths, combined with the use of PowerShell in a way that's not obviously benign, might indicate an attempt to execute or deploy scripts. The presence of multiple Test-Path checks could be part of a larger script that's trying to ensure certain conditions are met before proceeding, which is common in malicious scripts.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing suspicious commands, or network activity. The events are all local file operations and process creation. However, the volume and the specific commands used might be enough to warrant further investigation, especially if this is part of a larger pattern that's not typical for the system's normal operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while not all events are necessarily malicious, the combination of frequent PowerShell usage, file creation with potential path traversal, and the absence of obvious benign context could make this batch of events interesting for further analysis. It's not a clear-cut attack, but it's suspicious enough to be flagged for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious behavior** warranting further investigation, though not definitively malicious. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**:\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple entries involve `powershell.exe` executing scripts with `Test-Path` checks (e.g., `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}`). This is often used in **malicious scripts** to verify prerequisites (e.g., presence of payloads, success of prior steps) or to evade detection by checking for analysis tools.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Modification**:\n   - Scripts like `New-Item` and `Set-Content` are used to create and modify files (e.g., `C:\\...\\.bat` files with content like `\"dir\"`). While benign in isolated cases, the **repetition across multiple paths** (including temporary directories like `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) and use of `..\\\" in paths (directory traversal) raise concerns about **script obfuscation or payload deployment**.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Benign Context**:\n   - No obvious legitimate purpose (e.g., user-initiated scripting, software installation) is indicated. The files created (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) resemble **PowerShell script policy testing**, which could be **normal** but is often **exploited** in attacks to bypass execution policies.\n\n4. **Volume of Activity**:\n   - Over **20 events** involving PowerShell, file creation, and path checks in a short timeframe could indicate **automated tooling** (e.g., malware or reconnaissance scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious**:\n- **Legitimate**: \n  - Windows Defender modules (`MpClient.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) being loaded are normal.\n  - Temporary files in `AppData\\Local\\Temp` can be part of legitimate PowerShell operations (e.g., script execution).\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - Repeated `Test-Path` checks and file creation in non-standard locations (e.g., `C:\\objeto_logico\\...`) without clear context.\n  - The use of `..\\\" in paths may indicate **directory traversal** or **obfuscation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile not conclusive proof of compromise, the **combination of PowerShell misuse, file creation in suspicious locations, and lack of clear benign context** makes this batch of events **worth investigating further**. Prioritize:\n- Checking the contents of created files (e.g., `*.bat`, `*.ps1`).\n- Correlating with network activity (e.g., outbound connections, DNS queries).\n- Reviewing system logs for **other anomalous behavior** (e.g., unexpected service startups, user account activity).\n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation**—likely benign but requires deeper analysis to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. That path seems a bit suspicious because the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive is typically used for PowerShell profiles, but maybe creating a file there isn't normal? Not sure yet. Then there's a ProcessAccess event for PowerShell, but no file involved. Then a ProcessCreate for whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info, so that might be benign.\n\nNext, there are several PowerShell processes with command lines that check if certain executable files exist. For example, checking if 'C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\estrutura_secundario\\bin\\entrada_base.exe' exists. These paths look like they might be custom or non-standard, which could be a red flag. The command lines use Test-Path, which is a PowerShell cmdlet. If these files don't exist, the script exits with 1. But why would someone check for these files? Maybe part of a setup or installation process, but the paths are not typical system directories. That could be part of a malicious script trying to check for the presence of certain components before proceeding.\n\nThen there's an ImageLoad event for clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal for PowerShell, so that's probably okay. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that PowerShell is loading various .NET components, which is standard but not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother event is a FileDelete logged for a temporary file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1'. Deleting a temporary script file might be normal, but the name suggests it's related to a script policy test. Maybe part of a legitimate process, but again, the presence of such a file could be part of an attack if it's being used to execute malicious code.\n\nThen there are more PowerShell processes checking for other files in different directories. The paths are all custom and not standard system paths. This repetitive checking might be part of a script trying to locate or verify the presence of specific files, which could be part of a larger operation, like checking for dependencies or trying to determine the environment before executing malicious code.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe process that checks if a file exists in the temp directory. That's similar to the PowerShell checks. The use of both PowerShell and cmd.exe for similar tasks might be part of a multi-stage attack, using different shells to perform checks.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and whoami.exe. The repetition might indicate that these processes are being monitored or accessed multiple times, which could be normal if they're part of a legitimate process, but could also be part of an attack where the attacker is repeatedly accessing the process to inject code or check status.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the key suspicious elements are the non-standard file paths being checked, the repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to check for the existence of these files, and the deletion of a temporary script file. These could be signs of an attacker probing the system, looking for specific files that might be part of a larger payload or trying to determine the environment before executing malicious code.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these activities could be part of legitimate software operations. For example, checking for the presence of certain files might be part of a setup or configuration script. But the combination of multiple such checks across different directories, along with the deletion of a temporary script, increases the likelihood that this is not a normal process.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that the processes are being accessed in a way that's not typical. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But the overall pattern does raise some red flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **multiple suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential **malicious activity** or **unusual system behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive File Existence Checks**:\n   - **PowerShell and `cmd.exe`** repeatedly use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files in **non-standard, custom paths** (e.g., `C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`). These paths are not typical system directories and may indicate:\n     - **Probing for specific files** (e.g., payloads, dependencies, or indicators of compromise).\n     - **Precondition checks** for a larger operation (e.g., deployment, execution, or data exfiltration).\n\n2. **Unusual File Deletion**:\n   - A temporary file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1` is deleted. While temporary files are common, the name suggests **script policy testing**, which could relate to:\n     - **Malicious script execution** (e.g., bypassing policy enforcement).\n     - **Cleanup after a failed or successful attack**.\n\n3. **Abnormal Process Access**:\n   - **Frequent `ProcessAccess` events** for `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` (e.g., 6+ instances). While `whoami.exe` is benign, repeated access to `powershell.exe` could indicate:\n     - **Process injection** or **monitoring** by an attacker.\n     - **Automation scripts** that are not explicitly logged or justified.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Context**:\n   - No clear justification for the repetitive checks or deletions (e.g., no logs of legitimate setup\/installation processes).\n   - The use of **non-English directory names** (e.g., `objeto_logico.txt`, `pacote_principal`) may indicate **obfuscation** or **custom malware**.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Scenarios**\n- **Malware Reconnaissance**:\n  - The checks for non-standard files may be **scanning for vulnerabilities** or **identifying system configurations**.\n  - The temporary file deletion could be **erasing evidence** of a script execution attempt.\n\n- **Living Off the Land (LotL) Behavior**:\n  - Using native tools (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`) to perform suspicious tasks (e.g., file checks, process manipulation) without installing additional malware.\n\n- **Script-Based Attack**:\n  - The repeated `Test-Path` commands could be part of a **conditional payload execution** (e.g., \"if file X exists, run Y\").\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to IPs\/domains) during these events.\n   - Review **file integrity logs** to see if the checked files were created\/modified.\n\n2. **Analyze the Deleted File**:\n   - Recover the deleted `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` file (if possible) to inspect its contents for malicious code.\n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell and CMD Usage**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** to capture full command-line arguments and script content.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Investigate if the suspicious activity is part of a **scheduled task**, **service**, or **registry key** that persists across reboots.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events exhibit **high-risk behavior** consistent with **malware reconnaissance** or **script-based attacks**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a **false positive**, **legitimate activity**, or **active threat**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a normal command to get the current user, so not suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The command lines here are a bit odd. They all seem to be checking if certain files exist using Test-Path, then exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script checking for the presence of specific files. \n\nLooking at the command lines, the paths mentioned like 'C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...' don't look like standard Windows directories. They have a lot of folders with names like 'estrutura_auxiliar' and 'src', which might be part of a custom application or maybe something malicious. The fact that these paths are being checked repeatedly could indicate that the attacker is trying to determine if certain files are present, perhaps as part of a payload delivery or checking for the presence of a backdoor.\n\nThen there are events where 'Image loaded' is logged, such as mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell scripts. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be a red flag if these files are being loaded in an unusual context, but in this case, it's just part of the normal operation of Defender. \n\nFile creation and deletion events are present. The file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest...' is a temporary script file. The fact that it's created and then deleted might be part of a script execution that's trying to avoid leaving traces. However, the name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be a legitimate test by the system, but the repeated creation and deletion could be suspicious.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be normal, but in combination with other events, it could be part of inter-process communication that's not typical. The 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's execution engine, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell processes checking for files in non-standard paths, along with temporary file creation and deletion, might indicate an attempt to execute a script or check for the presence of certain components. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more context on the files being checked, it's a bit hard to confirm. But the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation. The user might be dealing with a potential script-based attack or reconnaissance activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Frequent Execution:** Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are logged, with command lines involving `Test-Path` checks on non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...`). These paths contain terms like `estrutura_auxiliar` and `src`, which may indicate custom or obfuscated scripts, potentially linked to malicious activity.\n   - **Temporary Files:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and deleted in the `Temp` directory. While temporary files are common, the combination of creation and deletion may suggest an attempt to execute a script without leaving persistent traces.\n\n2. **File and Image Loading:**\n   - **Legitimate Components:** Loading of `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and Windows Defender components (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are normal for PowerShell operations.\n   - **Suspicious Paths:** The non-standard directories checked by `Test-Path` could indicate reconnaissance (e.g., probing for the presence of specific files or directories).\n\n3. **System Activity:**\n   - **Pipe Creation:** A `Pipe Created` event is logged, which could be benign (e.g., inter-process communication) but may also be part of a more complex attack chain.\n   - **Lifecycle Events:** `Engine Lifecycle` and `PipeEvent` logs are not inherently malicious but may be used to coordinate processes or evade detection.\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The non-standard directories checked by `Test-Path` (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\...`) may indicate an attacker probing the file system for sensitive data or existing malicious payloads.\n- **Script Execution Patterns:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` followed by `exit` suggests conditional logic that could be part of a larger script (e.g., checking for prerequisites before executing a payload).\n- **Ephemeral Files:** The creation and deletion of the temporary script file may be an attempt to avoid detection, though this behavior can also occur in legitimate scenarios (e.g., script testing).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not confirm a breach, **they warrant further investigation** due to the following:\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The non-standard directories suggest potential reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.\n- **Script Behavior:** The use of `Test-Path` in a repetitive manner may indicate a script checking for conditions before executing malicious actions.\n- **Ephemeral File Activity:** The temporary script file's lifecycle could be part of an attack, though further analysis (e.g., inspecting the script content) is needed to confirm.\n\n**Recommendation:** \n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for additional events (e.g., network connections, user logins) that may contextualize the PowerShell activity.\n- **Inspect Script Content:** If possible, analyze the deleted temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) for malicious code.\n- **Monitor for Persistence:** Look for signs of persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry modifications) that may follow such activity.\n\nThis activity is **moderately suspicious** and should be investigated further to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the logs to spot any anomalies.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell processes running scripts that check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to see if the script exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That seems a bit odd because normally you wouldn't have so many checks for the same script in different directories. It might be a sign of someone trying to locate a keystroke logging script, which is a common tactic in malware to capture user input.\n\nThen there are a few instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a legitimate command to check user privileges. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it could indicate privilege escalation attempts. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here yet.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a temporary file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for legitimate scripts too. The image loads for clr.dll and mscorée.dll are part of .NET framework, so that's normal. The Calculator.exe and calc.exe entries are also standard, maybe just testing or normal user activity.\n\nThe repetition of checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths might be a red flag. It could be a malicious actor trying to find where the keystroke logger is located. However, without seeing the actual content of the script or more suspicious activities like data exfiltration or unauthorized network access, it's a bit hard to confirm. But the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with a confidence around 0.75 because the repeated checks for a specific script in multiple locations are not typical and might indicate an attempt to locate a malicious payload.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, which is suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nSo, the first few entries are about svchost.exe and chrome.exe having network connections. That's normal, right? Those processes often have network activity. Then there's powershell.exe with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Hmm, powershell is a common tool, but multiple registry value sets might be suspicious. But maybe it's just a script running.\n\nWait, there's an entry where powershell.exe loads an image from a specific path: C:\\Windows\\assembly... That's part of the .NET framework, so maybe that's legitimate. But then there are multiple entries of the same command line for powershell.exe, using ls -recurse and get-childitem. That seems like a command to list files recursively. If that's part of a script, maybe it's just a normal operation. But why so many repeats? Maybe the process is being monitored or there's a loop.\n\nThen there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt. That's a text file, but not sure if it's malicious. Another file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That seems normal. But why is there a .yml.new file? Maybe a configuration change, but again, could be legitimate.\n\nLooking at the frequency: powershell.exe is involved in multiple events, including registry changes, process access, and file creation. The repeated command lines might indicate something automated or a script that's running multiple times. However, without more context, like unusual network activity or accessing sensitive files, it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple registry modifications by powershell could be a red flag, but it's also common in some legitimate scenarios.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious activity? The events don't show obvious signs like downloading suspicious files, connecting to known bad IPs, or executing payloads. The files created are just text files and a config file. The network connections are from svchost and chrome, which are normal. The repeated powershell commands might be part of a legitimate script, maybe a backup or data collection process.\n\nBut the classification is about whether it's interesting for investigation. Even if it's not clearly malicious, if there are multiple suspicious activities that don't have clear explanations, it might be worth looking into. However, in this case, the events seem to be within normal operations. The user might be running a script that's modifying the registry and creating files, but without more context, it's hard to say. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 0.6. But since there's no clear malicious intent, maybe it's not interesting. Wait, but the repeated events could indicate something. Alternatively, maybe the user is just monitoring normal activities. Hmm. I think I need to check if there's any pattern that's typically associated with attacks. For example, if powershell is being used to modify registry keys and create files, but without any other indicators, it's not conclusive. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. But I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe the confidence is around 0.5. However, since there's no direct evidence of compromise, it's safer to say not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system activity, including legitimate processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and common PowerShell operations (file listing, registry modifications). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
