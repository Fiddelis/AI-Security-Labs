The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and process create events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe event has a command line that stands out. Let me check that line again. The command_line is \"cmd.exe \/c sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\" & sc qc win32times\". Hmm, creating a service with a path that points to a .ps1 script. That seems suspicious because PowerShell scripts are often used in attacks, and the script name has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red herring, but the act of creating a service with a script is worrying.\n\nThen there's an event where sc.exe is used to query the service, which is part of the same command. Also, there are multiple registry value set events involving services.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's another point to note.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. However, the file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal, but not necessarily suspicious on its own. The other image loaded events for chrome.exe include amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, that could be an issue. However, chrome.exe loading those might be normal depending on the system's setup.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The key suspicious activity is the cmd.exe command that creates a service pointing to a PowerShell script. Even though the script name is \"NonExistingScript,\" the act of creating a service with a PowerShell script is a common tactic in attacks. Additionally, the multiple registry events might indicate attempts to modify system settings for persistence. The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence on the system. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet. The script might not exist, or the service might not be active. But the actions taken are indicative of an attacker trying to set up a backdoor. The confidence level is high because the combination of creating a service with a PowerShell script and registry modifications is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity including a cmd.exe command attempting to create a service with a PowerShell script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), which is a common technique for persistence. Additional registry modification events and process access attempts further indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
