{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. The first event shows a process creating a scheduled task using cmd.exe. The command line includes creating a task named 'win32times' that runs a PowerShell script with bypassed execution policy. That seems suspicious because using 'bypass' can indicate trying to run scripts that might be malicious.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for PowerShell.exe, which isn't unusual on its own. Then, another registry value set event for cmd.exe. The schtasks.exe events are about querying the task, which is normal, but the initial creation of the task with a PowerShell script is a red flag. \n\nThe other events involve chrome.exe and conhost.exe with registry changes, which might be normal user activity. However, the creation of a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell script with bypass is a common technique used by malware to execute payloads. The script path mentioned, 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', doesn't exist, which could be a sign that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not present, possibly leading to an error or a different payload. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry events and process creations might indicate some level of system manipulation. However, the key point here is the scheduled task creation with a PowerShell script using bypass. Since the script path doesn't exist, it could be a failed attempt, but it's still a suspicious activity. \n\nConsidering all events together, the main suspicious activity is the scheduled task creation with a non-existent script. Other events like chrome.exe and conhost.exe might be unrelated. The confidence is medium because while the scheduled task is suspicious, without more evidence like the script content or further malicious activities, it's not definitive. But it's enough to flag for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious scheduled task creation via cmd.exe that executes a PowerShell script with '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policy), which is a common technique in attacks. The script path 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' appears non-existent, suggesting potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
