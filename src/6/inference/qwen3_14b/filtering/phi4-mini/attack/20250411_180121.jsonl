So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe with a registry value set. Still, not immediately suspicious. But wait, there's an event where powershell.exe is downloading a file from a GitHub URL. The command line shows it's using WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file. Hmm, downloading license files isn't necessarily bad, but the repetition here might be a clue. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is downloading files from different GitHub repositories, each time saving to a temporary file. That's a lot of downloads. \n\nAlso, there are events about files being created and then deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 file. That could be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The fact that multiple files are downloaded and then deleted might indicate some kind of transient malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, powershell.exe is loading clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger process. The Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't always bad, but in combination with the other events, it's worth noting.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries involving registry changes are a bit odd. Browsers don't typically modify the registry much, so that might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But the sheer number of powershell.exe activities, especially the repeated downloads from GitHub, seems suspicious. Even though GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that multiple files are being downloaded and then deleted could indicate that the system is being used to fetch and execute scripts, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the command lines for the PowerShell processes show that they're using WebClient to download files. This method is often used in PowerShell-based attacks. The use of temporary directories and the deletion of files afterward might be an attempt to hide the presence of the downloaded scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple PowerShell downloads, file creation and deletion, and registry changes might indicate a potential security incident.

First, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple chrome.exe processes with Registry value set events. That alone might not be suspicious since Chrome can modify the registry for its own purposes. But then there's a powershell.exe event where it's downloading a file from a GitHub URL. The command line shows a PowerShell script using WebClient to download a LICENSE.txt file. Wait, GitHub URLs can be benign, but the fact that it's downloading a file to the Temp directory might be something. However, the file is a LICENSE.txt, which is common in open-source projects. Maybe it's just a normal download.\n\nNext, there's a File created event for a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file. That could be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but sometimes attackers use startup scripts. Not sure yet. Then another Registry value set by PowerShell. Then conhost.exe, which is a normal Windows process, so probably not an issue.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entries are creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But the same file is created multiple times, which might be a red flag if it's being repeatedly written, but maybe it's just part of the setup.\n\nThen there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so normal. The Calculator.exe and urlmon.dll image loads are standard, as urlmon.dll is used for web browsing. The svchost.exe entries are also normal, as they host various system services.\n\nLooking at the command_line for cmd.exe: it's trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\" using SCHTASKS. Deleting a scheduled task could be suspicious if the task was malicious, but the command is using \">nul 2>&1\" to suppress output, which might be an attempt to hide activity. However, without knowing what the \"spawn\" task was doing, it's hard to tell. It could be a legitimate task that the user wants to remove.\n\nThere are multiple Process accessed events for PowerShell, which could indicate someone is trying to manipulate processes, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The whoami.exe command is just checking the user, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious part is the PowerShell downloading from GitHub, but that's a common action. The repeated file creation by winlogbeat might be normal. The deletion of the \"spawn\" task is a bit odd, but not conclusive. There's no direct evidence of malware or unauthorized access. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, file creations, and process accesses might indicate some automated activity or script running. But since none of the events are clearly malicious (like connecting to a known bad IP, executing a payload, etc.), it's on the edge. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with a note that further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **PowerShell Download Activity**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a command to download a file (`LICENSE.txt`) from a GitHub URL (`https:\/\/github.com\/...`). While GitHub is a legitimate source, the act of downloading files via PowerShell can sometimes be associated with malicious scripts, especially if the file's purpose is unclear or if it's followed by further suspicious actions.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process attempted to delete a scheduled task named `\"spawn\"` using `SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F`. Deleting a scheduled task may be benign, but the suppression of output (`>nul 2>&1`) could indicate an attempt to conceal activity. The name `\"spawn\"` is vague and could hint at a task with malicious intent (e.g., launching a payload).\n\n3. **Repeated File Creation and Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple entries involving `powershell.exe` and `svchost.exe` modifying the registry or creating files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) suggest automated or scripted behavior. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate an attempt to persist or configure processes.\n\n### **Benign Activity**\n- **Legitimate Processes**: \n  - `chrome.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` are standard system processes. Their activity (e.g., registry updates, file creation) aligns with normal operations.\n  - `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files in the `Downloads` directory is consistent with its role as a log shipper.\n\n- **Common File Downloads**: \n  - The download of `LICENSE.txt` from GitHub is not inherently suspicious, as open-source projects often include such files.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Reason**: While no direct evidence of malware or unauthorized access is present, the combination of PowerShell download activity, scheduled task deletion, and repeated registry\/file modifications warrants further investigation. These actions could be part of a legitimate script or tool, but they also align with tactics used in some attack chains (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration).  \n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Correlate the GitHub download with the destination file path and its subsequent usage.\n- Investigate the `\"spawn\"` scheduled task (if it existed) to determine its purpose.\n- Monitor for additional anomalous behavior (e.g., network connections to unknown IPs, execution of suspicious binaries)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is schtasks.exe deleting a task named 'spawn' with the \/F flag. That's a bit suspicious because deleting a scheduled task might be part of an attacker trying to remove evidence. But I need to check more events.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file. Not too worrying. Then, cmd.exe and conhost.exe are involved in registry value sets. Registry changes can be normal, but when combined with other events, they might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is deleting a registry key under HKCU\\SOFTWARE... which might be related to removing persistence mechanisms. Also, reg.exe is used to delete another registry value, which could be part of cleaning up after establishing persistence.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell and registry modifications could be signs of an attacker trying to maintain access or execute scripts. The fact that schtasks.exe was used to delete a task named 'spawn' might be an attempt to remove a scheduled task that was used for initial access. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or network activity here. But the combination of process creation, registry changes, and PowerShell usage is a red flag.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation.

Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's a legitimate file. Maybe a normal operation, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's odd. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of normal operations, but if it's done quickly, it could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The filename has \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which sounds like a test, but maybe it's a red herring.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which is an empty command. That might be a sign of something trying to execute a script but failing, or maybe a placeholder. Also, multiple events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks could indicate something related to PowerShell's execution policy or logging.\n\nThere are several registry value set events. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence, but without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to say. However, multiple registry changes by PowerShell might be a red flag.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are normal, just checking the user. The cmd.exe and conhost.exe events don't seem suspicious on their own. However, the repetition of PowerShell events, especially the ProcessAccess and ImageLoad, might indicate something trying to manipulate processes or inject code.\n\nThe fact that the same PowerShell process is accessing other processes and modifying the registry multiple times could be indicative of malicious behavior. Also, the temporary file creation and deletion might be part of a larger attack, like downloading a payload and then cleaning up.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Some of these events could be benign. For example, Windows Defender updating its own files, or PowerShell scripts running as part of legitimate software. However, the combination of multiple suspicious activities—temporary file creation\/deletion, registry changes, and repeated process access—raises the possibility of a security incident.\n\nI should also consider the confidence. Since there are multiple indicators but none are definitive, maybe a medium to high confidence. But not 100% sure.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. Let me check the tasks associated with these processes. There's a 'File created' event with a temporary file path, then a 'File Delete logged' for the same file. That might be normal, like a script creating and deleting a temporary file. But then there's a 'Pipe Created' and 'Registry value set' events. \n\nWait, the same process (powershell.exe) is loading several DLLs. Some of these are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's not necessarily bad, but the fact that it's loading them might be part of a legitimate process. However, there's also loading of clrjit.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal for PowerShell, but I need to check if there's anything unusual.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes: \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore\". That's deleting a zip file from the temp directory. Maybe that's part of a script cleanup. But why is that suspicious? Well, if the file was created and then deleted, but there's no indication of malicious content here. However, the repeated registry events and process accesses might be more concerning.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's a bit odd. But maybe it's a legitimate action, like an extension. However, the high number of events (multiple entries for chrome.exe) could indicate something more. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the batch should be analyzed as a whole. So, combining all these events: multiple powershell.exe activities, including file creation and deletion, registry changes, and loading of DLLs. The presence of both legitimate and potentially suspicious activities. However, the key here is whether there's a pattern that suggests malicious behavior. For example, if a script is being run that creates a file, deletes it, and modifies the registry. But the justification for being interesting would be if there's a combination that suggests evasion or data exfiltration.\n\nAlternatively, if all these events are part of normal operations, like a script that's just doing some temporary file handling. But the fact that there are multiple registry events and process accesses might be a sign of something more. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or more context, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The presence of PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The events don't show obvious malicious indicators like downloading files from the internet, connecting to suspicious IPs, or encrypting files. But the combination of multiple registry changes and file operations might be enough to flag it as potentially interesting for further investigation. So, maybe the answer is that it's interesting because of the unusual activity around PowerShell and Chrome, which could be part of a more complex attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity (High Frequency):**\n   - **Legitimate Use:** PowerShell is a standard tool for system administration, and many events (e.g., loading `.NET` DLLs like `clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`) are typical during script execution.\n   - **Suspicious Patterns:**\n     - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary file (`objeto_principal.zip`) is created and deleted (`Remove-Item` command). While common in scripts, this could be a **cleanup step** for malicious payloads or legitimate tools.\n     - **Registry Modifications:** Repeated `Registry value set` events by `powershell.exe` may indicate **configuration changes** or **evasion techniques** (e.g., altering registry keys to hide activity).\n\n2. **Windows Defender DLLs Loaded:**\n   - **Legitimate:** Loading `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components) is normal during antivirus scans or real-time protection.\n   - **Potential Evasion:** If these DLLs were loaded **unexpectedly** (e.g., during an attack), they could be used to **bypass detection** by mimicking legitimate processes.\n\n3. **Chrome-Related Registry Changes:**\n   - **Unusual Behavior:** Multiple `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` are **atypical** for Chrome (which rarely modifies the registry). This could indicate **malware masquerading as Chrome** or **unauthorized configuration changes**.\n\n4. **Command-Line Indicators:**\n   - The command `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip` suggests **temporary file cleanup**, which is common in scripts but could also be part of **malware execution chains** (e.g., deleting evidence after payload delivery).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** While no direct malicious indicators (e.g., network connections, encryption, persistence mechanisms) are present, the **combination of PowerShell activity, registry modifications, and Chrome-related changes** raises **red flags**.\n- **Context-Dependent:** If these events occur **outside normal operational hours**, **on non-admin systems**, or **without user consent**, they may signal **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for **network traffic**, **file hashes**, or **user activity** around the time of these events to confirm legitimacy.\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Scripts:** Use **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Transcript` or `AuditPolicy`) to capture script content.\n3. **Investigate Chrome Anomalies:** Verify if the registry changes are linked to **legitimate Chrome extensions** or **malware**.\n4. **Check for Persistence:** Look for **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **services** that could indicate **long-term access**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **interesting for investigation** due to the **unusual combination of PowerShell activity, registry changes, and Chrome-related events**. While not definitively malicious, these patterns **require further analysis** to rule out **evasion techniques**, **malware execution**, or **unauthorized system modifications**."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the tasks. There are several ImageLoad events with paths like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are .NET framework files, which are normal for PowerShell to load. But then there's an ImageLoad for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That might be normal too, but I should note that.\n\nLooking at the files created and deleted: there's a temporary file created and then deleted, which is common for scripts.

The FileCreate events for the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and objeto_padrao.txt might be normal user activity, but I need to check if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, just checking user identity. The chrome.exe events involve registry value sets, but without more context, they might be normal browser behavior.\n\nHowever, the repetition of PowerShell events, especially the ImageLoads and file operations, might indicate something. The presence of multiple ImageLoad entries for .NET and Defender DLLs could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it's possible that this is part of a script or tool that's being used. The fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in multiple operations might be a red flag if this is unexpected.\n\nBut wait, the logs don't show any obvious signs of exploitation or malicious code. The files being created and deleted are temporary, and the commands are standard PowerShell commands. The use of PowerShell is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts, so without more indicators like network activity, unusual registry changes, or execution of suspicious scripts, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI should also consider the confidence. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the volume of PowerShell events and the file operations could be suspicious. However, the justification needs to be concise.
