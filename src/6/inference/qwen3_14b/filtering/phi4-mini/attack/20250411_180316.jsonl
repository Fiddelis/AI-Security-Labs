So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, and Calculator.exe are mentioned. These are common system processes, so maybe not a big deal. But then I see a lot of PowerShell.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The logs show \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. \n\nWait, there's a line where Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll from System32. That's normal, but maybe not suspicious. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the path is in the user's Downloads, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete processes named notepad.exe. That's unusual because deleting processes can be part of a malicious activity, like terminating security software. Then, WMIC.exe is involved, and it's loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But why would WMIC be loading these? Maybe trying to bypass detection?\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of Registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with commands that interact with the registry and processes might be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, some of these events are normal system activities. For example, svchost.exe and chrome.exe are common. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities—like using wmic to delete processes, loading Defender DLLs through WMIC, and frequent registry changes—could indicate a potential security incident. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation, but not enough to be certain. So maybe a confidence around 0.7.

Now, some of these are common, like chrome and powershell, but others like schtasks and whoami might be more concerning depending on the context.\n\nNow, the tasks mentioned in the winlog entries. There's \"Registry value set\", \"Process accessed\", \"Process Create\", and \"Image loaded\". The registry changes and process creations could be normal, but when combined with certain commands, they might indicate something malicious.\n\nWait, there's an event where cmd.exe is used with the command \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That seems suspicious. The sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys command, and replacing it with a backup file might be part of a malicious payload, like a backdoor. Attackers often replace system files with malicious ones.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe being used to delete a task named \"win32times\". Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after an attack. Also, the image loaded event for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but if it's being accessed in an unusual way, that could be a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being accessed or creating processes. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, repeated access and registry modifications might indicate script-based attacks. The combination of these events—modifying registry values, creating processes with suspicious commands, and deleting scheduled tasks—suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI should also check for any other anomalies. The whoami.exe executions are normal for checking user context, but if done excessively, it might be part of reconnaissance. However, the key points here are the file replacement and the task deletion. These actions are often seen in malware operations, such as replacing system files to maintain persistence or evade detection.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show signs of potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events include things like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' events show that PowerShell is loading certain DLLs. Looking at the paths, like 'mscoree.dll' and 'clrjit.dll', those are part of the .NET framework, which is normal. But sometimes, attackers might use PowerShell to execute malicious code, so I need to check for any unusual commands or unexpected file operations.\n\nThen there's the 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events. The file created is a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to store temporary files. However, the file is named something like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_...', which might be related to a script policy test. But the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted could be a red flag. It might be part of a legitimate process, but it's also a technique used by malware to execute and then clean up traces.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events for PowerShell. These might be related to the logging or monitoring tools, but if they're excessive, they could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. Without that detail, it's hard to tell if it's malicious or just a normal system change.\n\nThe 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe' processes are also present. Conhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's doing something unusual, that could be a problem. However, the events here just mention 'Registry value set', which isn't inherently suspicious on its own.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is used to display user information, which is a normal command. But if it's being used in a context where it shouldn't be, that could be a sign of something else. However, in the logs, it's just being executed normally.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The PowerShell activity is significant. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file could be part of an attack. However, the names of the files and the lack of other suspicious activities (like network connections, unexpected processes, or unusual registry changes) make it a bit ambiguous. It could be a false positive or a legitimate system process. But the fact that there's a script file created and deleted, along with multiple PowerShell events, might warrant further investigation.\n\nThe confidence level is a bit tricky. There are enough suspicious points to be cautious, but not enough concrete evidence to be certain. So maybe a moderate level, like 0.6. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough indicators that it's worth looking into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory and immediately deleted. This pattern is common in both legitimate script testing and malicious operations (e.g., executing payloads and cleaning traces).\n   - **Image Loading:** PowerShell loads `.NET`-related DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`), which are legitimate but could be exploited for code injection if combined with unexpected commands or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell` are logged. While registry changes are normal, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) makes it unclear if this is benign or part of persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Provider Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Repeated `Provider Lifecycle` events for PowerShell may indicate logging tool activity (e.g., Winlogbeat) or abnormal process behavior. However, without additional context, this is ambiguous.\n\n4. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are standard tools. Their presence alone is not suspicious but could be part of a larger attack chain if combined with other anomalies.\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Script File Lifecycle:** The temporary script file's creation and deletion could indicate:\n  - **Legitimate Testing:** E.g., PowerShell script policy testing.\n  - **Malicious Activity:** E.g., executing a script and deleting it to avoid detection.\n- **Repetitive Events:** Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Pipe Created` events may suggest abnormal process interactions or monitoring tool interference.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **do not conclusively indicate a security threat**, but the combination of **PowerShell script file manipulation** and **repetitive logging events** raises **moderate concern**. This warrants further investigation, such as:\n- Analyzing the script file content (if recovered).\n- Correlating with network activity, user behavior, or other logs.\n- Checking for unexpected registry changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n### **Risk Score:**\n**0.6 (Moderate)** – Suspicious but not definitive. Investigation is recommended."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loaded an image called MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a FileCreated event in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but sometimes malware also creates files there. \n\nNext, there are several Registry value set events for powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be a sign of persistence or configuration changes, which might be suspicious. The ProcessAccess events could indicate someone trying to access or manipulate processes, which isn't normal.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. That might be part of a legitimate script, but combined with other events, it could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the command lines for the PowerShell processes, they all seem to be checking if certain batch files exist. The paths are a bit odd with the '..' directories, which might be trying to access parent directories. However, these scripts are just checking existence and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a legitimate check, but the repetition of similar commands in different paths could be a red flag. \n\nThere are multiple ImageLoaded events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are normal parts of .NET runtime, so that's probably okay. But the fact that PowerShell is loading these might be part of a script that's using .NET, which isn't inherently malicious but could be used for more complex operations.\n\nThe FileCreated event in the Temp directory for a PowerShell script is another point. Temporary files can be normal, but if the script is named in a way that's obfuscated or has unusual extensions, that might be a sign. However, the name here seems to be a standard .ps1 file.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, registry changes, process accesses, and file creations. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination and frequency might indicate an attempt to manipulate the system. The use of PowerShell for checking file existence in various paths could be part of a larger script that's trying to locate or execute other files. The registry changes might be for persistence. However, without more context or evidence of malicious activity (like network connections, unusual commands, or unexpected binaries), it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut given that there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, and considering that PowerShell is often used in attacks, this batch might warrant further investigation. It's not conclusive, but the presence of multiple events that could be part of a malicious script makes it interesting enough for a security team to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Usage:**\n   - **Frequent PowerShell activity** is observed, including:\n     - **File creation** in user-specific directories (`AppData`, `Temp`), which is common for legitimate scripts but could also be used to execute malicious payloads.\n     - **Image loading** of .NET assemblies (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which are normal for .NET applications but could indicate the use of PowerShell for advanced scripting.\n     - **Registry modifications** (`Registry value set`), which may be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\n2. **File and Path Anomalies:**\n   - **Repetitive checks for file existence** via PowerShell commands (e.g., `Test-Path` with paths like `C:\\pacote_ativo\\unidade_principal\\..`). The use of `..` in paths may indicate attempts to traverse directories or access files in non-standard locations.\n   - **File creation** in the `Temp` directory (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) could be part of a script execution or policy test, but the filename's obfuscation (`alp.ps1`) raises mild suspicion.\n\n3. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity:**\n   - **Legitimate components** (e.g., `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender, .NET assemblies) are loaded, which aligns with normal system operations.\n   - **Registry and process access events** (`ProcessAccess`, `Registry value set`) could be benign (e.g., configuration changes) but may also be used to manipulate system behavior or evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags:**\n- **High frequency of PowerShell events** without clear context (e.g., no user interaction or application context).\n- **Unusual file paths** and obfuscated filenames (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n- **Registry modifications** by PowerShell may signal persistence mechanisms (e.g., adding startup entries or modifying policies).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **not definitively malicious**, the combination of **PowerShell-heavy activity**, **unusual file paths**, and **registry changes** suggests **potential for further investigation**. This could be:\n- A **legitimate script** (e.g., a diagnostic or automated task).\n- **Malicious behavior** (e.g., reconnaissance, persistence, or payload execution).\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Correlate these events with **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections, DNS queries) and **user activity logs** to determine context.\n- Check for **unusual PowerShell scripts** in the `Temp` directory or AppData folders.\n- Monitor for **follow-on actions** (e.g., execution of payloads, lateral movement).\n\nThis batch is **interesting enough for a security team to investigate further** due to the ambiguous mix of normal and potentially suspicious indicators."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, so maybe not too suspicious on its own. But then, there's a file created in Downloads called elemento_padrao.txt. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit odd because Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. But maybe it's just normal behavior if it's updating settings or extensions. However, there are several repeated entries here, which might indicate something automated or possibly malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process checking if certain files exist, like objeto_temporario_script.bat and componente_secundario_script.bat. These files are in paths that seem a bit convoluted, with ..\\ which could be a way to navigate directories. The command lines are using Test-Path, which is normal, but the paths might be trying to access files in unexpected locations.\n\nThen, there's a New-Item command creating a file named componente_temporario_script.bat and another one named unidade_base_script.bat. These files are being created in paths that include modulo_secundario and pacote_base, which might be part of some script or tool. But creating files in such directories could be part of a setup or installation, but maybe also part of a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That's normal because PowerShell might interact with security software. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could be a red flag if they're loading unexpected or unknown DLLs, but in this case, the paths are legitimate system files.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of command_line parameters with PowerShell scripts that are creating files and setting their content. The command lines are using -Force and Set-Content with \"dir\" as the value. This might be part of a legitimate script, but the combination of creating multiple files in different directories, along with the registry changes, might indicate some form of configuration or setup that's not typical.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The activities are mostly file creation, deletion, and registry changes, which can be part of normal operations or setup scripts. The repetition of registry events and the use of PowerShell for file operations could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch shows some unusual activity, especially the multiple registry changes and file operations by PowerShell, but not enough to confirm a security threat. It might warrant further investigation, but not necessarily a high priority alert. So, I'd say it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Creation\/Modification**: \n     - PowerShell is creating and modifying files in non-standard paths (e.g., `modulo_secundario`, `pacote_base`) using commands like `New-Item` and `Set-Content`. For example:\n       ```powershell\n       New-Item -Path \"C:\\path\\modulo_secundario\\componente_temporario_script.bat\" -Force\n       Set-Content -Path \"C:\\path\\pacote_base\\unidade_base_script.bat\" -Value \"dir\"\n       ```\n     - These operations could be part of a legitimate script, but the use of `..` (directory traversal) in paths and the lack of clear purpose (e.g., `dir` as content) raises questions.\n\n   - **File Deletion**:\n     - A temporary file (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) is deleted. While common, this could mask malicious activity if tied to other events.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Chrome-Related Changes**:\n     - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `chrome.exe` (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome...`). While Chrome may update registry keys for extensions or settings, the **repetition** and lack of context (no user-initiated actions noted) suggest potential automation or tampering.\n\n3. **Image Load Events**:\n   - PowerShell loads several system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). While these are legitimate, the **volume** of `ImageLoad` events could indicate:\n     - **Code injection** (if non-standard DLLs are loaded).\n     - **Malware evasion** (e.g., using legitimate processes to execute malicious code).\n\n4. **File Paths and Naming**:\n   - Files like `componente_temporario_script.bat` and `unidade_base_script.bat` suggest **script-based operations**. The names and paths lack clear business logic, which could indicate:\n     - **Custom tooling** (e.g., setup scripts).\n     - **Malware staging** (e.g., preparing for payload execution).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: \n  - Registry changes and file creation could be part of **persistence** (e.g., ensuring malicious code runs on reboot).\n- **Command-and-Control (C2)**:\n  - The scripts might be part of a **C2 framework** (e.g., downloading additional payloads).\n- **Evasion**:\n  - Use of PowerShell and system DLLs may be an attempt to **evade detection** by mimicking legitimate processes.\n\n---\n\n### **No Clear Malware Evidence**\n- **No direct malware signatures** (e.g., hashes, network connections, or known malicious IPs) are present.\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - Scripts for **system configuration**, **software deployment**, or **automation** could explain the activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network traffic** (e.g., HTTP\/HTTPS requests to suspicious domains) or **process tree anomalies** (e.g., PowerShell spawning unusual child processes).\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Inspect the created `.bat` files (e.g., `dir` as content) to determine if they contain malicious commands.\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes**:\n   - Track modifications to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome` for unauthorized changes.\n4. **Check for PowerShell Script Signing**:\n   - Verify if scripts are signed by trusted publishers (e.g., `Set-ExecutionPolicy` settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries show **suspicious behavior** consistent with **potential malicious activity** (e.g., script-based operations, registry tampering). However, **no definitive proof of malware** is present. Further investigation is required to determine if this is **legitimate system behavior** or a **security threat**. **Priority: Medium** for triage."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell processes. There are several entries where PowerShell is creating new items and setting content in files. The command lines show paths that have a lot of directory traversals with \"..\\\" which might be a red flag. For example, \"C:\\\\registro_geral\\\\componente_ativo\\\\..\\\\componente_geral\\\\...\" – that seems like they're navigating up directories and then creating files in different locations. That could be an attempt to hide the actual path or to access sensitive areas.\n\nAlso, there are multiple file creation and deletion events. One file is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That's common in some malicious activities where they don't want to leave traces. But then there's another file created in \"C:\\\\componente_geral\\\\estrutura_comum\\\\objeto_comum_script.bat\" which might be a legitimate script, but combined with the other events, it's suspicious.\n\nThe registry events and image loads (like mscoree.dll, clrjit.dll) are normal for PowerShell, but the combination with the file operations might indicate something. However, I need to check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just the creation of files. The command_line arguments use \"dir\" as the content, which is a simple directory listing command. That doesn't seem too harmful on its own, but the pattern of creating multiple such files in various directories could be part of a larger plan, maybe setting up backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nBut wait, are there any signs of actual malicious payloads? The files created are .bat files with \"dir\" commands, which is just a basic command. Maybe the attacker is testing if the system allows such operations, or maybe it's part of a larger attack that's not fully visible here. The fact that there are multiple Process Create and Access events might indicate that PowerShell is being used extensively, which is common in attacks but not always malicious.\n\nHmm, but the presence of multiple file creations in different directories, even if they're simple, could be a sign of something. However, without seeing more complex commands or connections to external servers, it's a bit hard to tell. The user might be looking for a pattern that's typical of attacks, like creating files in non-standard locations, using directory traversal, or unexpected process behaviors.\n\nIn the end, while some of these events are suspicious, they might not be conclusive on their own. The creation of multiple .bat files with simple commands could be benign, but combined with the traversal and the number of events, it's worth investigating further. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant a closer look, but not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns that warrant further investigation, though they are not conclusively malicious on their own. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Directory Traversal in File Paths:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use paths with `..\\` (e.g., `C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo..\\componente_geral\\...`). This could indicate an attempt to obscure the actual target directory or access sensitive areas (e.g., system or user-specific paths).\n\n2. **Frequent File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n   - A script file (`objeto_comum_script.bat`) is created in a non-standard location (`C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\`), which could be a staging area for persistence or further exploitation.\n\n3. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Repeated `Process Create`, `Process Access`, and `Image Load` events involving PowerShell suggest extensive use of the interpreter, which is often exploited in attacks (e.g., for executing payloads or bypassing defenses).\n\n4. **Registry and Module Loads:**\n   - While loading .NET modules (`mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is normal for PowerShell, the combination with file operations raises questions about the intent (e.g., preparing for code injection or execution).\n\n### **Non-Malicious Possibilities:**\n- The `.bat` files contain only `dir` commands, which are benign on their own. However, the **quantity and distribution** of such files across the system could indicate a broader campaign (e.g., probing for vulnerabilities or setting up backdoors).\n- Some events (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) may be related to legitimate PowerShell configurations or user activities.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **interesting enough to warrant investigation** due to the combination of:\n- **Unusual file operations** (directory traversal, script creation\/deletion).\n- **High PowerShell activity**, which is often a vector for attacks.\n- **Lack of clear benign context** for the observed behavior.\n\nFurther analysis (e.g., inspecting the contents of created files, checking for network connections, or correlating with other logs) is necessary to determine if this represents a security threat. **False positives are possible, but the pattern is consistent with attack behavior.** \n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate further using threat intelligence, process memory analysis, and network monitoring to confirm intent."}

There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist using Test-Path. The command lines have paths that look a bit suspicious. For example, paths like \"C:\\objeto_logico\\elemento_logico\\..\\elemento_base\\pacote_temporario_script.bat\" have directory traversals with \"..\\\", which might be trying to access parent directories.

The command lines involve checking if certain files exist, like \"Test-Path\" with various paths. These paths have names like \"registro_temporario\", \"componente_secundario.exe\", and others. They might be checking for the presence of specific executables, which could be part of a script or a setup process. But why would that be suspicious?\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for \"Process Create\" and \"Registry value set\" events. The PowerShell processes are being created and accessing the registry. The registry events might indicate changes to system settings or policies. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe files created are in temporary directories, like AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for legitimate scripts too. But the fact that they're creating and then deleting files (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1) might be part of a script execution. However, that's a normal part of PowerShell's operation when testing policies.\n\nThere's also a \"whoami.exe\" process, which is a standard tool for checking user context. The cmd.exe process is checking if a file exists in the temp directory. These could be part of a benign script, but the repetitive nature of the PowerShell events might be a red flag.\n\nHowever, the key thing here is that all these events seem to be related to checking file existence and registry changes, which could be part of a legitimate process, like a setup or configuration script. There's no direct evidence of exploitation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The presence of Windows Defender's MpClient.dll being loaded might be a normal part of the system's operation.\n\nBut wait, the multiple Test-Path commands with different paths might be trying to locate files that are part of a staged attack. However, without seeing actual malicious payloads or network activity, it's hard to confirm. The classification here is tricky. The events are suspicious but not definitively malicious. The confidence should be moderate, maybe around 0.6. The justification would be that there's a high volume of PowerShell activity checking for specific files and registry changes, which could indicate a script-based attack, but not enough evidence to confirm it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Volume of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are executed with commands like `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files (e.g., `componente_secundario.exe`, `objeto_logico.txt`). This pattern is common in **script-based attacks** (e.g., checking for prerequisites before executing payloads) but can also occur in benign scenarios (e.g., configuration scripts).\n\n2. **File and Registry Manipulation**:\n   - **File creation\/deletion** in temporary directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) and **registry modifications** (e.g., `Registry value set`) are observed. While these actions are common in legitimate workflows, they can also be used to **persist malware** or **bypass security controls**.\n\n3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`**:\n   - The presence of `whoami.exe` (checking user context) and `cmd.exe` (checking file existence) suggests **post-exploitation activities** or **credential checks**, which are often seen in **malicious campaigns**.\n\n4. **No Direct Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No obvious signs of **data exfiltration**, **exploitation**, or **malware execution** (e.g., network connections, suspicious binaries, or unusual process behavior) are present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious** but exhibit **behavior consistent with adversarial activity** (e.g., file reconnaissance, registry tampering). This warrants **closer scrutiny** (e.g., correlating with network logs, checking file hashes, inspecting registry changes) to determine if this is part of a **benign script** or a **potential attack**.\n\n---\n\n### **Classification:**\n- **Interesting for Investigation** ✅  \n- **Confidence Level**: **Moderate (60%)**  \n- **Justification**: The repetitive PowerShell activity and file\/registry manipulation suggest potential adversarial behavior, but lack of direct malicious indicators prevents a definitive classification."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is being accessed, and some process create events. Also, there's a whoami.exe being run, which is normal for checking user context. But the key thing here is the PowerShell commands. \n\nWait, the command lines for PowerShell are all using Test-Path to check if certain files exist. Like, they're checking paths like C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar... and others. But all of them are exiting with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. That seems a bit odd. Why would someone run so many Test-Path commands? Maybe they're probing the file system to see what's there, perhaps looking for specific files or directories that might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, there are some image loaded events, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the Test-Path checks, maybe it's part of a script that's trying to determine the environment. Then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily. But the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest..., which might be related to PowerShell script policy testing, but that's usually a legitimate activity. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of similar commands. The same Test-Path pattern is used multiple times with different paths. That could indicate that the attacker is checking multiple locations, maybe looking for sensitive files or trying to map the file system. Also, the use of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but again, the frequency here is unusual.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any actual malicious activity. The whoami.exe is normal. The PowerShell commands themselves don't seem to be doing anything harmful; they're just checking file existence. But the sheer number of these events could be indicative of reconnaissance. The attacker might be trying to find files that are part of a larger attack plan, like looking for configuration files, credentials, or other data.\n\nAlso, the presence of the Windows Defender DLL being loaded might be a red herring, but it's a legitimate process. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a script that's being run, but without seeing the actual content of the script, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that the script is being created and deleted in the Temp folder might be a way to avoid leaving traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting this all together, while the individual events might not be outright malicious, the pattern of multiple Test-Path commands, combined with file creation and deletion, and the repetition of similar PowerShell commands, could be signs of an attacker probing the system. This would be worth investigating further to see if there's a larger attack in progress, even if the current events don't show direct harm. So, I think this batch is interesting enough for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, though no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell `Test-Path` Commands:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\[path]\\file.cs\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Purpose:** These checks may be probing the file system to identify the presence of specific files (e.g., configuration files, scripts, or sensitive data). The repetitive nature and varying paths suggest **reconnaissance** or **environment mapping**.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted:\n     ```\n     File created: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\n     File deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\n     ```\n   - **Implication:** This could indicate **script execution** followed by cleanup to avoid detection. The filename suggests a potential attempt to bypass PowerShell script policy restrictions (e.g., testing execution policies).\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`), which is normal for PowerShell. However, combined with the above activity, it could support **script execution** or **code injection**.\n\n4. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events:**\n   - Multiple events with tasks like `Pipe Created`, `Provider Lifecycle`, and `Engine Lifecycle` suggest PowerShell is interacting with system components (e.g., WMI, COM objects). This could be part of **exploitation** or **privilege escalation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Unusual Frequency of `Test-Path`:** The repetitive probing of file paths is atypical for legitimate user activity.\n- **Temporary File Behavior:** Creating and deleting files in the Temp directory is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n- **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose:** The `Test-Path` commands do not align with standard administrative tasks, raising concerns about **reconnaissance** or **preparation for lateral movement**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile no direct malicious payload is evident, the **pattern of activity** (reconnaissance via `Test-Path`, temporary file manipulation, and PowerShell lifecycle events) **strongly suggests an investigation is warranted**. Further steps could include:\n- Analyzing the content of the deleted temporary file (if possible).\n- Checking for unauthorized scripts or configuration changes.\n- Monitoring for follow-on actions (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement).\n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** — the activity aligns with **malicious reconnaissance** but lacks conclusive proof of exploitation."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loaded MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate since Windows Defender is a trusted process. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder, which is common for PowerShell scripts. However, not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set and process accessed events. Those could be normal, but combined with other actions might indicate something. Then there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard tool to check user context. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The script name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" is a red flag. Keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information. The fact that PowerShell is checking for this script in multiple locations might suggest an attempt to locate and execute it.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but when combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger malicious activity. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1) could be part of a script execution that's being cleaned up, which is sometimes seen in malicious activities to avoid leaving traces.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these events are part of normal operations. For example, the presence of Windows Defender DLLs is normal. But the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to find where the keystroke logger is located, possibly to execute it or check if it's already present.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell for these operations. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in such a way with these specific scripts could be indicative of malicious intent. The combination of file creation, registry changes, and process access could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe confidence here would be medium to high. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator, but without more context like actual execution of the script or network activity, it's not definitive. However, the pattern of checking for this script in multiple locations is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant investigation, particularly due to the presence of **keystroke logging indicators** and **anomalous PowerShell behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Recurring Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Significance**: The script name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a **strong red flag**. Keystroke loggers are commonly used in malware to capture sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credentials). The repeated checks across different paths suggest an attempt to **locate or execute** this script, possibly to evade detection or confirm its presence.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted:\n     ```log\n     File created: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\n     File deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1\n     ```\n   - **Significance**: This pattern is often seen in **malicious script execution** to avoid leaving traces. The filename `PSScriptPolicyTest` is also a **common obfuscation technique** used by malware to mimic legitimate PowerShell activities.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads**:\n   - PowerShell loads `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and Windows Defender components (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`). While these are legitimate, their **frequency and context** (e.g., paired with keystroke checks) may indicate **code injection** or **exploitation of trusted processes**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryValueSet` events are logged. While not inherently malicious, they could indicate **privilege escalation attempts** or **tampering with system integrity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate**:\n  - Windows Defender DLLs (`MpClient.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are part of standard antivirus operations.\n  - PowerShell is a common tool for administrative tasks, and temporary script creation is not unusual.\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The **recurring `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` checks** and **ephemeral script deletion** are highly atypical and align with **malware behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script**:\n   - Check if the script exists on the system (even if deleted) and analyze its contents.\n   - Monitor for network traffic originating from PowerShell sessions (e.g., exfiltration of keystroke data).\n\n2. **Audit PowerShell Execution**:\n   - Review PowerShell logs for **unauthorized script execution**, use of `Invoke-Expression`, or `Start-Process` with suspicious parameters.\n   - Enable **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Transcripting`, `Event Logging`) for deeper analysis.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for **credential access** (e.g., `Get-Credential`), **remote execution** (e.g., `Invoke-WmiMethod`), or **file transfers** to external servers.\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Cross-reference these events with **Windows Security logs**, **network traffic logs**, and **endpoint detection tools** (e.g., EDR, SIEM) to identify potential **malware persistence** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware reconnaissance or execution**, particularly due to the **keystroke logging indicators** and **ephemeral script activity**. This warrants **immediate investigation** to confirm whether a security incident is occurring. **Confidence level**: **High** (due to the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and anomalous script lifecycle)."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a task \"Pipe Created\". That's a bit unusual, but not necessarily malicious. Then there are a couple of powershell.exe commands checking if a specific script exists. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", look a bit generic. Maybe they're just checking for the presence of a script, but the exit codes might be part of a larger process.\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's normal for a log shipper, but maybe if there's unexpected activity here. However, the same file is mentioned twice, so perhaps it's just a regular operation.\n\nThen, multiple entries of powershell.exe with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\". These could be part of normal operations, but repeated access might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe \"whoami.exe\" executions are standard for checking user context, which is common in scripts. The \"notepad.exe\" and \"calc.exe\" with registry changes might be benign, but again, need more info.\n\nLooking at the network connections from chrome.exe, there are several DNS queries and network connections. That's typical for a browser, but if there's a lot of unusual domains, it might be a red flag. However, the logs don't specify the domains, so I can't tell from this data alone.\n\nThe key thing here is the repeated use of PowerShell and the checking of specific scripts. The paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands might be red herrings, but if those scripts are not found, the exit codes could be part of a larger malicious process. However, without seeing the actual scripts or more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be normal, but if there's other suspicious activity around it, that could be a point. However, the rest of the logs don't show clear signs of compromise.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear evidence of malicious activity. The PowerShell commands could be part of a legitimate script, and the other events are typical system activities. So, maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I'm not entirely sure. The confidence is around 0.5 because there's some suspicious activity but not enough to confirm a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing commands that check for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in non-standard paths, which could indicate an attempt to locate or execute a keystroke logging script.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious going on here.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note what's happening. The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal command to get the current user. That's typically benign. Then there are several events related to 'powershell.exe' with different tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. \n\nLooking at the command lines for PowerShell, there's a recurring command: 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are all PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That could be part of normal operations, but if done excessively or in certain directories, it might be a sign of reconnaissance. \n\nNow, looking at the image loaded events, there are several .dll files from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading these might be normal, but the presence of multiple image loads could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard. Also, the file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory might be a red flag. Creating a temporary script file and deleting it quickly could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. \n\nAnother point is the multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events. These might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but if they're occurring in a high frequency, it might indicate something unusual. \n\nHowever, there's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' event where a file is created. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate monitoring. But if there's a lot of such activity, it could be a sign of data exfiltration. \n\nBut wait, the majority of the events here are related to PowerShell performing standard file operations. The key here is whether these actions are part of a larger pattern. The fact that there's a file created in the Temp directory and then deleted might be a sign of a script being executed temporarily. However, without more context like network activity or other suspicious files, it's hard to say. \n\nOn the other hand, the presence of multiple registry value sets and image loads might be normal for PowerShell scripts. But the repetition of the same commands could be a sign of a script being run multiple times, which might not be normal. \n\nI should also check if there are any known malicious patterns here. The commands listed are common in PowerShell for enumeration, which is a common first step in attacks. However, without additional indicators like network connections to known bad IPs or execution of payloads, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConsidering the user's instruction to determine if it's interesting, I think the combination of repeated PowerShell commands, temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple image loads might be worth investigating further. It's not conclusive proof of an attack, but it's enough to flag as potentially suspicious. So, the answer would be that it's interesting and requires further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Multiple entries show the command `powershell.exe & {ls -recurse; get-childitem -recurse; gci -recurse}`. These are PowerShell commands to recursively list files and directories. While not inherently malicious, **excessive or repeated use** of such commands could indicate **reconnaissance** (e.g., enumerating file systems for sensitive data).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A file is created in the Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and later deleted. This pattern is commonly used to **execute scripts in memory** or **hide malicious activity** (e.g., downloading and executing payloads without leaving permanent traces).\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads**:\n   - PowerShell loads multiple `.dll` files (e.g., from Windows Defender and .NET Framework). While some are legitimate, **unusual combinations or frequencies** of image loads could indicate **tampering** or **malicious use of PowerShell**.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` may suggest **configuration changes** or **attempts to persist** malicious behavior (e.g., modifying registry keys to autorun scripts).\n\n5. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - A `.yml.new` file is created for Winlogbeat, a log-shipper tool. While this could be part of legitimate monitoring, **unauthorized configuration changes** to log-shippers might indicate **data exfiltration** or **tampering with log collection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**:\n- **Benign Possibilities**: Some activity (e.g., `whoami.exe`, standard PowerShell commands) could be part of routine user behavior or legitimate troubleshooting.\n- **Lack of Clear Malicious Indicators**: No direct evidence of malware (e.g., network connections to C2 servers, execution of payloads, or encryption) is present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis batch of events is **interesting and potentially indicative of suspicious behavior**. The combination of **PowerShell enumeration**, **temporary file operations**, and **registry modifications** suggests **possible reconnaissance or initial exploitation steps**. Further investigation (e.g., correlating with network logs, checking for anomalous process behavior, or analyzing file contents) is necessary to confirm whether this is a **legitimate activity** or part of a **malicious attack**. \n\n**Recommendation**: Flag the activity for deeper analysis and monitor for follow-on actions (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I see three events. The first one is about a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. The file is named estrutura_secundario.txt. That's a normal-sounding filename, but I should note that powershell.exe is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, just creating a text file isn't necessarily suspicious.\n\nThe second event is from winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. It created a new configuration file (.yml.new). This might be part of a normal update or configuration change. Winlogbeat is typically used for monitoring, so this could be legitimate. However, sometimes attackers might use similar names for malicious files, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe third and fourth events are about registry value set and process accessed by powershell.exe. These are more sensitive actions. Modifying registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or other malicious activities. Accessing processes might indicate reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate other processes. \n\nNow, considering all events together. The first two are file creations, which might be normal. But the third and fourth events involve registry changes and process access, which are more concerning. Powershell.exe is involved in all events, which is common for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the combination of file creation and registry changes could indicate someone trying to set up persistence or modify system behavior. \n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The files created are in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for users to save files. The winlogbeat event might be part of a legitimate configuration change. However, the registry modification and process access could be red flags. \n\nI need to check if there's a pattern. Three events from powershell.exe, two of which are file creation, one registry change, and one process access. The presence of multiple events from the same process might be normal if the user is running scripts, but combined with registry changes, it's more suspicious. \n\nHowever, without more context like the content of the files, the nature of the registry changes, or the processes accessed, it's hard to be certain. The confidence here is moderate. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the combination of registry modifications and process access by powershell.exe could indicate potential malicious activity. But since there's no direct evidence like known malicious files or unusual network activity, it's not conclusive. So the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events include file creation, registry modification, and process access.
