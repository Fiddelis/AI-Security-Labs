{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've shared, it appears that a PowerShell script is being executed on a Windows system. The script is scanning the system's INF files (typically used for hardware and driver installation) for specific patterns related to different architectures (e.g., `amd64`, `x86`, etc.). Let's break down the activity and assess its potential impact or intent.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ **Summary of Activity:**\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was created with the **Restricted ExecutionPolicy**, which is a common security measure to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n   - The command line shows a script scanning for INF files in the `inf` directory under the Windows directory (`$env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'`).\n\n2. **Script Functionality:**\n   - The script is looking for INF files that contain a specific pattern:\n     ```\n     [defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]\n     ```\n     This is the section in INF files that defines the installation rules for different system architectures.\n   - If such a section is found, the script sets `$Res = 1` and breaks out of the loop.\n   - The final result is printed using `Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res`.\n\n3. **Multiple Log Entries:**\n   - Multiple log entries show the same script being run with the same command line, possibly indicating:\n     - A repeated or failed attempt to execute the script.\n     - A script that is being monitored or logged by an endpoint detection system (like Windows Event Log or a SIEM tool).\n     - A script that is being run multiple times (e.g., as part of a test or validation).\n\n---\n\n### üîç **What This Might Indicate:**\n\n- **Legitimate Activity:**\n  - This could be part of a **system check or integrity verification** script that is looking for INF files related to different system architectures.\n  - It might be used by administrators or tools like **SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)** or **Windows Update** to verify compatibility of drivers or system components.\n\n- **Suspicious Activity (Potential Indicator of Compromise):**\n  - If the script is not part of a known legitimate process, it could be:\n    - A **reconnaissance script** looking for INF files that may be used in future attacks.\n    - Part of a **malware or rootkit** that is scanning for system configuration details.\n    - A **post-exploitation script** used by an attacker to check for system compatibility before deploying payloads.\n\n---\n\n### üõ°Ô∏è **Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Verify the Source:**\n   - Determine where this script is coming from. Is it part of a known tool or application?\n   - Check the **parent process** of `powershell.exe` to see if it's initiated by a legitimate application or a suspicious one.\n\n2. **Review the Script:**\n   - If possible, analyze the script or its source for any **malicious behavior** (e.g., network communication, file modification, registry changes, etc.).\n   - Check the **output of $Res**. If it's `1`, that means the script found a match in the INF files.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies:**\n   - Look for other suspicious activities around the same time (e.g., unexpected network connections, file modifications, or process creations).\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** or **Microsoft Sentinel** to correlate this event with others.\n\n4. **Restrict PowerShell Usage:**\n   - If this is not a legitimate script, consider restricting the use of PowerShell with **execution policies** or **script block logging**.\n   - Use **AppLocker** or **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)** to block unauthorized scripts.\n\n5. **Log and Monitor:**\n   - Ensure that **SIEM tools** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems** are logging PowerShell activity and other process creations for monitoring and alerting.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Example PowerShell Script Analysis:\n\n```powershell\n$Res = 0\n$Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf')\nforeach ($Inf in $Infs) {\n    $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName\n    if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') {\n        $Res = 1\n        break\n    }\n}\nWrite-Host 'Final result:', $Res\n```\n\n- This script is **relatively benign** and could be part of a **driver validation tool** or **system integrity check**.\n- It's not performing any file modifications, network activity, or malicious actions.\n- However, the **repetition of the same script** in logs may indicate **monitoring**, **testing**, or **malicious behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Legitimate scripts** can look like this and are used for system checks.\n- **Suspicious scripts** may mimic this behavior for reconnaissance.\n- **Further investigation** is required based on **context**, **source**, and **correlated events**.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you write a **detection rule** for this behavior in **SIEM** or **EDR** systems."}
