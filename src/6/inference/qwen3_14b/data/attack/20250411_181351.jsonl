{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Then whoami.exe is created, which is a normal command to get user info. But then there's another powershell.exe access. Then svchost.exe modifying the registry. Hmm, svchost is a common host process, but modifying the registry could be suspicious if it's not normal.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry and loading various DLLs, including some .NET Framework files and even a Windows Defender DLL. Wait, the last few entries show the same PowerShell command being run multiple times, which captures the screen and saves it as a PNG in the Temp folder. That seems odd. Why would someone run that command so many times? Maybe they're trying to take screenshots for some reason, like exfiltrating data?\n\nAlso, the command line is the same each time, which might indicate automation or a script. The use of Add-Type with System.Windows.Forms suggests they're using .NET to interact with the GUI, which is a bit unusual unless it's part of a legitimate application. But the repetition and the fact that it's saving screenshots could be part of a larger malicious activity, like capturing sensitive information on the screen.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of various DLLs. Some of them are standard, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. But the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs might be normal if PowerShell is running a script that requires those libraries. However, combined with the repeated screenshot commands, it might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the task names like 'Provider Lifecycle' in some events might be related to Windows Defender or other security software. But the fact that the same command is executed multiple times with different filenames (unidade_logico.png, tarefa_comum.png, etc.) suggests that the attacker is generating multiple screenshots, possibly to gather more data or to test if their activity is noticed.\n\nPutting this together: multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry, loading DLLs, and repeatedly taking screenshots. This could be part of a more complex attack, such as a screen capture tool being used to exfiltrate data. The repetition and the use of PowerShell for such tasks are suspicious. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination of events and the repetitive nature of the commands makes this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because the behavior doesn't seem normal and could indicate a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are executing suspicious commands to capture screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory, which could indicate screen scraping or data exfiltration. The repetitive use of the same command line with varying filenames, combined with registry access and DLL loading, suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several PowerShell commands that seem to be taking screenshots. The command lines use Add-Type with System.Windows.Forms, then capture the screen and save it as a PNG in the temporary directory. That's a common technique for malware to take screenshots, maybe to steal information or for persistence.\n\nLooking at the file events, there's a file created and then deleted in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to avoid leaving traces. Also, the temporary files named with random strings could be part of that.\n\nOther events include registry changes and pipe creations, but those are more common and not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated PowerShell commands for screenshots are a red flag. The fact that the screenshots are saved with different names each time (estrutura_ativo.png, modulo_principal.png, etc.) might indicate that the attacker is trying to capture different parts of the screen or multiple screens, which is unusual.\n\nAlso, there's an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted, which could be a sign of a temporary file used for some malicious activity. The presence of multiple screenshot-saving commands in PowerShell could be part of a larger attack, like data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The logs mention winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is part of a log shipper, but that's probably legitimate. The other processes like chrome.exe and conhost.exe have registry changes, but without more context, they might be normal.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious elements are the multiple PowerShell commands taking screenshots and the temporary file creation\/deletion. These could be part of a malicious activity, so the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the repeated screenshot commands and the temporary file handling, which are often seen in malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are capturing screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory, which is suspicious behavior. The combination of screenshot capture, temporary file creation\/deletion, and repeated PowerShell activity raises concerns about potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing an event. The main thing here is that all events are related to Chrome.exe performing various actions.\n\nFirst, looking at the winlog tasks. There are several entries with \"Registry value set\" which is normal for Chrome, but maybe not suspicious on its own. However, there's also an \"Image loaded\" event pointing to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If Chrome is loading that, is that normal? Well, Chrome might interact with Windows Defender, but maybe not directly loading those DLLs. Also, the path for MpOAV.dll seems to be in the Windows Defender directory. But why would Chrome load those? That might be unusual.\n\nWait, but another thing: the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event. So there are multiple registry changes and image loads. However, all processes are chrome.exe. Now, if a legitimate process like Chrome is making a lot of registry changes, maybe that's normal. But combined with loading specific DLLs, perhaps it's trying to bypass security features. For example, if the malware is trying to disable Windows Defender, it might modify registry values and inject code. However, in this case, the image loaded is amsi.dll, which is a legitimate file. But maybe the fact that Chrome is loading these DLLs is not typical. Alternatively, maybe the registry changes are modifying settings related to security features.\n\nWait, the task for one of the events is \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" with the file path pointing to amsi.dll. But amsi.dll is a system file. If Chrome is loading that, perhaps it's a red flag. But I'm not sure. Another entry is loading MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. So maybe Chrome is interacting with Defender, but why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's being used to disable Defender, but the events here don't show that. The registry events might be related to that.\n\nBut the problem is that all the events are from chrome.exe. If Chrome is performing these actions, maybe it's a legitimate process. However, if there's a lot of registry modifications and loading of specific DLLs, it might indicate some malicious activity. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. But given that there are multiple registry events and image loads, maybe this is worth looking into. The classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of multiple registry changes and loading of security-related DLLs by Chrome could indicate an attempt to tamper with system security settings. However, the confidence might be moderate since it's possible that Chrome is doing this as part of normal operations, but the combination of events might be unusual enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and loading of security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) by chrome.exe suggest potential tampering or evasion attempts, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
