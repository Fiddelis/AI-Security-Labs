{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries about powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, it's running a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a classic sign of reconnaissance, which is often part of an attack.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be a red flag if it's being used in an unexpected way. However, I need to check if that's part of normal operations or something malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script that's created and then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a legitimate test, but combined with the other commands, it's suspicious.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might not be significant on their own, but when paired with the other activities, they could indicate that the PowerShell process is part of a larger operation. \n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities seem to be gathering system information, which is a precursor to more serious attacks. The creation and deletion of a temporary script, along with loading various DLLs, adds to the suspicion. Even though some elements might be normal, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity. \n\nI should classify this as INTERESTING because the logs show signs of system reconnaissance and possible script execution that could be part of an attack. The confidence level is medium because while some parts are normal, the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a command chain (`net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, etc.) to **enumerate system users, groups, and stored credentials**. This is a classic **reconnaissance technique** often used by attackers to gather intelligence before escalating privileges or exfiltrating data.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`) was **created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted**. This behavior is commonly associated with **malicious scripts** designed to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loadings:**\n   - Multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender) were loaded by `powershell.exe`. While some may be legitimate, the combination with the above activities raises **red flags** about potential **exploitation or tampering**.\n\n4. **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events:**\n   - Multiple entries with the task `\"Provider Lifecycle\"` for the same PowerShell command line suggest **persistent or automated execution**, which could indicate **malware persistence mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations:**\n- **Chrome.exe Activity:** Normal for a browser; no immediate concern.\n- **Windows Defender DLL (`MpOAV.dll`):** Could be legitimate, but its presence here requires validation (e.g., checking process integrity, parent processes, or file hashes).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**Classify as INTERESTING (Medium Confidence).**  \nThe logs show **system reconnaissance and script execution patterns** consistent with **preparation for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration**. Further investigation (e.g., checking process parentage, file integrity, network traffic) is recommended to confirm whether this is malicious activity or a false positive (e.g., a legitimate script misclassified by the logging system)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a Pipe Created event. That's not immediately suspicious, but I'll note it. The second entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's normal, but the file path is in the Downloads folder. Maybe that's okay, but sometimes malware uses similar names.\n\nThird entry: powershell.exe with a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. That looks like someone is trying to gather information about users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance. That's suspicious.\n\nNext, powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal, but maybe if it's unexpected? Not sure yet. Then net.exe running \"net user\" â€“ that's a standard command to list users, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe.\n\nThen there's a process named net1.exe, which is similar to net.exe but with a typo. That might be a red flag. Maybe a typo in the process name could indicate a malicious process trying to mimic a legitimate one.\n\nAnother entry: powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt. The name doesn't ring a bell, but maybe it's just a normal file. However, if it's in a user's Downloads folder, maybe not too bad.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome does a lot of registry changes, but so many entries here might be excessive. However, the same event repeated multiple times could be a sign of something automated or malicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer, but again, maybe normal. Then SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. Not sure about that one, but SDXHelper might be part of some software.\n\nThe updater.exe process is creating a pipe, which is normal for communication, but the command line is long and includes a URL to clients2.google.com. That's a legitimate Google URL, but the parameters might be suspicious. However, it's part of Google's updater, so maybe okay.\n\nThen there's cmdkey.exe \/list, which is used to list stored credentials. That's a bit sensitive, but if it's part of a script, maybe.\n\nLooking at the repeated Security Group Management and User Account Management events. Those might be part of normal system management, but if they're not expected, they could be signs of privilege escalation or account manipulation.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the powershell.exe commands gathering user and group info, the net1.exe typo, multiple chrome.exe registry changes, and the use of cmdkey.exe. These could indicate someone trying to gather information or manipulate system settings. However, some of these might be normal depending on the environment. The presence of both legitimate and potentially suspicious activities makes me think that further investigation is needed. So, the batch is interesting enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance**:\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing commands like:\n     - `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, `ls C:\\Users`, `get-childitem C:\\Users`, `dir C:\\Users`, `get-localgroup`, `net localgroup`.\n   - **Indication**: These commands suggest **system reconnaissance**, possibly to enumerate users, groups, or credentials. This is commonly seen in **initial access** or **privilege escalation** phases of attacks.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Name**:\n   - A process named `net1.exe` (likely a typo for `net.exe`) is executed with the command `cmdkey.exe \/list`.\n   - **Indication**: The typo in the process name could indicate a **malicious process mimicking a legitimate one** (e.g., a dropper or backdoor).\n\n3. **Excessive Chrome Registry Modifications**:\n   - **12 repeated entries** of `chrome.exe` modifying registry keys.\n   - **Indication**: While Chrome may legitimately modify the registry, such a high volume of changes could signal **malware persistence** or **tampering** (e.g., injecting malicious code into Chrome processes).\n\n4. **Credential Enumeration**:\n   - `cmdkey.exe \/list` is used to list stored credentials (e.g., Windows credentials, network passwords).\n   - **Indication**: This could be part of **credential harvesting** or **pass-the-hash** attacks.\n\n5. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - `powershell.exe` creates a file named `pacote_ativo.txt` in the user's Downloads directory.\n   - **Indication**: The file name is non-descriptive and may be a **drop zone for malicious payloads** (though not definitive without further analysis).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the Downloads directory is likely **normal** if Winlogbeat is configured to write logs there.\n- **Google Updater Process**: The `updater.exe` process with a URL to `clients2.google.com` appears **legitimate** (part of Google's crash reporting system).\n- **Windows Defender Dll Load**: `MpClient.dll` is a legitimate component of Windows Defender.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Analyze the PowerShell commands (`net user`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, etc.) for **unauthorized access** or **data exfiltration**.\n   - Check for **unusual network traffic** (e.g., exfiltration of user lists).\n\n2. **Verify `net1.exe`**:\n   - Confirm if `net1.exe` is a legitimate process or a **malicious file** (e.g., check file hashes, digital signatures, and process tree).\n\n3. **Monitor Chrome Activity**:\n   - Investigate the **registry modifications** for signs of tampering (e.g., injected DLLs, modified startup entries).\n\n4. **Audit Credential Management**:\n   - Review `cmdkey.exe` usage and stored credentials to detect **unauthorized access** or **credential theft**.\n\n5. **Check File Contents**:\n   - Analyze `pacote_ativo.txt` to determine if it contains **malicious payloads** or **sensitive data**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries contain **multiple red flags** (reconnaissance, credential enumeration, unusual process names, and excessive registry changes) that suggest **potential compromise** or **malicious activity**. While some activity is legitimate, the combination of suspicious behaviors warrants **immediate investigation** to rule out threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to \"Security Group Management\" under the winlog task. But those entries have \"process\" and \"file\" as \"None\", which might just be normal system events or maybe placeholders. However, there are some other events that stand out.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe loading images like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those DLLs are part of Windows, but sometimes malicious software can use legitimate processes to load their own DLLs. But I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. Also, there's a process named net.exe and net1.exe running \"localgroup\" commands. Wait, net1.exe isn't a standard Windows process. That could be a red flag because it might be a typo or a malicious executable impersonating net.exe.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of PowerShell.exe creating files, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and modulo_base.txt. Creating files in user directories might be normal, but if it's part of a larger attack, like setting up persistence or exfiltrating data, that's concerning. Also, there's a Registry value set event from PowerShell and svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files could be normal if it's part of setup, but if it's unexpected, maybe it's being used for something else. Also, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is running with a command line that includes \"\/installsource scheduler\". That might be legitimate if it's part of an update, but sometimes malware uses similar names.\n\nLooking at the repetition of events: multiple \"Security Group Management\" tasks might be normal, but the combination with other suspicious activities could indicate something. The fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading multiple DLLs, and there's a non-standard net1.exe, along with PowerShell creating files and modifying the registry, might point to an attack. However, without more context like IP addresses, user accounts, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. But the presence of multiple suspicious processes and file operations could be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: non-standard processes (net1.exe, SDXHelper.exe loading DLLs), PowerShell creating files in user directories, registry modifications, and potential log shipping tool (winlogbeat) interacting with system. These could indicate malicious behavior or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
