{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each entry to see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed, and whoami.exe being created. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's modifying the registry, specifically adding an entry to the Run key in HKCU. That's a red flag because adding to the Run key can be used to persist malware after a reboot. The command line shows they're adding \"estrutura_principal.exe\" to the Run key. \n\nThen there's another reg.exe process adding another entry called \"entrada_principal\" pointing to \"pacote_temporario.exe\". That's another suspicious registry modification. The use of reg.exe and cmd.exe to add these entries is typical of malicious activity trying to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created by powershell.exe named modulo_padrao.txt in the user's Downloads folder. Not sure if that's malicious yet, but combined with the registry changes, it might be part of a larger attack. Also, there are two file creation events related to winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. However, the file paths seem to be part of an installation or configuration process, so maybe legitimate. But the fact that winlogbeat is involved could be a false positive if the logs are being tampered with.\n\nHowever, the key points here are the repeated use of powershell and cmd to modify the registry in the Run keys. That's a common technique for persistence. The presence of multiple registry modifications by different processes (cmd, reg.exe) and the creation of files in the Downloads directory might indicate that an attacker is trying to establish a foothold and ensure their malicious software runs every time the user logs in.\n\nI should check if there are any other suspicious activities. The events don't show any network connections or unusual file downloads, but the registry changes alone are enough to raise suspicion. The classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of registry modifications in the Run keys and the use of command-line tools to do so is indicative of potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence. The confidence is medium-high, maybe around 0.8, since while there's no direct evidence of malicious files, the actions taken are consistent with attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for registry modifications in HKCU\\\\Run keys (common persistence technique), and creation of files in user Downloads directory.
