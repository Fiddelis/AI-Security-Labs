That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome doing that repeatedly might be normal, but maybe not. However, the key thing here is that there are several instances of powershell.exe running with command lines that include Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds like it could be used for keylogging, which is malicious. \n\nLooking at the command lines, they all point to different paths but have the same structure: running Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saving the log to the TEMP directory. That's a red flag. Also, the image loaded events mention .NET DLLs, which could be part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nEven though there are some normal activities like chrome.exe modifying the registry, the repeated use of PowerShell with that specific script and the logging to TEMP suggests an attempt to capture keystrokes. That's a clear sign of malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, and it's saving the keystrokes to a temporary file. That seems a bit odd because keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information. The script path is in a directory named \"modulo_padrao\" which might be a red herring, but the fact that it's using PowerShell to log keystrokes is concerning.\n\nThen there are several other events where PowerShell is involved. Some of them are loading DLLs from Windows Defender, which is normal, but others involve creating and deleting temporary files. The repeated creation and deletion of files like __PSScriptPolicyTest*.ps1 might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but combined with the keystroke logging, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nAnother event mentions a file path that includes \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" again, this time under \"elemento_base\" and \"tarefa_base\". The repetition of the same script name in different directories could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute the same malicious script from various locations, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nThere's also an event where the process is \"None\" and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", with a file path pointing to another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This might indicate that the script is being executed remotely, which is a potential sign of a breach or remote access.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign activities. For example, the winlogbeat.exe events are about creating configuration files, which is normal for a log shipper. The svchost.exe events are related to system services, which are typical. But the key here is the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of multiple instances of a keystroke logging script being executed via PowerShell, along with the creation of temporary files and possible remote execution, suggests that this batch of logs is interesting and warrants further investigation. The confidence level is high because keystroke logging is a clear sign of potential malicious activity, even though some events could be benign. But the combination here is more likely to be a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath parameter to write keystrokes to temporary files ($env:TEMP\\\\key.log), indicating potential keystroke logging malware.
