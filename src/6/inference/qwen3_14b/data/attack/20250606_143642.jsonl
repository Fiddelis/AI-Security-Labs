{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The JSON logs you've provided appear to be **Windows Event logs** captured by a **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) system or **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool, likely from **Windows Event Logs**, **Sysmon**, or **Windows Defender ATP**, and possibly **Microsoft Sentinel** or **ELK Stack**.\n\nThese logs indicate **process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and image loading** events on a Windows system. They are typically used for **endpoint monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response**.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Summary of Events**\n\n#### ‚úÖ **Process Creation Events**:\n- `services.exe`: A system process, likely part of Windows Services.\n- `sppsvc.exe`: System Protection Service.\n- `whoami.exe`: Used to retrieve the current user identity.\n- `powershell.exe`: Multiple process creation events, suggesting script execution or administrative tasks.\n\n#### üóÇÔ∏è **File Operations**:\n- **File Created**:  \n  `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`  \n  This is a temporary PowerShell script likely used for testing or execution.\n- **File Deleted**:  \n  The same script was deleted shortly after creation.\n\n#### üîå **Image Load Events**:\n- PowerShell loads several DLLs from:\n  - `mscoree.dll`\n  - `mscoreei.dll`\n  - `clr.dll`\n  - `.ni.dll` (Native Image DLLs)\n  - `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus)\n\nThese are typical for **PowerShell execution** and are part of the .NET runtime and Windows Defender.\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Notable Observations**\n\n1. **PowerShell Usage**:\n   - A script was created and deleted: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`\n   - This could be part of **script execution testing**, **policy validation**, or **malicious activity**.\n   - PowerShell is a common tool for both **legitimate administrative tasks** and **malicious scripting**.\n\n2. **Windows Defender**:\n   - `MpOAV.dll` is part of **Windows Defender Antivirus**. Its loading is normal but may be of interest if the activity is unexpected or part of a **malware bypass**.\n\n3. **Registry Events**:\n   - `Registry value set` events are common during **service installation**, **software configuration**, or **malware persistence**.\n   - No specific registry key is shown, so further analysis is needed.\n\n4. **Process Access**:\n   - `Process accessed` events may indicate **inter-process communication**, **debugging**, or **malware injection**.\n\n---\n\n### üõ°Ô∏è **Potential Security Concerns (If Context is Unknown)**\n\n- The **creation and deletion of a script file** in the Temp folder is **common in PowerShell execution**.\n- However, if this is **not expected** or **not documented**, it could be a **sign of malicious activity**.\n- The **use of PowerShell** for script execution is **common** but may be **suspicious in high-security environments** unless **explicitly allowed**.\n\n---\n\n### üß™ **Next Steps for Analysis**\n\n1. **Correlate with Other Events**:\n   - Look for **other PowerShell events**, **network traffic**, or **file access** from the same user or machine.\n   - Are there **failed logins**, **unusual user behavior**, or **unexpected network connections**?\n\n2. **Check Script Content**:\n   - If the file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` exists, analyze its content.\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell ISE**, **Notepad++**, or **PowerShell script analyzers**.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Indicators**:\n   - Use **YARA rules**, **SIEM correlation**, or **EDR tools** to check if the script is known malicious or has suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **User Activity**:\n   - Was the user `fiddelis` expected to be logged in?\n   - Are there **other activities** from this user that are unusual?\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**\n\n- These logs represent **normal Windows system activity** with **PowerShell usage**.\n- However, if this is **not expected** or **not documented**, it may be **worth further investigation**.\n- The **creation and deletion of a script file** is a **common technique** in **PowerShell execution**, but it could also be used in **malicious scripts**.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you **write a query for SIEM tools** (like **Elasticsearch**, **Splunk**, or **Microsoft Sentinel**) to **detect similar behavior** or **create a YARA rule** for the script if needed.
