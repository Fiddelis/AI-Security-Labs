{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so I need to check the commands.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a PowerShell command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That's a common technique for data exfiltration or searching for sensitive info. The same command appears multiple times, which might indicate repeated attempts or a script running.\n\nThen there are several Image Loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, but loading them might be normal. However, the presence of multiple Image Load events could be part of a larger process, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nA file is created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts, but if it's part of a malicious activity, like dropping a payload, it could be suspicious. But since it's a .ps1 file and then deleted, maybe it's just a temporary script. However, the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be a red flag.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events, which could be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but in combination with other events, it might indicate something.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line might be part of a script that's running multiple times, which could be a sign of persistence or data collection.\n\nAlso, the presence of Winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file might be related to configuration changes, but unless there's something wrong with the configuration, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nHowever, the main suspicious part is the PowerShell command searching for passwords in files. That's a classic indicator of someone trying to find credentials. Combined with the multiple process creations and the file operations, it seems like this could be part of a malicious activity. The user might be trying to gather sensitive information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell instances running a command to search for passwords, which is a clear sign of potential data exfiltration. Even though some events are normal, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, particularly related to **potential data exfiltration** and **malicious use of PowerShell**. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Command Searching for Sensitive Data**\n- **Event**: Multiple entries show the same PowerShell command:\n  ```powershell\n  findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password\n  ```\n- **Indicator**: This command searches for files containing \"password\" in common file types (e.g., `.xml`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.xls`). This is a **classic technique used by attackers to locate sensitive information** (e.g., credentials, secrets) on a system.\n- **Frequency**: The same command appears **repeatedly** (16 times), suggesting either a **malicious script** or **persistent scanning** for sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **2. File Creation and Deletion in Temp Directory**\n- **Event**: A file `winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` is created by `winlogbeat.exe`, and a temporary `.ps1` file is created and **immediately deleted** in the `Temp` directory.\n- **Indicator**: \n  - The creation and deletion of a `.ps1` file in the Temp directory could indicate **script execution** or **payload dropping**.\n  - The use of `winlogbeat` (a log shipper) to modify configuration files (`.yml.new`) might suggest **tampering with monitoring tools** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual PowerShell Activity**\n- **Event**: Multiple `Process accessed` and `Provider Lifecycle` events for `powershell.exe`.\n- **Indicator**: \n  - PowerShell is often used by attackers for **payload execution**, **lateral movement**, or **data exfiltration**.\n  - The repetition of the same command line (searching for passwords) suggests **automated scanning** or **script-based exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Load Events for .NET DLLs**\n- **Event**: Multiple `Image loaded` events for system DLLs like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `urlmon.dll`.\n- **Indicator**: \n  - These are legitimate system files, but their repeated loading could be part of **malicious process injection** or **DLL hijacking**.\n  - Combined with PowerShell activity, this may indicate **malware execution** or **exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Notepad.exe and Registry Modifications**\n- **Event**: `notepad.exe` is involved in a `Registry value set` event.\n- **Indicator**: \n  - While not inherently malicious, this could be part of **registry persistence** techniques (e.g., creating startup entries).\n  - If `notepad.exe` is being used as a **dropper** or **proxy** for malicious code, this warrants investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries suggest **potential data exfiltration** (via PowerShell scanning for passwords) and **unusual system behavior** (file creation\/deletion, repeated process activity). These are **high-priority indicators** of a potential **attack chain**, such as:\n- **Credential harvesting** (searching for passwords).\n- **Malware execution** (via PowerShell or other tools).\n- **Persistence** (registry modifications, file tampering).\n\n**Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate the PowerShell command** for evidence of data exfiltration or credential theft.\n2. **Analyze the deleted `.ps1` file** in the Temp directory (if possible) for malicious content.\n3. **Check for unauthorized changes** to `winlogbeat` configurations or other monitoring tools.\n4. **Correlate events** with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if data is being exfiltrated.\n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be treated as a potential security incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is about powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal, but I should check if the path is legitimate. The second entry shows a powershell command using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That looks suspicious because it's trying to find sensitive information. \n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe and other processes making registry changes. Registry modifications can be a red flag if they're unauthorized. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal, but I need to confirm if that's typical behavior.\n\nAnother event is findstr.exe being executed with the same command as before, which reinforces the idea of searching for passwords. There's also a File created event in the PowerShell StartupProfileData, which might indicate someone trying to persist access. \n\nMultiple registry value sets by chrome.exe and other processes could be part of normal operations, but combined with the password search, it's concerning. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be part of a legitimate log collection, but if it's unexpected, that could be an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated attempts to search for passwords and the unusual file creation and registry changes suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nThe first event is about chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But why is chrome.exe loading it? Maybe it's a false positive, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're modifying key settings. But again, some applications do that normally. However, the repetition might indicate something automated.\n\nNetwork connections from chrome.exe are common, but there are four entries here. Maybe it's just normal browsing, but if there's a pattern, like connecting to malicious IPs, that would be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention the destination, so I can't tell yet.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Downloads folder. Creating a file isn't inherently bad, but if it's a malicious file, that's an issue. The filenames here are \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\" which don't seem suspicious, but maybe they're just decoys.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be part of a log configuration, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The whoami.exe is a standard tool for checking user context, so that's probably normal.\n\nThe cmd.exe command is deleting scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up, but if these tasks were malicious, that's a good thing. However, the command is run with \/f to force deletion, which might be a sign of someone trying to remove traces.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe deleting another task, \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Again, deleting tasks could be benign, but combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger action.\n\nThe svchost.exe modifying the registry could be normal, but svchost is a common host for system services, so unexpected changes here might be a concern.\n\nPutting this all together, the main points are the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe and powershell, the deletion of scheduled tasks, and the creation of files. However, without more context like IP addresses, file contents, or user context, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. But the combination of these events could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or clean up after an attack. The presence of multiple registry modifications and task deletions might be suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence since some activities are normal but others are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The log contains multiple suspicious activities: 1) Chrome.exe loading a Windows Defender DLL (potentially legitimate but context-dependent). 2) Repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe and PowerShell (could indicate configuration changes or persistence attempts). 3) Deletion of scheduled tasks via CMD and Schtasks.exe (may indicate cleanup of malicious tasks or system manipulation). 4) PowerShell creating files in Downloads directory (requires further analysis of file contents).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is schtasks.exe deleting a scheduled task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task could be part of a cleanup after an attack. Then there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there's a command using wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's odd because notepad is a standard application, and deleting its processes might be part of hiding malicious activities. Also, the use of WMIC with the urlmon.dll and amsi.dll files could be a red flag. Those DLLs are related to Internet Explorer and anti-malware, so loading them might be part of bypassing security features.\n\nThere are multiple registry value sets and process accesses, which might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to maintain persistence. The deletion of user accounts via net user commands is another concerning point. It could be an attempt to remove administrative accounts that were used for initial access.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, using WMIC and PowerShell for process manipulation, modifying the registry, and deleting user accounts suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe', which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. Let me check the commands. One of the cmd.exe entries has a command line that deletes a user with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That's a red flag because deleting domain users can be part of an attack, like removing accounts to cover tracks or taking over credentials.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command is \"sc delete win32times\", which deletes a service. Deleting services might be an attempt to remove malicious services or clean up after an attack. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but combined with other events, it's suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's also 'net1.exe' which is not a standard Windows executable. The presence of 'net1.exe' executing a user deletion command is concerning. It might be a typo or a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate one. That's a strong indicator of something wrong.\n\nThen there are several 'Registry value set' events. While registry changes can be normal, the combination with process creation and deletion commands might indicate configuration changes to persist access or disable security features.\n\nThe 'User Account Management' and 'Security Group Management' events could be part of privilege escalation or modifying permissions. If an attacker is adding or removing users and groups, that's a significant security event.\n\nHowever, I also see entries with 'whoami.exe', which is a normal command to check user context. But when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe repetition of 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events could indicate ongoing activity. The presence of multiple deletions (user, service) and registry changes suggests an attacker trying to modify the system's state.\n\nBut I should also consider false positives. Maybe these are part of a script or legitimate maintenance. However, the use of 'net1.exe' (which isn't standard) and the deletion commands without clear justification lean towards malicious intent.\n\nOverall, the combination of user deletion, service removal, non-standard executables, and registry changes points to a potential security incident. The confidence is high but not absolute because there's a need to check if these actions are part of a legitimate process.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting temporary files. The command line shows it's trying to delete some files in the Temp directory. That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use temp files to store malicious stuff. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and process creates. The whoami.exe command is run, which is just getting user info, so that's normal. But then there are a bunch of events where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is part of .NET, so that's expected. However, the MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red flag if it's being loaded in an unusual way. But the log just says it's loaded, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a pattern I've seen in malware—create a file, use it, then delete it to avoid leaving traces. The file name is a PowerShell script policy test, which might be a legitimate activity, but combined with the deletions and the multiple registry changes, it's suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events. If an attacker is modifying registry keys to persist or hide their activities, that's a concern. The combination of these events—file creation and deletion, registry changes, and multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities—could indicate someone trying to execute scripts or modify system settings without leaving evidence.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be part of normal operations, like script execution or system updates. But the frequency and the specific actions (like deleting files immediately after creating them) might point to malicious behavior.

Events like 'Pipe Created', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'Registry value set'. The file paths mentioned include some system directories, like the Windows Defender one. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. That might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. That's a common command to check user context, but if it's being run repeatedly, maybe part of a script or something trying to escalate privileges. Also, the 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being manipulated or monitored, which is unusual.\n\nLooking at the other processes: 'conhost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe', 'svchost.exe' – these are typical system processes, but the 'Registry value set' events could be part of legitimate operations or could be signs of changes to system settings. However, the repetition of certain events, like multiple 'whoami.exe' process creations and 'Process accessed' on powershell, might indicate some automated script or malicious activity.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' in both 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' might be normal, but if those processes are being used to load DLLs that aren't standard, that could be a red flag. However, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component, so that's probably okay.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: frequent access to powershell, creation of files in user directories, repeated execution of whoami, and registry changes. This could be part of a legitimate script, but the high frequency and the involvement of powershell (often used in attacks) make me think it's worth investigating. The presence of 'Process accessed' might indicate that someone is trying to interact with the process, which could be a sign of a security tool or a malicious actor.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading files from the internet, connecting to external IPs, or modifying critical system files. The events are mostly about process creation and file access, which can be normal. But the repetition and the specific processes involved might be enough to flag this as interesting for further analysis.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.6.

Then there's whoami.exe, which is usually used to check user context, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe changing registry values. Those are typical Windows processes, so maybe part of normal operations. Chrome.exe has several DNS queries and network connections. Multiple DNS queries could indicate normal browsing, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains, that might be a red flag.
