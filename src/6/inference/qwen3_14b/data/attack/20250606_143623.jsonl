{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's an analysis of the suspicious activity:\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Summary**\n\n#### **1. PowerShell Command Execution**\n- **Command Line:**\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" \n  Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n  ```\n- **Description:**\n  - A new Windows service named **\"objeto_ativo\"** is being created with the binary path pointing to:  \n    `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`\n  - The service is then **immediately started**.\n- **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n  - **Unusual Service Name**: \"objeto_ativo\" (which may be a placeholder or obfuscated name).\n  - **Non-Standard Path**: The service binary is placed in a non-standard directory (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`) which is not typical for system services.\n  - **Use of PowerShell**: PowerShell is often used for scripting and automation but is also a common tool for attackers to execute malicious commands.\n  - **Multiple Repetitions**: The same command is logged multiple times, possibly indicating an automated or repeated attempt.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Risks**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The creation of a new service can be used to **persist access** to the system, even after a reboot.\n- **Malicious Binary**: The executable `tarefa_logico.exe` may be malicious or part of a **malware dropper**, and its behavior is unknown based on this log alone.\n- **Lack of Logging Context**: The logs do not include any security-related alerts or file integrity checks for the binary file, which increases the risk of **undetected malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendations**\n\n#### **a. Analyze the Executable**\n- **Path**: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`\n- **Action**:\n  - Perform **static analysis** (e.g., using VirusTotal, YARA rules, or tools like PEiD).\n  - Perform **dynamic analysis** in a sandboxed environment.\n  - Check for **digital signatures** or **unknown publishers**.\n\n#### **b. Monitor for Anomalies**\n- Monitor the **execution of services** and **file modifications** in the directory `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`.\n- Use **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** tools or **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** systems to detect unusual behavior.\n\n#### **c. Investigate the PowerShell Script**\n- Review the **PowerShell script** for obfuscation or hidden commands.\n- Consider **blocking or restricting** PowerShell execution if it is not required for legitimate tasks.\n\n#### **d. Review System Services**\n- Use the **Services Manager** (`services.msc`) to inspect the **\"objeto_ativo\"** service.\n- Check its **description**, **startup type**, and **owner**.\n\n#### **e. Enable Logging and Alerts**\n- Enable **Windows Event Logging** for **Windows Defender**, **Microsoft Defender ATP**, or **SIEM tools**.\n- Monitor for **unusual service creation** or **unauthorized file access**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Summary**\n- A **new service** named **\"objeto_ativo\"** has been created and executed using a **PowerShell command**, pointing to a **non-standard binary**.\n- This is a **high-priority alert** and should be **investigated immediately**, as it may indicate **malware installation**, **system compromise**, or **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Isolate the system** if it is part of a production or sensitive environment.\n2. **Analyze the binary** `tarefa_logico.exe` for malicious content.\n3. **Check for other suspicious services** or processes.\n4. **Review Windows logs** (Security, System, and Application logs) for additional context.\n5. **Submit the binary** to threat intelligence platforms for analysis.\n\n---\n\nIf you have access to a **SIEM** or **EDR** tool, you can also search for related events such as:\n- **File creation** in the directory `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\`\n- **Service creation** via **registry changes**\n- **PowerShell execution** with obfuscation or unusual command-line arguments\n\nLet me know if you need help with the **analysis of the binary** or **further investigation**."}
