{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries with PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a common trick in malware to execute arbitrary code. The triggers are set to run at logon, which means the task will execute when a user logs in. The user is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, which gives the task elevated privileges. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights can be used to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nThen there are several entries with \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events, which might indicate changes to the system's registry or processes being monitored. However, the most concerning part is the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with these parameters. Each event has a different task name, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., which might be part of a campaign to create multiple tasks for persistence.\n\nAlso, there are entries about image loads, such as mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate, their loading in the context of PowerShell could be part of a more complex attack, like using .NET to execute code obfuscated within PowerShell scripts.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges using PowerShell is highly suspicious. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome creating a pipe), the combination of these PowerShell tasks with elevated rights and the use of calc.exe (a known test program but often used in malicious contexts) points to potential malicious activity. The confidence here would be high because the indicators are strong and consistent across multiple events. However, I should check if there's any possibility of false positives, but in this case, the pattern is too clear to ignore.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **highly suspicious activity** warranting investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Malicious Scheduled Tasks via PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple events show PowerShell commands creating **scheduled tasks** with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the payload (a common red flag for obfuscation or test code in malicious contexts).\n     - **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the user, with **RunLevel Highest** (elevated privileges).\n     - Task names like `\"unidade_ativo\"`, `\"registro_geral\"`, etc., suggesting **persistent, stealthy execution**.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n\n2. **.NET Framework DLLs Loaded in PowerShell**:\n   - Events show loading of `.NET` DLLs (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc.) in the context of PowerShell. While legitimate, this could indicate **.NET-based obfuscation or execution** of malicious code (e.g., using `System.Reflection` to bypass AV detection).\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry\/Process Monitoring**:\n   - Frequent \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" events may signal **post-exploitation activity** (e.g., modifying registry keys for persistence or monitoring processes).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Suspicious**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Scheduled tasks with admin privileges are a common technique for **long-term access** to a system.\n- **Elevation of Privilege**: Using `RunLevel Highest` suggests the attacker aims to **execute code with full admin rights**.\n- **Obfuscation via PowerShell**: The use of `calc.exe` (a harmless utility) in a malicious context is a **classic obfuscation tactic** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the source** of the PowerShell commands (e.g., check logs for `PowerShell.exe` process creation, parent processes, or network connections).\n- **Analyze the tasks** created (e.g., check `Task Scheduler` for suspicious entries).\n- **Check for .NET-based payloads** in memory or on disk (e.g., using tools like `ProcDump` or `Volatility`).\n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to confirm if this is part of a larger attack.\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level**\n- **High** (multiple overlapping indicators of compromise, including persistence, privilege escalation, and obfuscation). \n\nThis activity strongly suggests **malicious intent** and requires immediate forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Wait, those are legitimate Windows Defender files. So maybe that's normal, but I should check if there's any suspicious activity around them. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Then it's deleted. That could be part of a normal process, like a temporary script, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to execute malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not sure if that's suspicious here. Then the command line shows a PowerShell script that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, which is a benign executable, but the trigger is at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with highest privileges. That might be normal if it's part of a legitimate setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be a red flag. However, the user might be testing something here.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with registry value set events. Chrome modifying its own registry settings might be normal, but if it's done repeatedly or in unusual ways, it could be suspicious. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious changes here.\n\nThen there are a bunch of entries with the process as None and the task as 'Execute a Remote Command'. That seems odd because the process field is missing. Maybe the logs are incomplete or there's a parsing issue. However, having multiple such entries could indicate that some remote commands are being executed, which is a potential security risk. But without knowing the actual command details, it's hard to say for sure. However, the presence of these events might suggest some kind of remote execution, which is a common attack vector.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell activities, especially the scheduled task creation with high privileges, could be a sign of something. The numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events without process information are concerning. Even though some events might be legitimate, the combination of these events, especially the remote command executions, raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the presence of multiple suspicious activities makes it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events (potentially indicating remote code execution), and temporary PowerShell script creation\/deletion. These patterns may indicate malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

First, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious actors use WMI for persistence. However, taskschd.dll is a system file, so maybe that's normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Multiple registry changes might be normal, but if they're all from the same process, it could be suspicious. But there's no indication of malicious activity here yet.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, the Tasks directory is typically used by Task Scheduler. However, \"unidade_comum\" doesn't look like a standard Task Scheduler task name. That might be a red flag. Maybe an attacker is creating a task here.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None executing a remote command. That's concerning because if the process field is None, it might mean the event doesn't have process information, which could be a sign of evasion or a problem with logging. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the user's AppData and Downloads folders. Creating a startup profile file might be normal, but creating files in Downloads could be part of data exfiltration or setup. However, the file names here seem benign, like \"entrada_principal.txt\" and \"objeto_auxiliar.txt.\" Not sure yet.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry changes and image loads. Loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate, as those are part of Windows Defender. But multiple registry changes from Chrome might be normal if it's updating settings, but could also be part of a configuration change by an attacker.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal during setup. However, the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be unexpected. Maybe someone is trying to tamper with the configuration.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple registry changes, file creations in unusual locations, and some processes that are common but could be exploited. The most suspicious parts are the svchost.exe creating a task in the Tasks directory with a non-standard name, the remote command execution with no process, and the PowerShell creating files in Downloads. However, the other events seem to be normal system activities.\n\nBut I need to check if these events are part of a larger attack. For example, creating a task in the Tasks directory could be part of a scheduled task setup. If combined with remote command execution, it might indicate an attacker setting up persistence. However, without more evidence like network connections to malicious IPs or unusual process behaviors, it's hard to confirm.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate. There are some suspicious activities, but they could be benign. The presence of multiple registry changes and file creations in non-standard locations might warrant further investigation, but not enough to be highly confident. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows Tasks directory (unusual for standard operations), processes with no associated process information (e.g., 'Execute a Remote Command'), and PowerShell creating files in user Download directories.
