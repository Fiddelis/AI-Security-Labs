{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look for any patterns or anomalies. The logs show various processes like chrome.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe. Some entries mention network connections and DNS queries, which are normal for browsers. However, I notice multiple instances of svchost.exe and cmd.exe creating scheduled tasks with commands that launch calc.exe. \n\nWait, calc.exe is usually a harmless calculator app, but when it's being triggered by scheduled tasks created through cmd.exe, that might be suspicious. Also, there's a line where cmd.exe's command line includes creating a scheduled task named \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and another named \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". These names look like they might be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing is the file paths. Some entries mention urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll, which are legitimate system files, but the fact that they're being loaded or accessed could be normal. However, the repeated registry value sets by svchost.exe might indicate something trying to modify system settings.\n\nLooking at the process creation events, there's a schtasks.exe creating tasks with \/sc onlogon and \/sc onstart, which means they run when a user logs on or the system starts. If these tasks are executing calc.exe, that's not typical behavior. It's possible that calc.exe is being used as a payload here, or maybe it's a red herring.\n\nAlso, multiple entries have the same process and task, which might indicate a script or automated process. The use of \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" in the task triggers could be a way to execute arbitrary commands. Even though calc.exe itself is benign, the method of execution and the scheduling might be part of a larger attack, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nI should also check for any unusual file creations. There's an entry where svchost.exe creates a file in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon\" and another in \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". These paths are in the System32 directory, which is a common place for scheduled tasks, but the names are again suspiciously named with \"pacote\" which might be a language-specific term (like Portuguese) for \"package,\" possibly indicating obfuscation.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and other processes could be an indicator of configuration changes by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But the combination of scheduled tasks created with potentially malicious commands and the repeated events might be enough to flag this as interesting.\n\nConsidering all these points, the logs show activity that could be part of an attempt to establish persistence on the system through scheduled tasks. Even though some components are legitimate, the pattern and the names used might be indicative of a security incident. Therefore, this warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **potentially malicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Scheduled Task Creation:**\n   - Multiple instances of `schtasks.exe` creating tasks with obfuscated names (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`, `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`) and triggering `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`. \n   - **Why this is suspicious:** \n     - Scheduled tasks named with non-English terms (e.g., \"modulo\", \"pacote\") may indicate obfuscation or evasion.\n     - `calc.exe` is typically harmless, but its execution via scheduled tasks could be a **payload delivery mechanism** or a **red herring** to mask malicious activity.\n\n2. **Persistence Through `svchost.exe`:**\n   - `svchost.exe` (a legitimate Windows process) is involved in **file creation** in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\` directory. \n   - **Why this is suspicious:** \n     - `svchost.exe` is often exploited by malware to hide malicious behavior. \n     - Creating tasks in `System32\\Tasks\\` (a protected directory) may indicate **unauthorized persistence**.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple entries show `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` performing **registry value sets**. \n   - **Why this is suspicious:** \n     - Unusual registry changes could be part of **malware configuration** or **system hijacking**.\n\n4. **Command-Line Obfuscation:**\n   - The use of `\/sc onlogon` and `\/sc onstart` in `schtasks.exe` commands suggests **persistence mechanisms** that execute payloads at system startup or user login.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal vs. Suspicious Behavior:**\n- **Normal:** \n  - `chrome.exe` performing DNS queries and network connections.\n  - Legitimate system processes like `svchost.exe` and `schtasks.exe` interacting with the registry or files.\n- **Suspicious:**\n  - Repeated, obfuscated task creation with potentially malicious payloads (`calc.exe`).\n  - Unusual file creation in `System32\\Tasks\\` by `svchost.exe`.\n  - Frequent registry modifications by non-admin processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - Check the contents of the tasks created (e.g., `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`) to verify if they execute legitimate commands or hidden payloads.\n   - Look for signs of **code injection** or **malicious scripts** in the task definitions.\n\n2. **Analyze `svchost.exe` Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Procmon** to monitor `svchost.exe` for unexpected activity (e.g., network connections, file writes).\n   - Check if the process is part of a **malware family** known for hijacking system processes.\n\n3. **Check for Obfuscation:**\n   - Analyze the task names and command-line arguments for **language-specific patterns** (e.g., Portuguese terms like \"modulo\") that may indicate evasion tactics.\n\n4. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware detection tools to identify any **hidden malicious components**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **unusual persistence mechanisms** and **potential obfuscation**, which are strong indicators of **malicious activity**. While some processes are legitimate, the combination of suspicious task creation, registry modifications, and obfuscated naming justifies further investigation."}

The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are a lot of registry value set events, which are common in normal operations, but maybe not always. Then there's a file created event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if they're installing or configuring it. But then there's a file created by powershell.exe called 'unidade_ativo.txt'â€”that's a user-created file, maybe not suspicious. \n\nWait, looking at the processes, there's a lot of chrome.exe activity. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, but maybe in this case, it's being used for something else. However, the majority of the events are from chrome.exe with registry changes. But then there's also powershell.exe accessing processes, which could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. Let me check for any suspicious patterns. There's a 'File created' event for winlogbeat, which is a legitimate tool. The 'whoami.exe' process is also normal, as it's just displaying user info. The 'Image loaded' events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are part of Windows Defender, so that's normal too. \n\nHowever, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry in such a way. This could indicate that the process is being used for malicious purposes, like injecting code or modifying system settings. But is that enough? Also, there are several 'Process accessed' events from powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. \n\nBut the majority of the events don't seem to be overtly malicious. The presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be unusual, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the user is asking for investigation, maybe this is a case where the system is being monitored and these events are just normal. Alternatively, maybe the high number of registry changes from chrome.exe is a sign of something. \n\nBut considering that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious files, maybe this isn't interesting. The presence of legitimate tools and normal processes might mean that these events are just part of regular operations. However, the high number of registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a point of interest. \n\nHmm. The confidence here is a bit low. Maybe the classification is 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear malicious activity. The events don't show any obvious signs of compromise, like unexpected file creation or unusual process access. The 'unidade_ativo.txt' file is just a regular text file, and the other events are part of normal system operations. So, the justification would be that there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly routine system events (e.g., registry modifications, file creation, and process access) involving common processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, and svchost.exe. No clear indicators of compromise, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior are present. Legitimate activities such as file creation by winlogbeat and image loading of Windows Defender components are observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
