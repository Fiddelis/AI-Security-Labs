That might be okay if it's part of an installation, but I should check if that's expected. Then there's svchost.exe creating a tmp.edb file in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which seems normal for Windows Update activities.\n\nDiscord.exe has several events: file creation time changes, network connections, process accesses, and pipe creations.

The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll are also legitimate system files.\n\nThe only suspicious thing might be the reg.exe query for Discord's Run key, but that's a common system command.

A lot of NetworkConnect events could be normal if Discord is just connecting to its servers, but the sheer number might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a reg.exe command adding Discord to the Run registry key. That's suspicious because it's making Discord start automatically on boot, which is common in malware. Then there are multiple ProcessAccess events and RegistryEvent entries. The fact that reg.exe is modifying the registry to persist the application is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n\nAlso, Discord.exe is creating a file in the AppData directory, which is a common place for malware to store data. The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's part of a larger pattern. The repetition of NetworkConnect and PipeCreated events could indicate communication with a C2 server. \n\nPutting it all together: the registry modification for persistence, multiple network connections, and file creation in hidden directories are signs of a potential security threat.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to Discord.exe. There's a process creation, several image loads, file creations, and network connections. The first thing that stands out is that all the activities are from Discord.exe, which is a legitimate application. However, there are multiple instances of \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events. \n\nLooking at the file paths, most of them are within the Discord installation directory, which makes sense. There's a file created in the AppData folder, which is common for applications to store data. The network connections are also typical for Discord, as it's a communication app.\n\nBut wait, there's a mention of a temporary file in the Roaming directory. That might be normal too. However, the high number of \"Process accessed\" events could indicate something unusual. Normally, a legitimate application wouldn't have so many access events. Also, the command line for the process includes a lot of parameters, some of which might be related to GPU processes or other system settings. \n\nHowever, since all the files and processes are related to Discord and there's no mention of any malicious activity like file deletion, unusual registry changes, or connections to suspicious IPs, it's possible that this is just normal operation. But the sheer volume of events, especially the repeated \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that the logs are from a batch. Maybe this is part of a normal startup or update process. But the confidence here is a bit low because even though all events are from a legitimate process, the high frequency of certain events could be indicative of something. However, without more context, like seeing other processes or unexpected behavior, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because all the activities are related to a legitimate application, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The justification is that the events are consistent with normal Discord operations, even though there are many logs.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the events here involve Discord.exe. There are several instances where the \"File creation time changed\" rule is triggered, pointing to temporary files in the Discord Network directory. Then there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events related to Discord.exe, which might be normal if Discord is just running, but the repetition could be a red flag. Also, there are several \"Network connection detected\" events from Discord.exe. \n\nBut wait, Discord is a legitimate application that communicates over the network, so some of these might be normal. However, the multiple file creation time changes in temporary files might indicate something unusual. Maybe the application is modifying timestamps on files, which could be part of normal operations, but if done excessively, it might be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the other events, there's one from winlogbeat.exe related to a file creation in the Downloads directory. That seems normal as well. Then there are image loaded events for system files like urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll, which are part of Windows, so those are probably legitimate. \n\nHowever, the high number of \"Process accessed\" and \"Network connection detected\" events from Discord.exe might indicate that it's interacting with many processes or making many network connections, which could be a sign of malicious behavior. But I need to consider if this is typical for Discord. \n\nAlso, there are some entries with \"task\": \"None\" and process null, which might be noise or incomplete logs. But they don't seem directly relevant here. \n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the repeated file timestamp changes and numerous network connections could be worth investigating. However, since Discord is a legitimate app, it's possible that these events are part of its normal operations. The confidence here might be moderateâ€”there's some suspicious activity, but without more context, it's not definitive.

The majority of them are from Discord.exe with events like Network connection detected and Process accessed. Then there are a few other processes like winlogbeat.exe and sppsvc.exe.\n\nFirst, the repeated Network connection detected events from Discord.exe. Normally, Discord uses the internet for communication, so having multiple network connections might be normal. But if it's happening a lot, maybe there's something unusual. However, the logs don't show any specific malicious activity here, just the network connections.\n\nThen there's the File created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's not expected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother entry is from sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll. Sppsvc is related to Windows activation, and taskschd.dll is a legitimate system file. So that seems normal.\n\nThe svchost.exe event about a registry value set. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services. Without knowing which registry key was changed, it's hard to tell if that's suspicious. But again, without more info, it's hard to judge.\n\nThen there are multiple File creation time changed events from Discord.exe. Changing file timestamps could be part of normal operations, like caching or temporary files. The paths mentioned are in Discord's AppData directories, which makes sense for temporary files.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events are related to normal operations of Discord and other legitimate processes. There's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The repetition of network connections might be normal for a messaging app. The winlogbeat file creation is in a Downloads folder, but maybe the user is setting up the tool. Without additional anomalies like unexpected processes, unusual network destinations, or privilege escalations, this batch doesn't seem suspicious. So, I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of legitimate Discord.exe network activity and standard system process behavior (e.g., sppsvc.exe loading system DLLs, svchost.exe registry updates).
