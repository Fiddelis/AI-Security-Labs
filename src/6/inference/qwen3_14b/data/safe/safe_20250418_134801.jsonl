Maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's setup.exe creating a named pipe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The next entries are about services.exe and special logon events. The repeated \"User Account Management\" tasks might be normal system activity, but so many of them could indicate something, though maybe just a lot of log entries.\n\nThe PowerShell command line is interesting. It's checking for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That could be part of a legitimate script, but maybe it's trying to detect if certain drivers or installations are present. Not sure yet. Then, there's a file created by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That might be part of monitoring, but the path is in the Downloads directory, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries with registry value changes are common, but the command line for svchost.exe related to BthAvctpSvc is normal. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard for Internet Explorer, so that's probably okay.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the PowerShell script checking INF files, which might be looking for installation sections, and the winlogbeat file in the Downloads directory.

Microsoft Defender is a legitimate process, but loading this DLL might be normal. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file makes sense. But the path is in the Downloads folder. Maybe someone is configuring it, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again.

Still, repeated loading of the same DLL might be worth noting, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization folders. Delivery Optimization is part of Windows Update, so creating cache files is normal. The paths here seem standard, so probably benign.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an installer file. That's expected during an update. Then a File Delete logged event for a temporary file. That's normal cleanup.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe (Windows Defender) loading various DLLs and creating lock files.

These are typical in a normal system environment.\n\n2. **Normal System Operations:**\n   - **File creation** (e.g., `semver.js`, `clean.js` via `git.exe`) and **registry modifications** (e.g., by `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are consistent with user activities, software updates, or configuration changes.\n   - **DLL loading** (e.g., `taskschd.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) by legitimate processes (e.g., `MsMpEng.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`) aligns with standard Windows behavior.\n\n3. **No Anomalies Detected:**\n   - No **unusual file paths**, **unexpected network activity**, or **non-standard processes** are present.\n   - The **`process: null`** entry appears to be a placeholder or incomplete log entry but does not indicate a threat.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries reflect **normal system and user activities** (e.g., software updates, development workflows, log configuration). There is **no evidence of malicious behavior** or security incidents requiring further investigation. \n\n**Final Judgment:** ❌ **Not Interesting** (No actionable threats detected)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that a file was created in the node_modules\/semver\/functions directory by the git.exe process. The files are all named with different function names like compare-build.js, compare-loose.js, compare.js, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. Git is a version control system, and when you clone a repository or install packages, it might create files as part of the process. However, the node_modules directory is typically where npm packages are installed. The semver package is a common dependency for versioning, so the functions here are part of that package.\n\nBut wait, the events are all about files being created. Normally, when you install a package via npm, the files are extracted once, not created one by one. Also, git.exe is the process responsible here. If someone is using git to clone a repository, they might have a .git directory, but creating files in node_modules seems odd. Maybe the user is running git commands inside the node_modules directory, which isn't standard.\n\nAnother angle: the path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This looks like a student's project folder, possibly part of a course. The presence of semver suggests they might be working on a Node.js project. However, the fact that git.exe is creating these files in node_modules could indicate that the user is trying to commit or push changes to the semver package, which is a third-party library. That doesn't make sense because semver is a dependency, not something the user would modify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misconfiguration or a malicious activity where git is being used to inject files. But given that all the files are standard semver functions, it's more likely that this is part of a legitimate package installation or a normal git operation. However, the repetition of FileCreate events for each individual file might be a red flag. Typically, when a package is installed, the files are created as part of the extraction process, but if each file is logged as a separate event, that might be more detailed logging than usual.\n\nBut the classification here depends on whether this is abnormal. Since the user is in a student project, maybe they're just setting up their environment. The process is git.exe, which is legitimate. The files are in a standard location for npm packages. However, the fact that each file is being created individually might be a sign of something else, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user is not supposed to be modifying the semver package, then this could be a problem. But if they are working on a project that includes semver as a dev dependency, maybe they're making changes. However, the events don't show any modifications, just creation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think it's more likely a legitimate activity, even though the logging is detailed. The user might be using git in a way that's causing these files to be created, but unless there's a pattern of unauthorized access or unexpected behavior, it's probably not malicious. Therefore, the answer is that this is not suspicious and is likely part of a normal git operation in a project setup.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that the `git.exe` process created multiple files within the `node_modules\/semver\/functions` directory of a project located in a user's downloads folder. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and Files:**\n   - All events involve the `git.exe` process creating files named after functions (e.g., `compare.js`, `satisfies.js`) in the `node_modules\/semver\/functions` directory.\n   - These files are standard components of the [semver](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/semver) npm package, which is a widely used library for semantic versioning in Node.js projects.\n\n2. **Context of the Activity:**\n   - The files are part of a typical npm package (semver), which is commonly included as a dependency in Node.js projects.\n   - The `git.exe` process is legitimate and often used for version control. However, creating files in the `node_modules` directory (which is managed by npm) is unusual for `git.exe`, as this directory is typically populated by npm during installation, not by git operations.\n\n3. **Likely Explanation:**\n   - The activity is **likely benign** and part of a normal project setup. For example:\n     - The user may have initialized a Git repository in the project directory, and the `node_modules` folder (including semver) was already present due to an earlier `npm install`.\n     - Alternatively, the user might have run a `git add` or `git commit` command that inadvertently included the `node_modules` directory (though this is not standard practice, as `node_modules` is usually excluded via `.gitignore`).\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - **Unusual Behavior:** Git is not typically responsible for creating individual files in `node_modules`. This could indicate a misconfiguration or an attempt to manipulate the `node_modules` directory via git.\n   - **Lack of Context:** Without additional logs (e.g., git commands executed, user intent), it is challenging to definitively rule out malicious activity. However, the files themselves are standard and do not contain suspicious content.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** and part of a normal project setup, assuming the user is working on a Node.js project that includes the semver package. However, the involvement of `git.exe` in creating files within `node_modules` is atypical and warrants further investigation if there is no clear justification (e.g., intentional use of git for package management). No immediate security threats are evident from the provided logs.\n\n**Final Classification:**  \n✅ **Not Suspicious (Likely Legitimate)**  \n**Justification:** The files are standard components of a common npm package, and the activity aligns with typical project setup workflows, albeit with an unusual process (`git.exe`) interacting with `node_modules`."}

All the events are about file creation, and the process involved is git.exe. The files are part of the 'tcomb' package under node_modules. Now, git.exe is a normal process used for version control, so creating files as part of a Git operation might be expected. However, the number of files being created here is quite a lot.

The justification would be that these are normal files created by git during a clone, part of a legitimate software development workflow.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent standard file creation operations by git.exe during a typical package installation or clone process in a software development workflow.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created in the node_modules directory under tcomb's lib folder. The process responsible is git.exe. Now, git.exe is a normal process used for version control, so creating files during a clone or pull operation makes sense. The files mentioned are all JavaScript and TypeScript files, which are typical for a library like tcomb. \n\nBut wait, why are there so many files being created? Let me check the paths again. They're all in the same directory structure, which suggests that this is part of a standard installation or cloning of the tcomb package. Since git is involved, this could be a legitimate operation where the user is pulling down dependencies. There's no mention of any unusual activity, like files being executed or network connections to suspicious IPs. All the events are consistent with a normal git operation. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a possibility of a malicious use. Could git be used here to drop malicious files? But in this case, the files are standard library files. The names like isMaybe.js, isNil.js, etc., are typical utility functions. There's no indication of hidden files or unexpected file types. \n\nThe classification here is important. Since all events are part of a normal git operation and there's no suspicious behavior detected, this batch isn't interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because the pattern matches typical git activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent standard file creation operations by git.exe during a typical package installation in a node_modules directory. The files created are legitimate library files with normal names and no suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
