Such repetitive behavior merits closer inspection to determine if it's part of expected application functionality.\n\n2. **Process Legitimacy Check**:\n   - **Known Component**: Verify if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft or Office process. If it is not recognized, further investigation is necessary.\n   - **Unrecognized Process**: If the process is unauthorized, this could be indicative of malware or an attack vector attempting to persist on the system.\n\n3. **File Naming and Content**:\n   - The files have similar names with different hash-like suffixes, suggesting they might contain related content or configurations.\n   - Further analysis would involve checking file contents for any suspicious code or data structures that may indicate malicious intent.\n\n4. **Security Context**: Given the potential implications of unauthorized process activities on system security, classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" ensures it is flagged for a detailed follow-up by security analysts to rule out or confirm any threat.\n\n5. **Actionable Steps**:\n   - Conduct an integrity check on `SDXHelper.exe`.\n   - Investigate file contents and their intended use.\n   - Monitor the process's network activities for unexpected communications.\n   - Implement additional logging if necessary, for better visibility into future related events.\n\nBy classifying these logs as \"INTERESTING\", you prioritize them for a deeper dive to either confirm they are benign or take appropriate action in case of a threat."}
