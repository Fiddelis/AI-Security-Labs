There are several instances of 'Network connection detected' associated with 'chrome.exe', which is unusual for a web browser under normal circumstances. Additionally, there are processes like 'wmiprvse.exe', 'WMIC.exe', and 'svchost.exe' involved in actions such as setting registry values, loading images from paths related to legitimate system DLLs (e.g., urlmon.dll), and accessing files that may be used for persistence or privilege escalation.
