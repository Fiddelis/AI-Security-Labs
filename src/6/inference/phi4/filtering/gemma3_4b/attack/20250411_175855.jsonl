The presence of 'whoami.exe' running from a known system path with process creation flags is also noteworthy. Furthermore, directory searches for '.key' files using command-line tools like 'cmd.exe' and 'findstr.exe', along with attempts to load images from 'urlmon.dll' via 'calc.exe', suggest potential credential dumping or other malicious activities.
