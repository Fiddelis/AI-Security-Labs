{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' executing registry modifications, alongside a file creation event by 'powershell.exe', indicate potential unauthorized changes or scripting activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Processes Involved**: The batch includes multiple events involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `chrome.exe`.\n  \n- **Registry Modifications**:\n  - Several registry value set operations are noted with `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `chrome.exe`. Frequent registry modifications by these processes can suggest attempts to alter system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n  \n- **File Creation**:\n  - There is a file creation event by `powershell.exe` at an unusual path (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`). This could indicate the deployment of scripts or payloads intended to run automatically.\n\n- **Process Context**:\n  - The use of both `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` for system modifications is a common vector in many attack methodologies, including privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nGiven these indicators, the batch warrants further investigation into potential malicious activity. The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple suspicious activities that align with known malicious behavior patterns, but it's slightly less than certain due to the benign nature some of these actions can have if executed by a legitimate user for administrative purposes."}
