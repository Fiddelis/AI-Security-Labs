{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of standard operations such as Python modules loading and file creation by legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe, with no evident suspicious behavior or indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Python Processes**: The events related to `python.exe` involve loading DLLs, which is normal for Python applications starting up and using additional libraries.\n  \n- **Winlogbeat Process**: The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files indicates the configuration process of winlogbeat, a legitimate log collection tool. This is expected behavior when setting up or updating configurations.\n\n- **Registry Modification by RuntimeBroker.exe**: RuntimeBroker is a Windows system component associated with app permissions and background tasks. A registry modification event alone does not indicate malicious activity without additional context.\n\nOverall, the activities are routine for typical software operations on a Windows system, showing no signs of unusual or potentially harmful behavior."}
