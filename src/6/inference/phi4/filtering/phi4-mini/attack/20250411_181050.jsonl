The use of certutil.exe to encode and decode files, particularly with command lines involving calc.exe (which can be used for code injection), suggests attempts at obfuscating malicious payloads. PowerShell and cmd.exe are being used in ways that suggest automation of such tasks, including setting registry values and file manipulations that could establish persistence or evade detection. Additionally, SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll is unusual and indicative of possible DLL injection attacks, which can be used to execute malicious code covertly. The consistent activity related to chrome.exe, including numerous network connections and registry modifications, may indicate a compromised browser being used as part of the attack vector or persistence mechanism.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
