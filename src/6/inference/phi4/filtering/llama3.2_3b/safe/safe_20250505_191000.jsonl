'SDXHelper.exe' and 'EXCEL.EXE' loading critical system DLLs like combase.dll, mscoree.dll, and amsi.dll is unusual and could indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms or perform malicious activities under the guise of legitimate processes. Additionally, repeated file creations with the same name by EXCEL.EXE might suggest automated actions, potentially for data exfiltration. The presence of 'None' event type and a special logon event without process context adds to the suspicious nature.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
