These activities are common in legitimate scenarios but can also be indicative of script execution for malicious purposes, especially when combined. The sequence of creating and then deleting a temporary PowerShell script (FileCreate followed by FileDeleteDetected) is particularly suspicious. Additionally, the use of 'conhost.exe' to set registry values could be related to persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
