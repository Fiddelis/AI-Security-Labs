The files have different hash values, which suggests that they may be unique.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I noticed that most of the file paths are identical, except for a few characters at the end. Specifically, each file path contains a string in the format \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>\", where <hash> is a different hash value for each file.\n\nGiven this information, it's likely that these files are being generated by some sort of automated process or script, and they all have similar characteristics. Without more context or additional data, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose or significance of these files.\n\nTo help you better understand this data, I can provide a few observations:\n\n1. **File similarity**: As mentioned earlier, most file paths are identical except for the last few characters, which contain a unique hash value.\n2. **Process repetition**: The same process (`SDXHelper.exe`) is consistently creating these files with different hash values.\n3. **No clear pattern**: I couldn't identify any clear patterns or relationships between the file names, hash values, or creation times.\n\nTo take it to the next level, here are a few potential follow-up questions:\n\n* What is the purpose of `SDXHelper.exe`?\n* Are these files being used for some sort of caching or temporary storage?\n* Is there any additional metadata associated with each file that could provide more context?\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to explore this further or if you have any specific questions about this data."}
