{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This is a JSON log file that contains information about Windows events, including process and file activity. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n**Format**\n\nEach event is represented as a JSON object with three main keys: `process`, `winlog`, and `file`.\n\n* `process`: Contains information about the process that triggered the event.\n\t+ `name`: The name of the process (e.g., \"services.exe\", \"powershell.exe\").\n\t+ `command_line`: The command line arguments used to launch the process (optional).\n* `winlog`: Contains information about the Windows event.\n\t+ `task`: The type of event that occurred (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"Registry value set\", \"Image loaded\").\n\t+ `rule`: The specific rule that triggered the event (e.g., \"ProcessCreate\", \"RegistryEvent\", \"ImageLoad\").\n* `file`: Contains information about a file related to the event.\n\t+ `path`: The full path of the file.\n\n**Events**\n\nThere are several events in this log, but I'll highlight a few interesting ones:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell activity**: There are multiple events where PowerShell is launched with suspicious command-line arguments or files being created\/deleted. For example:\n\t* Event 13: A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) creates a file called `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` in the user's temporary folder.\n\t* Event 15: The same PowerShell process deletes this file.\n2. **System files accessed**: Some events indicate that system files are being loaded by processes, such as:\n\t* Event 10: A PowerShell process loads `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll`.\n3. **Registry modifications**: There are events where registry values are set or modified, which could indicate malicious activity:\n\t* Event 9: A registry value is set (rule: RegistryEvent).\n\n**Potential indicators of compromise**\n\nWhile this log doesn't contain conclusive evidence of a security incident, it does show some suspicious activity that could be investigated further. Some potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) from these events include:\n\n1. **Unusual PowerShell command-line arguments**: The event where PowerShell is launched with the argument `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` could indicate an attempt to delete a specific file or execute a malicious script.\n2. **System files loaded by unknown processes**: Events like Event 10, where an unknown process loads system files, could indicate malware activity.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a sample log and might not reflect the actual security posture of your organization. To determine whether these events are legitimate or malicious, you should investigate further using additional tools and resources."}
