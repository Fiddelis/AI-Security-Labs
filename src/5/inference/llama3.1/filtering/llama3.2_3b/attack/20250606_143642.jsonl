{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided output appears to be a log of system activity, likely generated by a security tool such as Windows Defender or Sysinternals. The log contains information about various processes, registry changes, and file system events.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe**: The powershell.exe process is repeatedly mentioned throughout the log. This suggests that the user or an application has launched PowerShell multiple times.\n2. **Script execution**: Powershell.exe executed scripts in the Temp directory (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`). These scripts might be malicious, as they are executed from a temporary location without any user interaction.\n3. **File deletion**: A file was deleted in the Temp directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`), which is likely related to the script execution.\n4. **Registry changes**: Powershell.exe made registry changes (e.g., `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`). While some registry changes are legitimate, others might be malicious.\n5. **Image loading**: Powershell.exe loaded images from various locations (e.g., `C:\\\\Windows\\\\assembly\\\\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\\\\System.Manaa57fc8cc#\\\\ac8d9bdd1d5d329adfe44a2bf5841c0b\\\\System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`). This is a normal behavior, but might indicate that the process is trying to load additional libraries.\n6. **Pipe creation**: Powershell.exe created pipes (e.g., `Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)`), which can be used for inter-process communication.\n\nTo better understand this log and determine if there's any malicious activity, it would be helpful to:\n\n* Review the PowerShell scripts executed in the Temp directory.\n* Investigate the registry changes made by Powershell.exe.\n* Analyze the images loaded by Powershell.exe (e.g., `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`).\n* Look for any suspicious file system events or network connections associated with Powershell.exe.\n\nIf you're interested in analyzing this log further, I can help you break it down and provide more context."}
