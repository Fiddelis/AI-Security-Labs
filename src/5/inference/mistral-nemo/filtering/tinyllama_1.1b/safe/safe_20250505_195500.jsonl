This happened repeatedly with different hash values, indicating that multiple instances of this file were loaded.\n   - These files are located in the following directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`\n\n2. **Security Group Management:**\n   - A security group management event occurred, but no additional details are provided.\n\nHere are some observations and potential concerns:\n\n- The repeated loading of `officeaicopilot-strings.min` files by the same process (SDXHelper.exe) could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code, as this behavior is unusual for legitimate software.\n- The use of hash values in the file names suggests that these may be uniquely generated files, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.\n- The location of these files within a Microsoft Office directory might imply that they are related to an office application, but their presence and repeated loading warrant further investigation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Scan the affected system:** Use up-to-date antivirus software or online scanners like VirusTotal to scan the mentioned files and directories for any malicious activity.\n2. **Isolate the affected process (SDXHelper.exe):** Temporarily disable or isolate this process to prevent it from loading these files until the nature of these files is determined.\n3. **Monitor the system:** Keep an eye on any unusual behavior, file changes, or network traffic that could indicate a compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's what we're seeing:\n\n1. **File Creation Events**: All of these events are related to file creation, specifically JavaScript files (with `.min.js` extension).\n\n2. **Process Involved**: The process involved in creating these files is `SDXHelper.exe`. This suggests that some software development tool or service (possibly a build system or an IDE) is generating these files.\n\n3. **File Content**: The filenames suggest that these are minimized JavaScript files, possibly related to the Office UI components (`officeaicopilot-*`), as they're prefixed with `officeaicopilot-` and suffixed with `-strings.min.js`.\n\n4. **User Affected**: The user affected is 'fiddelis', whose AppData folder these files are being created in.\n\n5. **Timeline**: Since there's no timestamp on these events, we can't determine the exact sequence or duration of these file creations, but they all happened one after another.\n\nHere's a list of the filenames for quick reference:\n\n- `officeaicopilot-4623918527307807399-strings.min.js`\n- ...\n- (and many more similar filenames)\n\nIf you're seeing these events and it's causing issues or you're concerned about them, you might want to investigate what software is generating these files and whether it's doing so appropriately. However, based on the information given, they seem like regular build artifacts for an Office UI component."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, it seems like there's a repetitive creation of files named \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxx.js\", where 'xxxx' is a unique hash. Here are some observations and possible explanations:\n\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` is creating these files repeatedly. This could indicate that the application is not properly cleaning up or managing its temporary files.\n\n2. **Unique Hashes**: Each file name contains a unique hash, suggesting that these are either cache or compilation files for different content.\n\n3. **Potential Issues**:\n   - **Memory\/Resource Leak**: The repetitive creation of files might indicate a memory or resource leak in the `SDXHelper.exe` process.\n   - **Cache Management**: If these files are caches, it's possible that the cache isn't being cleared properly, leading to this buildup.\n\n4. **Steps for Further Investigation**:\n   - Monitor the `SDXHelper.exe` process to see if its memory usage is increasing over time (indicating a leak).\n   - Check if there's a way to clear or manage these cache files within the application.\n   - If you're unable to manage this through the application, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or the software vendor for assistance.\n\n5. **Temporary Solution**: You might want to periodically delete these files (ensuring they aren't in use by the application) to prevent excessive buildup. However, this is not a permanent solution and you should investigate the root cause as mentioned above.\n\nHere's an example of how you can delete these files using PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Solutions\\16\\SolutionCache' -Recurse -Filter officeaicopilot-strings.min_* | Remove-Item\n```\n\nThis will delete all files matching the pattern `officeaicopilot-strings.min_*` in the specified directory and its subdirectories. Make sure to replace `'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Solutions\\16\\SolutionCache'` with the actual path where these files are located on your system."}
