This could be a component of Microsoft Office or part of another software suite you have installed on your system.\n\n3. **File Location**: The files are being saved in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c80af2e-59f6-4d71-a1f5-cceb8fa93100\\\n   ```\n   This is a typical location for cached or temporary files used by Microsoft Office applications.\n\n4. **File Hash**: The `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` file appears to be created in multiple variants, as indicated by the different hash values (e.g., `_4091ebb427771cbae3cfbb9d0093889a`, `_3a4675727e552daf92a42dd9b4e7b99c`, etc.).

This is likely a component of Microsoft Office responsible for handling solution packages and add-ins.\n\n3. **Duplicate Events:** Some events are duplicates, indicating that the same files were created multiple times:\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_685611aa6ca3885619e5aad962528da5.js`\n   - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_6cbe6a5cdc44c9a54cabe06c1615d335.js`\n\n4. **Other Processes:** There are also logs from the `chrome.exe` process, which could indicate that these file creation events were triggered while using Google Chrome.\n\nHere's an example of how these logs might look:\n\n```\n2022-01-01T12:34:56.787+0000  Information  SDXHelper.exe  FileCreated C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94\\SolutionPackage\\Resources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i.js\n2022-01-01T12:35:12.232+0000  Information  chrome.exe         FileCreated C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94\\SolutionPackage\\Resources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_685611aa6ca3885619e5aad962528da5.js\n2022-01-01T12:35:12.233+0000  Information  SDXHelper.exe  FileCreated C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94\\SolutionPackage\\Resources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_685611aa6ca3885619e5aad962528da5.js\n```\n\nIf these logs are causing concern, it might be a good idea to reach out to Microsoft support or check their official forums for any known issues related to `SDXHelper.exe` and duplicate file creation events."}

The files created are JavaScript (JS) files, as indicated by their `.js` extensions and the `officeaicopilot-strings.min` prefix in their names.\n\n3. The event type is \"File created\", suggesting that these JS files are being newly generated or updated.\n\n4. The process occurred between two timestamps (`2022-01-01T12:34:56.783Z` and `2022-01-01T12:35:09.421Z`), which is approximately 13 seconds.\n\nHere are a few examples of the files created:\n\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_7b5361e88d2c850f6a5b781e6352aa9b.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_935db65120957704104fe1969dc4cb0b.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_a582bcf06a89d7ce6aa896e4f2c606f6.js`\n\nSince the events are related to Office and JavaScript files, it might indicate some kind of scripting or automation task being performed by Microsoft Office. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose of these created files.\n\nIf you're concerned about the number of files created or the process creating them, I'd recommend monitoring this process and checking if it's causing any performance issues on your system. If it is, you might want to investigate further into why `SDXHelper.exe` is creating so many files or reach out to Microsoft support for assistance."}
