This could indicate an update or installation process for Microsoft Office.\n- The creation of these files occurred consecutively, suggesting a sequence of operations rather than random events.\n\n**Process: chrome.exe**\n- Created a temporary file named 'ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp' in the Downloads folder.

The SDXHelper events could be related to legitimate Microsoft Office processes, and the Chrome event appears normal for downloading\/caching a file.\n- However, if these events are followed by unusual behavior (e.g., unexpected system slowdowns, unexpected pop-ups or advertisements), further investigation may be warranted.\n\n**Further Action:**\nMonitor the system for any unusual behaviors.
