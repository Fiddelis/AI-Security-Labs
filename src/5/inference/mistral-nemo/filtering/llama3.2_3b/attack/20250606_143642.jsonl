{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **Process Creation:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was created with the command:\n     ```\n     \\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}\n     ```\n   This suggests that an archive file named `entrada_principal.zip` located in the temporary directory (`C:\\Windows\\Temp`) was deleted using PowerShell.\n\n2. **Registry Event:**\n   A registry value was set, but no details are provided about what specific value was changed or where it was stored.\n\n3. **File Access:**\n   - The process accessed a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`. This could be a temporary script file generated by PowerShell.\n   - The same file was deleted shortly after it was created, as indicated by the 'File Delete logged' event.\n\n4. **Pipe Created:**\n   A pipe (inter-process communication mechanism) was created.\n\n5. **Startup Profile Data File Creation:**\n   A new file was created at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. This could indicate that a startup script or profile was created for non-interactive sessions in PowerShell.\n\nThese events together suggest an automated process involving PowerShell scripts. The initial action (deleting `entrada_principal.zip`) and the creation of temporary files, pipes, and startup profile data indicate that some kind of automated task or malware is likely running. However, without additional context or further logs, it's difficult to determine the exact nature or intent of these activities.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if there are any suspicious scripts in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` folder.\n- Monitor for additional processes or files created by this PowerShell instance.\n- Look for other related events, such as network connections or file modifications."}
