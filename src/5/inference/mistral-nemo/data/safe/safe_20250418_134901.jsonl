{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of the activities that occurred on the system:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Service:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` started and created a new file `.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n   - It repeatedly created the same file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`), suggesting an error or infinite loop.\n\n2. **Process Activities:**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loaded the image `taskschd.dll`.\n   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` set various registry values.\n   - `notepad.exe` loaded the image `urlmon.dll` and set a registry value.\n   - `chrome.exe` performed multiple DNS queries and set several registry values.\n\n3. **File Activities:**\n   - A temporary file was created by `setup.exe` in the `SystemTemp` folder: `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n\n4. **Other Activities:**\n   - The system performed user account management tasks.\n   - Calculator.exe set a registry value.\n\nSome observations and potential concerns:\n\n- The repeated creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` by `winlogbeat.exe` might indicate a configuration issue or error in the winlogbeat service.\n- Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` setting registry values could suggest unusual activity, although this might not necessarily be malicious.\n- `chrome.exe` performing multiple DNS queries and setting many registry values could indicate aggressive browser behavior or extensions\/add-ons running.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file to understand why it's being created repeatedly.\n- Review the registry values set by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe` to ensure they are legitimate and expected.\n- Monitor the system for any unusual behavior or performance degradation."}
