Further investigation is needed:\n  - Check if winlogbeat was supposed to run at this time by the user or an automated script.\n  - Verify that no unauthorized changes have been made to the system's configuration or files related to winlogbeat.\n  - Monitor winlogbeat.exe's activities and network connections for any unusual behavior."}
