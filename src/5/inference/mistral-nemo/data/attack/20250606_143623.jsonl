{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"It seems like you're sharing some JSON data containing process and Windows event logs. Here's a breakdown of the events:\n\n1. **Process Events:**\n   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` and `services.exe` were started.\n   - A PowerShell script was executed multiple times with the command line:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n     This script creates a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\", sets its binary path to `tarefa_logico.exe` located in the specified directory, and starts the service.\n\n2. **Windows Event Logs:**\n   - Several events related to the Windows Update Agent occurred.\n   - Some provider lifecycle and engine lifecycle events were recorded, which are likely associated with the execution of the PowerShell script creating the new service.\n\nHere's a summary of the potential threat or unusual activity:\n- The repeated creation and starting of a new Windows service using PowerShell is suspicious. The script was executed 8 times in quick succession, which could indicate an attempt to create a persistent backdoor or malware by installing it as a service.\n- The service name \"objeto_ativo\" translates to \"active_object\", which might be a red flag as it's not a typical Windows service name and could suggest malicious activity.\n- The binary path points to `tarefa_logico.exe`, located in an unusual directory (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`), suggesting that the file may have been placed there intentionally by an attacker.\n\nYou should investigate further to determine if the created service is malicious and take appropriate action, such as disabling or removing the service if it's found to be malicious. Also, consider reviewing your system for any signs of unauthorized access or infection by malware."}
