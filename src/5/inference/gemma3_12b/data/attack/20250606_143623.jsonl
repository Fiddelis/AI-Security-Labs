{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided logs show a concerning sequence of events, strongly suggesting malicious activity. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n**1. Initial Infection\/Persistence Mechanism (Likely a PowerShell Script)**\n\n*   **`{\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}` (Repeated 6 times):**  This is the critical part.  This shows a PowerShell command being executed repeatedly.  Let's dissect it:\n    *   `powershell.exe`:  Indicates a PowerShell script is being run.\n    *   `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`:  This PowerShell command is *creating a new Windows service* named \"objeto_ativo.\"  The critical part is `-BinaryPathName`.  This specifies that the service will execute the file `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.  **This is a huge red flag.** Legitimate software rarely creates services in this way, and the path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base`) is highly suspicious (likely a custom path, not standard Windows locations).\n    *   `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  This immediately starts the newly created service.\n    * The \"Engine Lifecycle\" message at the end also suggest that a process has been started.\n\n**2. Other Notable Events (Likely Related to Infection\/Ongoing Actions)**\n\n*   **File Deletion (most concerning):** The first line of the log records the deletion of a file. Malware often deletes files to cover its tracks or to disrupt system operations.\n*   **Registry Modifications:** The repeated registry modifications suggest the malware is configuring itself or making changes to the system.\n*   **Process Creation:**  The creation of `sppsvc.exe` and loading of `taskschd.dll` could be related to scheduling tasks or executing malicious code.\n*   **Service Creation and Startup:** The creation and immediate startup of a new service (\"objeto\\_ativo\") is a strong indicator of persistence.  This allows the malware to automatically run every time the system starts.\n\n**Analysis and Interpretation**\n\n*   **Malware Persistence:** The core objective of the script seems to be to establish persistence by creating a new Windows service that runs with elevated privileges.\n*   **Custom Executable:**  The `tarefa_logico.exe` file is almost certainly a custom-built executable designed to carry out the malicious actions.  It's crucial to find and analyze this file (if possible) to understand exactly what it's doing.\n*   **Obfuscation:**  The unusual file path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\...`) suggests the attackers are trying to hide the location of their malicious executable.  \"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", and \"entrada_base\" are not standard Windows folder names.\n*   **Potential for Further Damage:** Depending on what `tarefa_logico.exe` is designed to do, the system could be at risk of data theft, ransomware, botnet participation, or other malicious activities.\n\n**Recommendations for Remediation**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the infected system from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Malware Scan:** Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/antimalware program. However, be aware that custom malware may evade detection by standard antivirus software.\n3.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Ideally, a digital forensics expert should be consulted to perform a more thorough analysis of the system, identify the root cause of the infection, and determine the extent of the compromise.\n4.  **Examine Scheduled Tasks:**  Check the Task Scheduler (taskschd.dll is referenced).  Look for any tasks named \"objeto\\_ativo\" or with suspicious descriptions.  Disable or delete them.\n5.  **Check Services:**  Open the Services app (services.exe) and look for the \"objeto\\_ativo\" service.  Disable and delete it.\n6.  **Review Startup Programs:**  Examine the list of programs that start automatically when the system boots.  Look for anything suspicious.\n7.  **Registry Analysis:** Examine the registry, focusing on keys related to the service.\n8.  **File Recovery:**  If possible (and if the deleted file was important), attempt to recover it from a backup or shadow copy.\n9.  **System Rebuild:**  In severe cases, it may be necessary to rebuild the system from scratch to ensure complete removal of the malware.\n\n**Important:**  This is a serious infection. Taking these steps will help mitigate the damage and prevent future attacks.  Do not attempt to remove the malware yourself unless you have experience with malware removal.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide more tailored advice, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What operating system is the system running (Windows 10, Windows 11, etc.)?\n*   Are there backups of the system or data?\n*   What is the business's level of technical expertise?"}
