{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data and analyze what's happening. This appears to be a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a structured summary with explanations and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs):\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nA PowerShell script was executed, seemingly attempting to remove a file and likely performing other malicious actions (though the full extent is obscured). It's likely that the PowerShell script was intended to evade detection, remove traces of itself, and potentially perform further malicious actions that are not apparent in this log snippet. The script is likely part of a larger attack chain.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown & Analysis:**\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Execution:**\n   *  `{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe', 'command_line': '...'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}` -  This indicates the initial execution of the PowerShell process.  The specific command-line arguments are obfuscated, but it's the starting point of the attack.\n\n2. **Registry Modification & Service Interaction:**\n   * `{\"process\":\"{'name': 'services.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}`- Suggests modifications to registry values, possibly setting permissions or controlling services. This is a very common technique used by attackers.\n   * `{\"process\":\"{'name': 'sppsvc.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll'}\"}` -  Interaction with the Task Scheduler service.  Malware often uses the Task Scheduler to establish persistence, ensuring it runs even after a system reboot.\n\n3. **Obfuscated File Removal:**\n   * `{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe', 'command_line': '...'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}` -  This is a key log entry. The command line is heavily obfuscated. The script seems to be designed to self-delete:\n   * `{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1'}\"}` - The script deleted a file located at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.  The name of the file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is very suspicious.  It's likely a temporary file used by the script, and its deletion is an attempt to erase traces of the attack.\n\n4. **DLL Loading (Potential for Further Malicious Activity):**\n   * The PowerShell script loaded several DLLs from the system, including `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll`.\n     * `mscoreei.dll` and `clr.dll`:  These are part of the .NET Framework and are often used by malware to execute code and manipulate the system.\n     * `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`:  This is a core DLL for PowerShell, which means the script has full access to PowerShell's functionality.\n     * `MpOAV.dll`:  This DLL is associated with Microsoft Platform AV. Malware may attempt to interact with it to disable or bypass antivirus protection.  Loading this file can be concerning.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **File Path:** `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` - This is the most crucial IOC.  Monitor for this file's creation and deletion.\n*   **PowerShell Command-Line Obfuscation:** The obfuscated command-line arguments in the initial PowerShell execution are a strong indicator of malicious activity.  Further analysis of the full command is required.\n*   **DLL Loading:**  The loading of `MpOAV.dll` should be investigated.\n*   **Registry Modifications:**  The `services.exe` activity needs further examination to understand what registry keys were modified.\n*   **User Account:** `fiddelis` â€“ The script is using the `fiddelis` user account. Investigate this account for suspicious activity.\n*   **Obfuscation Patterns:**  The naming convention of the deleted file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) suggests a deliberate attempt at obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Full System Scan:** Run a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software.\n3.  **Forensic Analysis:**  Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to determine the scope of the attack and identify other compromised files.\n4.  **Review Registry Changes:**  Examine the registry changes made by `services.exe` to understand the attacker's actions.\n5.  **Analyze PowerShell History:** Check the PowerShell history for more details about the executed commands.\n6.  **Monitor User Account:** Closely monitor the `fiddelis` user account for any suspicious activity.\n7.  **Review System Logs:**  Examine other system logs (e.g., Event Viewer) for additional clues about the attack.\n8.  **Hunt for Related Activity:** Search other systems on the network for similar activity or IOCs.\n9. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Implement or enhance EDR capabilities to detect and respond to threats more effectively.\n10. **Implement Script Policy:** Enforce PowerShell script execution policies to limit the ability of attackers to run malicious scripts.\n\n\n\nTo help me provide more specific guidance, could you tell me:\n\n*   What is the overall security posture of your environment?\n*   What are your incident response procedures?\n*   Do you have access to more detailed logs?"}
