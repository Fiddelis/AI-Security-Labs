The repeated file creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) along with the ExecutionPolicy Bypass command line suggest a potential attempt to execute scripts without proper security checks. The numerous DLL loads by PowerShell also warrant investigation. While some activity could be benign, the overall pattern raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
