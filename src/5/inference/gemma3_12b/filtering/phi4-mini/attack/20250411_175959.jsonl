The PowerShell activity also involved loading numerous .NET framework DLLs, a common tactic for obfuscation and execution. The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script also suggests an attempt to evade detection.  The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events also hint at potentially suspicious behavior.
