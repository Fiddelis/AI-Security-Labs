{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log shows a series of actions, likely malicious, performed by a PowerShell script. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, and what the implications are:\n\n**Initial Infection & Setup:**\n\n*   **`Dism.exe` File Operations:**  `Dism.exe` is a Windows System Image Manager. It's being used to delete several DLL files within a temporary directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`).  This suggests the attacker is removing components, possibly to cover their tracks or prevent detection. The deleted files (`WimProvider.dll`, `None`, etc.) are likely related to system image handling or are DLLs used by the initial payload.\n*   **`Powershell.exe` Initial Execution:**  The first execution of `powershell.exe` creates a PowerShell process.  The log entry \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\" indicates this is when the script initially starts running.\n\n**Malicious Activity & Payload Execution:**\n\n*   **`Whoami.exe`:**  The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests the attacker is trying to determine the current user's privileges.\n*   **`Powershell.exe` Persistence:** A startup profile data file is created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`. This is a persistence mechanism â€“ the script will automatically re-run whenever a user logs in or the system restarts.  This is a key indicator of a persistent threat.\n*   **File Deletion:** `powershell.exe` executes the command `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`.  This is highly significant.  It's deleting a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` from the user's temporary directory.  **This suggests the initial payload was likely contained within this ZIP file.** The `-Force` parameter ensures the deletion happens without prompting.\n\n**.NET Framework Involvement:**\n\n*   **Image Loads:** The `powershell.exe` process loads several .NET Framework DLLs.  This confirms that the PowerShell script utilizes the .NET Framework for some of its operations.\n\n**Key Indicators and Severity:**\n\n*   **DLL Deletion with Dism.exe:** Unusual use of `dism.exe` to delete system files is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n*   **ZIP File Deletion:** The deletion of `entrada_principal.zip` reveals that this file contained an initial payload. The attacker wants to remove this evidence.\n*   **Persistence Mechanism:**  The creation of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` ensures the malicious script survives reboots.\n*   **.NET Framework Usage:** This suggests the script uses advanced techniques or has further dependencies.\n*   **Obfuscation:** The `-Force` parameter hides the operation from user intervention.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network.\n2.  **Run a Full System Scan:**  Use a reputable anti-malware solution for a thorough scan.\n3.  **Check Startup and Scheduled Tasks:**  Examine startup programs, scheduled tasks, and registry entries for any unusual or suspicious entries.\n4.  **Review Recent User Activity:**  Look for any unusual user activity, such as unexpected file modifications or logins.\n5.  **Restore from Backup:** Ideally, restore the system from a known clean backup.\n6.  **Rebuild the System:** If a clean backup is unavailable, consider reformatting and reinstalling the operating system.\n7.  **Investigate Lateral Movement:**  Determine if the attacker has compromised other systems on the network.\n\n\n\n**To help me provide a more detailed analysis, could you tell me:**\n\n*   What is the context of this log? Where did it come from (security information and event management (SIEM) system, antivirus logs, etc.)?\n*   What is the intended functionality of this system?\n*   Have you observed any other unusual behavior on the system or network?"}
