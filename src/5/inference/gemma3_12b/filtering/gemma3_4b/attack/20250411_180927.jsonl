While `net1.exe` is likely a typo or a misconfigured script, the repeated attempts to add users and groups with distinct names, along with registry modifications, suggest potential unauthorized account manipulation. The presence of PowerShell execution and multiple registry modifications further increases suspicion of malicious activity.
