The usage of `cmd.exe` with complex command lines and the creation\/execution of files in temporary directories further raises concerns. The repeated network connections by `chrome.exe` could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control traffic.  The inclusion of `SDXHelper.exe` and related DLL loading warrants further investigation, although some DLLs are standard system files.
