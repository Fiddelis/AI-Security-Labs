{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"This log data shows several suspicious activities, primarily involving the creation and management of a Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\" using PowerShell.  Here's a breakdown and analysis, categorized by severity and potential implications:\n\n**1. High Severity - Potential Malicious Activity (Service Creation & Management):**\n\n* **The core issue:**  The repetitive PowerShell commands repeatedly create and start a service named `objeto_ativo`. This is highly concerning.  Services persist across reboots and can run with elevated privileges.\n* **Command Breakdown (repeated):**\n   ```powershell\n   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command \"New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"\"\n   ```\n    * `powershell.exe`: The PowerShell interpreter is being used.\n    * `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`: While this *appears* restrictive, it can be bypassed.  It *might* indicate an attempt to obscure the true nature of the activity.\n    * `New-Service`: This cmdlet creates a Windows service.\n        * `-Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  Specifies the name of the service. \"Objeto_ativo\" suggests something \"active object,\" potentially masking its real purpose.\n        * `-BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`: This is *critical*. It's the path to the executable that the service will run.  `tarefa_logico.exe` needs to be *immediately* investigated.  The path itself (`C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\`) is also suspicious - unusual folder names are often used to hide malicious code.  **This is the primary focus of your investigation.**\n    * `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: Starts the newly created service.\n* **Why it's dangerous:**\n    * **Persistence:**  The service will likely run automatically on system startup, ensuring continuous operation.\n    * **Privilege Escalation:** Services often run with System privileges, providing the malicious executable with extensive control over the system.\n    * **Malware Delivery\/Execution:** `tarefa_logico.exe` is the likely payload. It could be:\n        * **A full-fledged trojan:** Designed to steal data, install additional malware, or perform other malicious actions.\n        * **A downloader:**  Downloads additional malware from a remote server.\n        * **A keylogger:** Records keystrokes.\n        * **A remote access trojan (RAT):** Provides attackers with remote control over the system.\n\n**2. Moderate Severity - PowerShell Echo\/Debugging:**\n\n* **Command:** `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`\n* **Analysis:**  This seems to be a simple command to print \"Final result: 1\" to the console.  It's likely used for debugging the service creation process or as a confirmation that a particular action has been completed.\n* **Why it's concerning:** Frequent execution of PowerShell commands indicates a scripted process is actively running. While the individual command isn't malicious, it suggests the presence of a larger, potentially malicious script.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediately Quarantine `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe`:**  Move this file to a secure location and analyze it in a sandbox environment (e.g., a virtual machine without network access).  Use tools like VirusTotal, a disassembler (e.g., IDA Pro, Ghidra), or a behavioral analysis tool to understand its function.\n2. **Disable\/Delete the \"objeto_ativo\" Service:** Use `services.msc` or PowerShell (`Stop-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"; Remove-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`) to disable and delete the service.  *Do this after isolating `tarefa_logico.exe`.*\n3. **Review the Registry:**  The service is likely registered in the Windows Registry (typically under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`).  Examine these entries to confirm the service's configuration and potentially identify the script that created it.\n4. **Investigate the PowerShell Scripts:**  Find the script that's executing these PowerShell commands.  Search the system for files containing the PowerShell code.  Look for scheduled tasks or startup scripts that might be running it.  This is crucial to understand the scope of the compromise.\n5. **Scan for Rootkits:**  The presence of a persistent service indicates a potential rootkit infection. Run a thorough system scan using a reputable anti-rootkit tool.\n6. **Check for Scheduled Tasks:** Review scheduled tasks to see if the PowerShell commands are being executed automatically.\n7. **Review Network Connections:**  Monitor network connections to identify any suspicious communication from the infected system.  The malware might be communicating with a command-and-control server.\n8. **Implement PowerShell Restrictions:**  Consider tightening PowerShell execution policies and restricting access to sensitive system resources.\n9. **Incident Response Plan:** Follow your organization's incident response plan. This should include containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.\n10. **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of running suspicious scripts or opening attachments from unknown sources.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **\"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", \"entrada_base\":** These folder names are likely designed to obfuscate the malicious activity. They's typical of techniques used to avoid detection.\n* **The presence of `tarefa_logico.exe` is the key:** Everything else is supporting evidence.\n* **Don't assume anything is safe:**  Thoroughly investigate all aspects of the infection.\n\n\n\nThis situation requires immediate and thorough investigation. The creation of a persistent service with an unknown executable is a strong indicator of a serious compromise.  Take immediate action to contain the threat and prevent further damage."}
