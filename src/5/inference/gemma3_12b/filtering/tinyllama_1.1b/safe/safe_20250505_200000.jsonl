Additionally, `WindowsCamera.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` are suspicious due to the association with potentially malicious downloads.  The repeated 'Special Logon' events and `winlogbeat.exe` file creation further contribute to the potential for investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
