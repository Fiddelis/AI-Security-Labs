The creation of tasks with names like \\\"pacote_comum\\\", \\\"modulo_principal\\\", and \\\"unidade_ativo\\\" suggests a potential coordinated malicious campaign. Frequent Chrome.exe activity, combined with suspicious PowerShell and task scheduling events raises a strong indication of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
