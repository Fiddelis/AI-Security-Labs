Additionally, a powershell script creation is logged, although the content is unknown. The repeated use of `net.exe` and `cmd.exe` for user\/group management, alongside powershell activity, suggests potential unauthorized privilege escalation or account manipulation. While standard application activity is also present, the user management attempts raise suspicion and warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
