{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the events, focusing on suspicious activity and potential indicators:\n\n**Overall Summary:** This appears to be a script execution designed to evade detection (potentially malware). It involves PowerShell, deletion of files, modification of registry values, and attempts to avoid antivirus.\n\n**Detailed Analysis**\n\n*   **Initial Execution:** `powershell.exe` is the primary tool used.\n*   **File Deletion:** `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:  This is a very significant action. It suggests the script is deleting an archive file (likely containing the payload).  The `-Force` parameter ensures it's deleted without confirmation, indicating a deliberate attempt to hide the initial file.\n*   **Script Policy Bypass:** `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`:  The script is explicitly trying to circumvent PowerShell's default security. `Restricted` is the most restrictive policy. Specifying it overrides the local policy, and is a common tactic to get code to run when it otherwise would be blocked.\n*   **Registry Modification:** A registry value is set - this could be used to persist the script or alter system behavior. The nature of the change is unknown but is highly suspicious.\n*   **File Creation:** The creation of a file in the PowerShell startup directory suggests a persistence mechanism.  The script might attempt to run automatically on system startup.\n*   **Evading Detection:** Loading of `MpClient.dll` implies an attempt to interact with or potentially disable Windows Defender.\n*   **`whoami.exe`** likely used to check privileges or to hide what PowerShell is doing.\n\n**Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity**\n\n*   **File Deletion:** Immediate deletion of a potentially large file (`.zip`) is a red flag.\n*   **PowerShell Scripting:**  Extensive use of PowerShell.  While PowerShell is legitimate, it's a favorite tool for malicious actors due to its flexibility.\n*   **Execution Policy Override:** Explicitly overriding PowerShell's security policy.\n*   **Persistence Attempts:**  The creation of a file in the PowerShell startup directory, trying to persist the script's effects.\n*   **Antivirus Interaction:** Attempting to load `MpClient.dll`, potentially interfering with Windows Defender.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   **Isolate the System:**  Immediately disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread.\n*   **Forensic Analysis:**  Perform a full forensic analysis of the system's hard drive, including memory dumps.\n*   **Review Registry:** Thoroughly review recent registry changes.\n*   **Scan with Multiple AV\/EDR:** Run comprehensive scans using multiple antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.\n*   **Honeypot\/Sandboxing:** Consider analyzing the suspicious files in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe their behavior.\n*   **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement stricter monitoring and auditing of PowerShell execution on all systems.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot. This analysis is based on the provided data and should not be taken as definitive proof of malicious activity. A qualified security professional should perform a full investigation."}
