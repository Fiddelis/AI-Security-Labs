Specifically, there are multiple instances of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) being used to compile and execute code, followed by file creation and image loading. The commands involve paths with unusual or suspicious names like 'modulo_secundario', 'objeto_comum', and 'componente_ativo', strongly suggesting custom compiled code. The repeated registry and pipe modifications by `chrome.exe` are also concerning and could indicate browser hijacking or malicious extension activity. Coupled with PowerShell process access, this warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
