The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe, along with the execution of `sc.exe` to start the Windows Update service, and the presence of `whoami.exe` suggest reconnaissance and potential privilege escalation attempts. Multiple Chrome.exe events are also present, though their relevance is currently unclear but warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
