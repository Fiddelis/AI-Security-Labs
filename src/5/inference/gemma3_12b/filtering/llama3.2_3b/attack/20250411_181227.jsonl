The repetitive nature of these scheduled task creation attempts (varying only in the task name) suggests potential malicious activity, likely persistence mechanism or reconnaissance.  Additionally, the 'Execute a Remote Command' event logged is suspicious. The mscoree.dll and related .NET framework DLL image loads also indicate potential scripting activity and .NET based payloads.
