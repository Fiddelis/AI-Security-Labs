Some of the commands look suspicious. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete a process called notepad.exe. That might be part of a malicious action. Also, there's a line where they copy sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe, which I remember is related to something called \" Sticky Keys\" being exploited. That's a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThen there's the schtasks.exe being used to delete a scheduled task named win32times. That could be part of removing evidence or setting up persistence. The repeated use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events might indicate someone trying to access or manipulate processes. Also, the image loaded events pointing to urlmon.dll and taskschd.dll—those are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded in unusual contexts, it could be a red flag.\n\nBut wait, some of these are normal processes.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a Registry value set. That's a common event, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's cmd.exe being created, which is normal. But then there are multiple instances of powershell.exe loading images like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, clrjit.dll. Wait, those are all .NET framework components. Loading them might be normal if PowerShell is running .NET code, but maybe not always. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script. Creating a script in Temp could be a red flag, especially if it's being executed.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries with command_line showing powershell.exe executing scripts that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the use of \"..\" suggests path traversal, which might be a way to access parent directories. That could be a sign of something trying to access files in unexpected locations. Also, the names of the files and directories are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or could indicate the attacker is targeting a specific region, but that's speculative.\n\nThen there's the event where a file is created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be normal if someone is setting up monitoring, but the path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't typical for a log shipper. However, the user might be installing it there temporarily.\n\nAnother point is the multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command_line. That might be part of a script that's being tested or run multiple times. Also, the fact that PowerShell is being used to check for the existence of these .bat files repeatedly might be part of a larger script or a malicious activity trying to find specific files to execute.\n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The key points here are: multiple PowerShell processes, loading .NET DLLs, creating temporary scripts, and checking for .bat files with suspicious paths. However, some of these could be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and checking for files is normal. But the combination of creating a script in Temp and checking for .bat files with path traversal might indicate an attempt to execute a malicious script or access hidden files.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple similar command_lines with different paths might suggest a pattern. The use of \"..\" in the paths could be an attempt to bypass directory restrictions or access files that aren't directly accessible. That's a common tactic in attacks. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But given that the user is asking for whether this is interesting for investigation, the answer would be yes because there are multiple suspicious activities that could indicate a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities warranting further investigation:\n\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation**: A temporary PowerShell script (`.ps1`) is created in the system's Temp directory, which is a common tactic for malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Path Traversal in File Checks**: Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` with paths containing `..` (e.g., `C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\...`), suggesting attempts to access files in parent directories, which could indicate directory traversal or evasion techniques.\n\n3. **Unusual File Naming and Paths**: The presence of `.bat` files with non-standard, possibly obfuscated paths (e.g., `tarefa_base_script.bat`) and Portuguese-language directory names may hint at targeted activity or obfuscation.\n\n4. **Frequent PowerShell Execution**: Repeated use of PowerShell to check for these files could imply automated probing or preparation for execution of malicious code.\n\nWhile some activity (e.g., `.NET` DLL loading) is normal for PowerShell, the combination of script creation, path traversal, and repetitive file checks raises concerns about potential malicious intent. **This warrants further analysis to rule out adversarial activity.** \n\n**Answer:** Yes, the events are suspicious and require investigation due to the combination of script creation, path traversal, and repetitive file checks."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of ImageLoaded, which is normal because PowerShell often loads .NET assemblies. For example, mscoreei.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll are part of the .NET framework, so that's expected. But then there are FileCreate and FileDelete events. The files being created are in the Temp directory and Downloads folder. The names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 and elemento_padrao.txt might be temporary files, but the deletion of the Temp file after creation could be suspicious. Why create and delete a file quickly? Maybe trying to hide activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that use New-Item and Set-Content. These commands are creating files and writing \"dir\" into them. The paths mentioned are a bit convoluted with multiple ..\\ escapes, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. For example, \"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\" simplifies to \"C:\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\". This kind of path manipulation is sometimes used by malware to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events where PowerShell is creating files in various directories, which might be part of a script that's spreading or executing commands. The repetition of similar commands in different paths could indicate an automated process, possibly malicious. However, some of these could be legitimate scripts run by the user or applications. But the combination of file creation, deletion, and obfuscated paths raises a red flag.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender's MpClient.dll being loaded is normal, but if there's any unusual activity around that, it might be worth checking. However, in this case, it's just an ImageLoad event, so probably benign.\n\nThe Chrome.exe events are just Provider Lifecycle and Provider Lifecycle, which I think are related to event logging and not necessarily malicious. So, the main focus is on PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell scripts creating and deleting files with obfuscated paths, repeated patterns in the commands, and the use of temporary directories. These are common indicators of malicious activity, such as script-based attacks or malware trying to execute commands without leaving obvious traces. However, without more context, like the user's environment or other logs, it's a bit hard to be 100% certain. But based on the given data, this seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity with Obfuscated Paths**:\n   - Multiple `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands in PowerShell scripts create files in obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`). The use of `..\\` suggests an attempt to **obfuscate the actual target path**, a common tactic in malware to evade detection.\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and subsequently deleted. This pattern is often seen in **malicious scripts** that execute payloads and then clean up traces.\n\n3. **Repetitive Script Patterns**:\n   - The same PowerShell commands (`New-Item` followed by `Set-Content` with `\"dir\"` as the value) are repeated across different directories. This could indicate **automated or scripted activity**, potentially for persistence, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.\n\n4. **Unusual File Naming**:\n   - Files like `objeto_temporario_script.bat` and `registro_secundario_script.bat` use non-standard naming conventions, which may hint at **custom or malicious scripts** rather than legitimate system or user-generated files.\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Legitimate Activity**: PowerShell is a common tool for administrative tasks, and temporary file creation\/deletion is normal in some workflows. However, the **obfuscation and repetition** here are red flags.\n- **Malicious Potential**: The pattern aligns with **script-based attacks** (e.g., downloading and executing payloads, establishing persistence, or evading logging).\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the User Context**: Determine if the user running these scripts has elevated privileges or access to sensitive systems.\n- **Check for Additional Logs**: Correlate with other logs (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) to see if this activity is part of a larger attack.\n- **Analyze File Contents**: If the deleted files were not fully erased, inspect their contents for malicious code (e.g., embedded payloads, encoded commands).\n- **Monitor for Persistence**: Check for suspicious registry keys, scheduled tasks, or services that might be linked to these scripts.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile not definitive proof of malicious intent, the combination of **obfuscated paths, repetitive scripting, and file cleanup** strongly suggests this warrants **further investigation**. It could indicate a **malicious actor attempting to execute or persist scripts** on the system."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events to see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. \n\nIn the first few entries, there's PowerShell creating files with paths that have some strange parts, like \"..\\\\entrada_base\\\\\". The use of \"..\\\\\" might be trying to navigate directories, which could be part of path traversal attacks. Also, the files being created have names like \"componente_comum_script.bat\" and are being set with \"dir\" as their content. That seems odd because \"dir\" is a command to list directory contents. Maybe they're creating scripts that execute commands?\n\nThen there's a file created at \"C:\\\\componente_geral\\\\estrutura_comum\\\\objeto_comum_script.bat\". That's another script file. Also, some entries mention file deletions in the Temp directory, which might be cleanup after executing something. \n\nOther events include image loads like MpClient.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's a lot of activity with these, maybe something's trying to bypass them. However, the main concern here seems to be the creation of multiple batch files with PowerShell, possibly executing commands or setting up persistence.\n\nThe repeated use of Test-Path in the command lines checks if certain files exist, which could be part of checking if previous steps were successful. The combination of creating files, checking paths, and using PowerShell suggests some automated process, maybe malicious. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be legitimate scripts. But the pattern of creating multiple scripts in different directories, using potentially harmful commands, and the presence of both creation and deletion of temporary files could indicate an attack. \n\nI think the key points are the multiple PowerShell commands creating batch files with suspicious content, the path traversal, and the possible use of these scripts for executing commands. This behavior is often seen in malware or attack scripts. Therefore, this log data is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage**:\n   - **File Creation via PowerShell**: Multiple entries show PowerShell creating `.bat` files with commands like `dir` (directory listing). This could be part of a script injection or command execution attempt.\n     - Example:  \n       ```powershell\n       & {if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\n       ```\n       These commands check for file existence, potentially to confirm prior steps (e.g., payload delivery or persistence setup).\n\n   - **Path Traversal in File Paths**:  \n     Paths like `..\\\\entrada_base\\\\` suggest attempts to traverse directories, which could be part of evading detection or targeting specific system locations.\n\n2. **Script File Creation**:\n   - Files like `objeto_comum_script.bat` and `modulo_geral_script.bat` are created in non-standard locations (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\`), which may indicate **malicious persistence** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n3. **File Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - Deletion of temporary files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) suggests **cleanup after execution**, a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\n4. **Repeated Use of `Test-Path`**:\n   - This command is used to check if specific files exist, possibly to verify successful execution of prior steps (e.g., payload delivery, configuration checks).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malicious Script Execution**: The creation of `.bat` files with commands like `dir` could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., downloading additional payloads, establishing persistence).\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The repeated file creation and deletion may indicate attempts to **hide malicious activity** or **maintain access**.\n- **Lateral Movement**: The use of PowerShell and script files could be part of **lateral movement** within a network.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional PowerShell activity, network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to C2 servers), or registry changes.\n   - Investigate the contents of the created `.bat` files (if accessible).\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Examine the scripts (e.g., `objeto_comum_script.bat`) for hidden commands, encoded payloads, or references to external resources.\n\n3. **Check for Exploits**:\n   - Determine if the system was compromised via vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software, phishing).\n\n4. **Monitor for Persistence**:\n   - Look for signs of **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **service modifications** that could indicate long-term access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **patterned PowerShell activity**, **script creation**, and **file manipulation** that aligns with **malicious behavior**. This is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate investigation to determine if the system was compromised."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, but creating a file there might be normal. However, I should note that.\n\nNext, there are several ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. That's not unusual, but maybe if there's a pattern. Then, whoami.exe is executed a few times. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably benign.\n\nLooking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there are multiple instances where they're checking if certain executable files exist. For example, Test-Path checking for entrada_base.exe, tarefa_temporario.exe, etc. These paths seem arbitrary and not standard. The fact that they're checking for these files might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain components are present, which could be part of a setup or maybe even a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, there are ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate that the process is loading more modules than usual, which could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the deletion of a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. Deleting a script file might be part of cleanup, but if it's related to a policy test, that's probably normal. However, the name seems a bit generic and could be a sign of obfuscation.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe process running a command to check if a file exists in the temp directory. Again, similar to the PowerShell checks. This could be part of a script that's looking for specific files, which might be part of a legitimate process, but the repetition and the non-standard paths make me think it's worth investigating.\n\nThe fact that multiple PowerShell processes are accessing each other and loading different DLLs might indicate some form of persistence or data exfiltration. However, without more context like network activity or actual malicious payloads, it's hard to say for sure. But the combination of these checks and the use of temporary files could be indicative of something trying to avoid detection.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the repeated checks for specific files, the use of temporary files, and the multiple process accesses might be signs of a suspicious activity. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell, the pattern here is more frequent and involves non-standard paths, which could be a red flag. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several patterns that could indicate **potentially suspicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Access:** Multiple entries show PowerShell creating or accessing files in non-standard locations (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, temporary directories). While PowerShell profiles are normal, repeated file creation\/access in such contexts may suggest **custom scripts** or **payload persistence**.\n   - **File Existence Checks:** PowerShell commands like `Test-Path` repeatedly check for the existence of arbitrary files (e.g., `entrada_base.exe`, `tarefa_temporario.exe`). This could be part of **conditional execution logic** (e.g., checking for prerequisites), but the lack of clear purpose raises concerns about **obfuscation** or **malicious payload activation**.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - **`whoami.exe` Executions:** While benign on its own, the repeated use of `whoami.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell scripts might indicate **user enumeration** or **privilege checks** (e.g., determining if the process is running as an admin).\n   - **`cmd.exe` Usage:** A `cmd.exe` process runs a command to check for the existence of a file (`objeto_logico.txt`). This mirrors PowerShell's behavior, suggesting **cross-process coordination** or **scripting logic** that could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Multiple **`.NET` DLLs** (e.g., `clr.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are loaded by PowerShell. While normal for PowerShell, the **volume of such events** might indicate **unusual module loading** or **tampering** with legitimate processes.\n\n4. **Temporary File Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) is deleted. While cleanup is common, the filename suggests **script policy testing**, which could be a **red herring** or **obfuscation technique**.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The repeated checks for arbitrary files and the use of non-standard paths lack context, which is atypical for legitimate scripts.\n- **Repetition of Actions:** The same commands (e.g., `Test-Path`, `ProcessAccess`) are executed multiple times, which may indicate **automation** or **malicious persistence**.\n- **Cross-Process Coordination:** The interplay between PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` suggests **sophisticated scripting** that could be part of **payload delivery** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Network Activity:** Check for outbound connections or data transfers that might indicate **C2 communication** or **exfiltration**.\n- **Analyze File Contents:** Inspect the deleted temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) for obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Check User Context:** Determine if the processes are running under **elevated privileges** or **unusual user accounts**.\n- **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:** Investigate if the scripts are configured to **persist across reboots** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, file creation) are benign, the **combination of repetitive, non-standard behavior** and **lack of clear purpose** raises **red flags**. This batch **deserves further investigation** to rule out **malicious activity** such as **script-based attacks**, **persistence mechanisms**, or **data exfiltration**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process being run, which is a legitimate Windows utility that displays the current user's identity. However, the rest of the events are all related to 'powershell.exe' processes. \n\nLooking at the command lines for the PowerShell processes, they all seem to be running scripts that check if certain files exist. For example, the command line includes \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\...\\\\src\\\\...cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}\". This is a common technique used in PowerShell scripts to check for the presence of files. But why would this be suspicious?\n\nWell, the paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands are all in directories that look like they might be part of a custom application or project structure, such as 'C:\\\\pacote_ativo\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\...'. These aren't standard system directories, which could indicate that the user is trying to access files that are part of a non-standard setup. However, that alone isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, including loading of .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are normal for PowerShell, so that's not suspicious. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. This might be related to security software, but again, not necessarily malicious unless there's unexpected behavior.\n\nThen there are events related to file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1' is created and then deleted. This could be part of a script testing process, but the fact that it's in the Temp folder and is quickly deleted might be a red flag. However, PowerShell often uses the Temp directory for temporary files, so this isn't conclusive.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks are part of PowerShell's internal events, which are normal. But the repetition of these events with different paths might indicate that the system is being probed for the existence of various files, possibly as part of a larger script or automated process. \n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious part is the repeated checking of non-standard file paths. This could be part of a script that's looking for specific files, which might be part of a legitimate application, but it's also possible that this is part of a malicious script trying to locate files or check for the presence of certain components. However, without more context or evidence of malicious activity (like downloading files, executing unknown code, or modifying system settings), it's hard to confirm. \n\nThe presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be a normal part of the system's security checks, but if the user is running scripts that interact with these components, it could be a sign of something more complex. However, the events provided don't show any obvious signs of malware, such as network activity, unauthorized access, or modifications to critical system files.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events are not overtly malicious, the repeated checking of non-standard file paths and the use of temporary files might warrant further investigation. It's possible that the user is running a legitimate script, but the lack of clear purpose for these checks could be a sign of something more sinister. However, without additional information, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of these activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs include a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity, with the most notable aspects being:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`** is a standard Windows utility for checking user identity.\n   - **PowerShell script checks** using `Test-Path` are common in automation and configuration scripts.\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs** (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) being loaded are normal for system security operations.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - **Non-standard file paths** in `Test-Path` commands (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\...`) suggest probing for files in custom or non-system directories. This could indicate:\n     - A legitimate application checking for dependencies.\n     - A script attempting to locate or access files in a non-standard structure (potentially for malicious purposes, e.g., exfiltrating data or executing payloads).\n   - **Temporary file creation and deletion** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is common in PowerShell but may hint at:\n     - Script testing or execution in a sandboxed environment.\n     - Obfuscation tactics to avoid detection (e.g., creating and deleting temporary files to mask malicious activity).\n\n3. **Repetition and Scope:**\n   - Multiple `Test-Path` commands across different directories (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario\\...`, `C:\\tarefa_padrao\\...`) suggest a systematic attempt to check for the existence of files in various locations. This could be part of:\n     - **File enumeration** (e.g., a prelude to data exfiltration or lateral movement).\n     - **Script execution** that depends on specific file locations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **Lack of clear intent**: The scripts appear to check for files but do not execute actions (e.g., no file modifications, network traffic, or process spawning). This could be a **benign script**, but the lack of context raises concerns.\n- **Possible obfuscation**: The use of temporary files and repetitive checks might be designed to evade detection by security tools.\n- **Unusual file paths**: The custom directory structure (`pacote_ativo`, `estrutura_auxiliar`) is not standard and may indicate a **non-validated script** or a **custom application** with unclear legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the origin of the scripts**: Check if the user running the commands has legitimate access to the directories and files being probed.\n2. **Monitor for follow-up activity**: Look for additional events (e.g., file modifications, network connections, or process executions) that might indicate malicious intent.\n3. **Review PowerShell execution policies**: Ensure that scripts are not being executed under relaxed policies (e.g., `Bypass`) that could allow unauthorized code.\n4. **Check for anomalies in file paths**: Investigate whether the directories (e.g., `C:\\pacote_ativo\\...`) are part of a legitimate application or if they are newly created.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the activity is not overtly malicious, the **repetition of file checks in non-standard paths** and the **use of temporary files** warrant further investigation. These patterns could be part of a **benign script** or a **malicious reconnaissance phase**. Additional context (e.g., user intent, system state, or network behavior) would be necessary to determine the true nature of the activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. The command lines are all similar: checking if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in various paths. The paths are different each time, but the script name is the same. That's a red flag. Why are they checking for this specific script in so many different locations?\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for 'Process Create' and 'Process accessed' events. The 'whoami.exe' is running, which is normal, but the repeated PowerShell checks are unusual. The fact that they're testing the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a keystroke logging script, which is commonly used in malware to capture user input.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' event in the Temp directory. A temporary script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 is created. That could be part of an attempt to execute a script that's been bypassing execution policies, which is a common technique in PowerShell attacks.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs like clr.dll and mscorée.dll are normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, they might be part of a larger malicious process. However, without seeing the actual content of the created files or more anomalous behavior, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the repeated checks for the same script across different paths do suggest a possible malicious intent, maybe trying to find where the keystroke logger is stored.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of exploitation or data exfiltration here. The logs don't show any network activity or actual execution of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script. It's all about checking for the existence of the file. So, while suspicious, it might not be conclusive. But the repeated patterns and the specific script name are enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, though no definitive malicious behavior is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Script Checks**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) executing commands like:\n     ```\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\[path]\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** is a common name for **keystroke logging malware**, suggesting an attempt to locate or test the presence of such a script across various directories. This behavior is highly unusual and could indicate:\n     - A **malicious actor probing for existing payloads**.\n     - An **attempt to deploy or activate a keystroke logger**.\n\n2. **File Creation in Temp Directory**:\n   - A file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1` is created in `%TEMP%`, which may indicate:\n     - **Bypassing PowerShell execution policies** (e.g., using `Bypass` scope to run scripts).\n     - **Payload staging** for further malicious activity.\n\n3. **High-Frequency Process Access**:\n   - Repeated `Process accessed` events for `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggest **tooling or lateral movement** (e.g., enumerating privileges or testing access).\n\n4. **Unusual Process Names**:\n   - `Calculator.exe` (non-standard name for `calc.exe`) loading `urlmon.dll` could indicate **process injection** or **masquerading** (though this alone is not conclusive).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting**\n- The **repetitive probing for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** across multiple paths is a strong indicator of **malicious intent** (e.g., deploying a keystroke logger).\n- The **creation of a temporary script** in `%TEMP%` suggests **payload execution or persistence** mechanisms.\n- The **high volume of PowerShell activity** (even if benign) could signal **tooling for further exploitation** (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**\n1. **Check the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`** to confirm if it contains malicious code.\n2. **Audit file system changes** in the directories referenced by `Test-Path` commands.\n3. **Monitor network traffic** for exfiltration of keystroke data.\n4. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., registry changes, user activity) to identify the attacker's goals.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and should be investigated further. While no direct exploitation is confirmed, the **repeated probing for keystroke logging scripts** and **unusual PowerShell behavior** strongly suggest a potential **malicious actor probing the environment** for vulnerabilities or payloads."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe and chrome.exe have network connections detected. That's normal, right? svchost is a common system process, and chrome might be accessing the internet. But then there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the powershell events: there's ProcessAccess, Registry value set, Image loaded, Pipe Created, and Provider Lifecycle events. The command line shows commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are directory listing commands. But why so many times? Also, there's a file created in the Downloads folder named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' by powershell. Then there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. \n\nWait, winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the repeated powershell commands and the registry changes might be suspicious. The ImageLoad event points to mscorlib.ni.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. But that's a legitimate file. However, the frequency of the events and the multiple registry modifications could indicate something. \n\nAlso, the same command line is repeated multiple times. Could that be a sign of automated scripts or maybe a malicious activity trying to gather information? The fact that there are multiple registry value sets might be an attempt to modify system settings. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is often used by legitimate processes. However, the combination of multiple events, including file creation, registry changes, and repeated commands, might indicate a more thorough investigation is needed. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's no direct evidence of a threat, but the pattern of events is unusual. I'd lean towards INTERESTING because the combination of these activities could be indicative of a malicious actor performing reconnaissance or attempting to modify system behavior. However, I can't be 100% certain without more context. Maybe the confidence is around 0.7 or 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events show repeated command executions (directory recursion), registry modifications, and file creation in user directories, which may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts. The combination of these activities warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
