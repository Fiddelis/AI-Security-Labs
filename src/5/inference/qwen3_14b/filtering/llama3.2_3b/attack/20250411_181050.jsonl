The event shows that powershell.exe was accessed, and the winlog task is \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". The file is None.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is interesting. PowerShell is a common tool, but it's also often used in attacks. However, with just one event, there's not much to go on. The ProcessAccess rule might indicate that the process was accessed, but without more context like command-line arguments, user context, or other related events, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. \n\nThe file being None might mean that no file was involved, but that's not necessarily suspicious. Maybe it's just a process start. Since there's only one event and no additional information, it's not enough to classify as interesting. The confidence should be low because there's insufficient data. So, the classification is probably NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Single event showing process access for powershell.exe without additional context or suspicious indicators\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there's chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then powershell.exe with a process access event. Not too suspicious yet. Next, whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to get user info. But then there's cmd.exe with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Wait, certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding, but when combined with things like downloading executables, that's a red flag. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe command line: it's using certutil -encode on calc.exe and then decoding a temp file into another exe. That seems like it's trying to obfuscate or move files around. Also, there are multiple certutil processes creating files in the Temp directory. The File Executable Detected event for estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe might be a malicious file. \n\nThen there's rundll32.exe loading a DLL from PcaSvc.dll, which is part of the Windows Update system. But the command line includes PcaPatchSdbTask, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe that's a legitimate task, but sometimes attackers use rundll32 to execute malicious code. \n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll â€“ those are standard DLLs, but if they're being loaded from unexpected places or in unusual contexts, that could be bad. However, the paths here are system directories, so maybe that's normal. \n\nThere are multiple chrome.exe events with registry changes. Chrome often modifies the registry, but if there's a lot of changes, that might be concerning. However, the justification here is that the chrome events are just regular activity unless there's something else. \n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads, which is normal. But the combination of certutil commands and the decoded executable in Temp might indicate an attempt to execute a malicious file. Also, the presence of multiple certutil processes encoding and decoding files could be part of a data exfiltration or payload execution. \n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the certutil usage for encoding\/decoding, creating executable files in Temp, and possibly the rundll32 and SDXHelper activities. The fact that there are multiple events related to certutil and the creation of executable files in temporary directories is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Even though some processes like chrome and powershell are common, the combination here suggests something is happening that's not normal. \n\nSo, the classification should be INTERESTING. The confidence is high because of the certutil commands and the creation of executables in Temp. The justification is the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding and the presence of decoded executables, which are often seen in malware activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple certutil.exe processes encoding\/decoding files, creating executable files in temporary directories, and suspicious command-line arguments in cmd.exe suggest potential malicious activity, such as obfuscation or payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
