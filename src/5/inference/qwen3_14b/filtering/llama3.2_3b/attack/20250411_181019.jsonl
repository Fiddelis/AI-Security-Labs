{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first event is cmd.exe creating a service called win32times with a command line that includes starting a PowerShell script from a non-existent path: c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. Then there's another event where sc.exe is used to create the same service again, pointing to another non-existent script: c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Both scripts don't exist, which might be a red flag because attackers often try to execute non-existent files to evade detection.\n\nNext, there are multiple registry value set events involving services.exe and other processes. While registry changes can be normal, the repetition here might indicate something unusual. The sc.exe command to query the service (sc qc win32times) is also present, which could be part of checking if the service was created successfully.\n\nOther events involve processes like calc.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe loading DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. However, those are common system files, so unless there's a suspicious path or unexpected behavior, they might not be concerning. The PowerShell processes and process access events could be normal, but combined with the service creation attempts, they might suggest an attempt to persist or execute malicious code.\n\nThe key points here are the attempts to create services with non-existent scripts. Even though the files aren't found, the fact that the system is trying to execute them could indicate a potential security threat. The repetition of registry changes and the use of sc.exe to manipulate services are suspicious. However, without more evidence like actual malicious activity or successful execution, it's a bit ambiguous. But considering the combination of these events, it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple attempts to create a service (win32times) with non-existent PowerShell scripts, followed by registry modifications and process creation events. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or execute hidden payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
