{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and schtasks.exe. The first event shows cmd.exe running a command to create a scheduled task with schtasks, which is set to run daily under the system account. The command line includes a PowerShell script that's trying to execute a non-existent file: c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That seems odd because if the script doesn't exist, the task would fail, but maybe that's a red herring. However, creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (running as system) is a big flag. \n\nThen there's another entry where schtasks.exe is used again to create a task with a similar non-existent script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. The task name is \"win32times\" again. The fact that two different non-existent scripts are being referenced might be a sign that someone is trying to set up a task that's supposed to run a malicious script, but they're using dummy names. Maybe they're testing or trying to avoid detection by using non-existent files. \n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for svchost.exe with registry value changes. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but if there are multiple registry modifications, that could indicate something trying to alter system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there's the creation of files by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be normal during configuration. However, the other file created by powershell.exe is \"estrutura_geral.txt\" and \"entrada_ativo.txt\" â€“ not sure what those are, but they might be benign. However, the presence of file creation events might be part of the attack's setup.\n\nAnother thing is the use of \"-ep bypass\" in PowerShell. The -ep (ExecutionPolicy) bypass parameter is used to run scripts even if the execution policy is set to restrict that. That's a common technique in attacks to bypass security settings. So that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the scheduled task is set to run daily, which is unusual unless it's a legitimate task. The fact that the user is creating a task under the system account with a daily schedule suggests persistence, which is a common tactic in malware to maintain access.\n\nNow, looking at the other events: chrome.exe has multiple registry value set events. That's a lot, but maybe it's part of normal operation or a browser extension. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the other events seem more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that reference non-existent files, using -ep bypass, and running as system with daily recurrence. These are all signs of potential malicious activity. Even though the scripts don't exist, the act of creating the task is suspicious. The multiple registry changes by svchost might be related to other parts of the attack. However, the presence of legitimate processes like winlogbeat and chrome makes it a bit tricky. But the key indicators here are the scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, the use of bypass execution policy, and the non-existent script paths. These are strong signs that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Malicious Scheduled Task Creation**\n- **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`** are used to create scheduled tasks under the **`SYSTEM`** account with **daily recurrence**:\n  - **Command Example**:\n    ```bash\n    schtasks \/create \/tn \"win32times\" \/tr \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -f c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\" \/sc daily \/ru \"SYSTEM\"\n    ```\n  - **Red Flags**:\n    - **`-ep bypass`**: Bypasses PowerShell's execution policy, a common tactic to evade security controls.\n    - **Non-existent script path**: The referenced script (`c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1` and `c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) does not exist, suggesting **intentional obfuscation** or a failed attack attempt.\n    - **Running as SYSTEM**: High-privilege context, often used for **persistence** or **escalation**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Usage with Bypassed Execution Policy**\n- Multiple **`powershell.exe`** processes are logged with **`-ep bypass`**, indicating attempts to execute scripts despite restricted execution policies. This is a **common attack vector** for malware to execute payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual File Creation**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** and **`powershell.exe`** are involved in creating files like:\n  - `estrutura_geral.txt`, `entrada_ativo.txt`, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n  - While some files (e.g., `.yml.new`) may be legitimate during configuration, the **lack of context** and **repeated file creation** could indicate **data exfiltration** or **malicious payload storage**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Elevated Privilege Activity**\n- **`svchost.exe`** is associated with **multiple registry modifications**. While `svchost` is a legitimate system process, **frequent registry changes** under its context could indicate **tampering with system settings** or **installation of backdoors**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Redundant or Test-Related Activity**\n- The use of **non-existent script paths** (e.g., `NonExistingScript.ps1`) suggests **testing**, **debugging**, or **failed exploitation attempts**. This could indicate a **malicious actor probing the system** or **a misconfigured script**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch contains **multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs)**:\n- **Scheduled task creation with elevated privileges**.\n- **PowerShell execution with bypassed policies**.\n- **Unusual file creation**.\n- **Suspicious registry modifications**.\n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the **scheduled tasks**, **PowerShell execution logs**, and **file creation events** for further evidence of **malware persistence**, **data exfiltration**, or **privilege escalation**. Check if the non-existent scripts are part of a **malicious payload** or a **false flag**."}
