{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes running with various activities. The first event mentions a file created called 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's probably not too suspicious on its own, but then there's a lot of registry value set events from Chrome.exe. However, Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is normal for checking user context, but the command line is straightforward. The interesting part comes later with PowerShell.exe executing a script called 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' and saving the log to the Temp directory. That script name sounds malicious—it's often used in keylogging attacks. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. While these are legitimate system files, the repeated loading might indicate something's amiss. Also, the events include file creation and deletion in the Temp folder, which could be part of an attack to hide traces.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' events with PowerShell executing similar scripts from different paths might be an attempt to evade detection by varying the script locations. The fact that the same script is referenced multiple times across different directories suggests a pattern, which is suspicious. \n\nAdditionally, there's a file delete event for the temporary script, which is common in malware to remove evidence. The combination of these factors—multiple PowerShell activities, registry modifications by Chrome, execution of keystroke logging scripts, and file operations in Temp—points towards potential malicious behavior. \n\nHowever, I should check if any of these could be benign. For example, some PowerShell scripts might be part of legitimate software. But the repetition, the use of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', and the registry events from Chrome (which isn't typically involved in such activities) make me lean towards this being a security incident. \n\nSo, the classification here is likely 'INTERESTING' with high confidence due to the indicators of compromise like keystroke logging and suspicious process activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directories, indicating potential keylogging malware.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command line that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, and it's saving the keystrokes to a log in the TEMP directory. That sounds suspicious because capturing keystrokes is often associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. The path mentioned is C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The presence of such a script being run with the -LogPath parameter is a red flag.\n\nAnother event has a similar PowerShell command line again, this time with a different path: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. So, the same script is being executed from different directories, which might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the origin of the script. That's a common tactic in malware.\n\nThen there's an event where the process is None, and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', with a file path pointing to another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This suggests that the script might be part of a larger attack, possibly executed remotely. That's definitely something to look into because executing remote commands can be part of a compromise.\n\nOther events involve file creations, like the PowerShell script creating files in the user's Downloads directory. While that's not inherently malicious, when combined with the keylogging script, it could be part of a data exfiltration plan. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files might be normal if it's part of log monitoring, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, the repeated use of the same script name across different paths, along with the keylogging functionality, points towards a potential security threat. The justification would be the presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed multiple times, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like Defender's DLL being loaded), the combination with the keylogger script makes this batch interesting for investigation. I'd say the confidence is around 0.85 because while there are some benign events, the keylogger is a significant indicator.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath parameters, which is strongly indicative of keystroke logging (a common malicious activity).
