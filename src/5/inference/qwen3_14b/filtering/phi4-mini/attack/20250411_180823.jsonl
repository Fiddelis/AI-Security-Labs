{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll look for any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe has DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe and calc.exe. Wait, calc.exe is usually a harmless calculator, but when combined with other processes, it might be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses schtasks to create scheduled tasks named things like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines include running calc.exe. That seems odd because creating scheduled tasks with system-wide triggers and using calc.exe might be part of a malicious payload. \n\nThen, there are multiple entries of svchost.exe and schtasks.exe creating files in the System32\\\\Tasks directory. Creating tasks in that location could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the registry events might indicate changes to system settings. \n\nAnother point is the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with commands that create scheduled tasks. This is a common technique in malware to maintain access. The fact that multiple scheduled tasks are created with different names and triggers (onlogon, onstart) suggests an attempt to ensure the malicious code runs every time the user logs in or the system starts. \n\nThe Calculator.exe entries are also suspicious because they're being loaded from system paths, but that's normal. However, when combined with the scheduled tasks and the command-line arguments, it's a sign of something malicious. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of downloading files or connecting to external IPs, but the logs don't show that. However, the creation of scheduled tasks and the use of calc.exe as a payload are concerning. \n\nConfidence-wise, there are multiple indicators of suspicious behavior, but not definitive proof. It's a mix of normal processes and potential malicious activities. So, I'd say it's interesting but not certain. Maybe around 0.7 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with system-wide triggers (e.g., 'OnLogon', 'OnStartup'), use of calc.exe in command-line tasks, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and cmd.exe. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanisms or malicious payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at the entire batch together, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to chrome.exe performing various actions. There are several registry value set events, which might be normal if it's part of Chrome's operation. But then there's also a Pipe Created event, which could be suspicious if it's not typical for Chrome. However, I should check if there's anything more concerning.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but maybe the path or the name is unusual? The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during setup. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen, there are Image Loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files. Chrome loading them might be part of its normal operations, especially if it's interacting with the system's security features. But I should note that.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating a file called unidade_ativo.txt. That's a text file, so maybe just a normal user activity. However, there are also Process Accessed events for powershell.exe, which might indicate someone is trying to access or monitor the process. But again, PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks.\n\nThen, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard command to get user information. That's probably benign unless it's part of a larger malicious chain.\n\nPutting this all together, most of the events seem to be related to normal operations of Chrome, PowerShell, and other legitimate processes. The registry changes and file creations don't immediately point to malicious activity. However, the high number of registry value set events by chrome.exe might be worth investigating if they're modifying critical keys, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of winlogbeat and PowerShell activities could be part of normal system management. \n\nBut since the user is asking for classification, I need to decide if this is interesting. Since there's no clear indication of malicious behavior, like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or suspicious file paths, I might lean towards NOT INTERESTING. However, the high frequency of registry changes by chrome.exe could be a red flag. But considering that Chrome does interact with the registry for its own settings, it's possible that these are just normal operations. \n\nSo, I think the batch is not interesting because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events are mostly benign, even though some might be unusual, they don't form a pattern that's clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe) performing normal operations like registry modifications, file creation, and image loading. No clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
