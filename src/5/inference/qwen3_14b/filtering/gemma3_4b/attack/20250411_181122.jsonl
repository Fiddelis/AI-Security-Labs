First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool used to display the current user's identity. The command line looks normal, so that's probably just a regular system check. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there are several entries about 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a common tool, but the events here might be more telling. Let's check the command line in one of them. The command is using 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for 'password' in various file types. That's a classic sign of someone trying to find credentials in files. The command is repeated multiple times, which might indicate an attempt to search through files systematically. \n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading several .dll files from standard locations like System32 and Microsoft.NET. These are legitimate, so that's probably just normal operation. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so again, normal unless there's something else.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with the other events, it might be part of an attack. The script's name includes '__PSScriptPolicyTest' which sounds like a test, but the repeated command lines suggest it's more than just a test.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line. These might be related to the script running multiple times or being triggered by some event. The repetition could be a red flag, indicating automated scanning.\n\nThe presence of 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' with registry events doesn't seem suspicious on its own. However, if they were part of a larger pattern, but in this case, they're isolated.\n\nPutting it all together: the key points are the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords in files, the creation and deletion of a temporary script, and the multiple instances of the same command. These could indicate an attacker trying to find sensitive information on the system. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond the scanning, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the context, it's more likely to be a security test or a potential insider threat rather than a clear attack. Still, it's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of normal system activity and potential security-related events that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Scanning for Sensitive Data:**\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing a command to search for files containing the term \"password\" using `findstr` and `select-string`. This is a **common tactic used in credential harvesting** or reconnaissance during security assessments or attacks.\n   - The repetition of the same command across multiple logs (e.g., 6 instances of `Provider Lifecycle` events with identical command lines) suggests **systematic scanning** of files, which could indicate an attempt to locate sensitive information (e.g., credentials, configuration files).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`*.yml.new`) is created and deleted in the `Downloads` directory. While temporary files are normal, the combination with the above scanning activity raises suspicion of **ephemeral malicious activity** (e.g., a script being executed and then removed to avoid detection).\n\n3. **Legitimate System Activity:**\n   - `whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) are all legitimate tools. Their presence alone is not suspicious.\n   - Image load events for standard system DLLs (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are normal and unrelated to malicious behavior.\n\n4. **No Direct Evidence of Compromise:**\n   - There are no clear indicators of compromise (e.g., unauthorized access, malware execution, or network exfiltration). The logs focus on **file scanning and temporary script handling**, which could be part of a **security test** (e.g., red team exercise) or **legitimate troubleshooting**.\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activity is not definitively malicious but raises **red flags** due to the repetitive scanning for sensitive data and the use of temporary files. This behavior is often associated with **credential harvesting** or **data exfiltration** attempts.\n- **Context Matters:** If this activity occurs on a system where unauthorized access is suspected, further investigation (e.g., checking file contents, user context, and network traffic) is warranted. If it's part of a sanctioned security assessment, it may be benign.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Monitor User Context:** Verify if the user executing the PowerShell commands has legitimate authorization to perform such scans.\n- **Check File Contents:** Investigate the temporary script (`*.yml.new`) to determine its purpose (e.g., configuration file or malicious payload).\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections, unauthorized file modifications, or user behavior anomalies).\n- **Review Security Policies:** Ensure that such scanning activities are permitted and aligned with organizational security policies.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs suggest **potential reconnaissance activity** that could be part of a security test or an attack. While not conclusive, the combination of repeated file scanning, temporary script handling, and PowerShell usage warrants **further investigation** to rule out malicious intent."}

The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to look at all of them together and decide if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first one is about powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of the system's own processes. Then there's a command line in powershell using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That's a red flag because searching for passwords in documents could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. \n\nNext, there are several svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes might be suspicious if they're modifying important keys. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file, so that's probably okay.\n\nThe findstr.exe process is running with the command to search for passwords in various file types. That's definitely a suspicious activity. The user might be trying to find sensitive information. Then there are multiple powershell.exe instances accessing processes and creating files in user directories. Creating a file in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive could be an attempt to persist or modify startup scripts.\n\nThere's also a lot of chrome.exe events, mostly registry changes and DNS queries. Chrome is a common browser, so some of these might be normal, but excessive registry modifications could indicate some form of tampering. The winlogbeat.exe event is creating a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration change, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of powershell.exe searching for passwords, multiple registry changes by various processes, and the creation of files in user directories are all signs that might indicate malicious activity. However, some of these events could be benign. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of searching for passwords and multiple suspicious process activities makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell searching for passwords in files, unusual registry modifications by svchost and PowerShell, and potential persistence attempts via file creation in user directories.

First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nThe first event is about chrome.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, but sometimes attackers might use trusted directories to hide malicious files. However, the file is MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's normal. But I should note that.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit common, but if it's happening repeatedly, maybe there's some persistence mechanism. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same with the network connections; chrome.exe making multiple network connections could be normal if it's just browsing, but if it's connecting to suspicious IPs, that's a red flag. But the logs don't mention the destination, so I can't tell yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. That's normal user activity, but the filenames like \"objeto_logico.txt\" don't stand out. Another event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to check user context. Not suspicious on its own. The cmd.exe process running schtasks to delete tasks. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack, but again, without knowing the task names, it's hard to say. The task names mentioned like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" are generic and could be legitimate.\n\nThere's also a schtasks.exe process creating a task, but the command line shows deletion, which might be part of a normal cleanup. The svchost.exe modifying the registry is common for system processes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious point is the chrome.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender. However, since the file is a legitimate one, that might not be an issue. The rest of the events are either normal user activities or standard system processes. There's no clear indication of malware, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. The confidence is moderate because while some events are repetitive, they don't clearly point to malicious intent without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal user activity (e.g., chrome.exe network connections, file creation via powershell.exe) and legitimate system processes (e.g., svchost.exe, schtasks.exe).

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, so maybe not a problem. Then svchost.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with other events might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That's a bit odd because wmic is often used in attacks. Then, WMIC.exe is loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so if it's being loaded by WMIC, that might be a red flag. Also, there's a path to MpOAV.dll which is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. Loading these DLLs from a process that's typically not associated with them could indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is common, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of an attack. Also, there are commands like net user \/del trying to delete user accounts. That's definitely suspicious because deleting user accounts isn't normal behavior unless it's part of a cleanup, but in this context, it might be an attempt to remove evidence or take control.\n\nThe repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with registry modifications and process deletions, along with loading DLLs from Windows Defender, could indicate an attacker trying to manipulate system processes and evade detection. The combination of these events, especially the deletion of user accounts and the unusual DLL loading, suggests potential malicious activity. However, some of these events could be normal if, for example, a legitimate script is running. But the presence of multiple suspicious actions across different processes and the use of tools like wmic and WMIC makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC.exe loading Defender-related DLLs (MpOAV.dll, amsi.dll), deletion of user accounts via 'net user \/del', and process manipulation (wmic process delete).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events.

Also, there's a command to delete a service with \"sc delete win32times\". That seems suspicious because deleting user accounts and services could be part of a larger attack, like trying to remove evidence or take control of the system.\n\nThere are multiple instances of Process Create events for these commands, and some Registry value changes. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe might indicate someone is trying to execute commands remotely or perform administrative tasks without proper authorization. The fact that they're modifying user accounts and services could be a red flag. Also, the presence of \"conhost.exe\" and \"whoami.exe\" might be normal, but when combined with the other activities, it could point to a more complex attack.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: there's a cmd.exe process that's running a command to delete temporary files. The command line looks like it's trying to delete files in the Temp directory. That's a bit odd because normally, temporary files might be deleted, but the way it's structured with the 'del' command and the use of '%%temp%%' could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers use similar commands to remove evidence.\n\nNext, there are several entries for powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The fact that there are multiple registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the File Delete logged event, there's a deletion of a file named 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe' in the Temp directory. Deleting files in Temp isn't always bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be an attempt to remove malicious payloads after execution.\n\nThen there are several entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but the repetition could be noteworthy. Also, the ImageLoad events show that PowerShell is loading various DLLs, including those related to .NET and Windows Defender. While some of these are normal, the presence of MpOAV.dll (Windows Defender's component) might be a sign that the system is scanning for threats, but it's also possible that the malware is trying to bypass these.\n\nAnother point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a file named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1'. This could be part of a script that's being tested or executed, and then deleted to avoid leaving traces. The fact that it's in the Temp directory again might be a common tactic for attackers to execute scripts temporarily.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is usually used to get the current user's identity. While this is a legitimate command, if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several indicators that could be part of a malicious activity: deletion of temporary files, multiple registry changes, PowerShell being used extensively, and the creation and deletion of script files. However, some of these actions could be legitimate, like system maintenance or script execution. The confidence level is a bit tricky here. Since there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, but not a clear-cut attack, I'd say it's moderately suspicious. It's worth investigating further to determine if these events are part of a larger attack or just normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **moderately suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**:\n1. **Command-Line Deletion of Temporary Files**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to delete files in the `%temp%` directory (e.g., `tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe`). While temporary file cleanup is normal, the use of `del` with `%temp%` could indicate **evidence removal** or **malicious payload cleanup**.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Frequent registry modifications** (`RegistryEvent`) and **file creation\/deletion** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) suggest **script execution** and **cleanup**. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration).\n   - **File creation\/deletion** in `%temp%` (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*`) is a classic tactic for **ephemeral malware** to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Image Load Events**:\n   - PowerShell loaded several system DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). While normal, the presence of **Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll** (antivirus component) could indicate **antivirus evasion** or **analysis of defender behavior**.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**:\n   - A `PipeEvent` was logged, which could be used for **inter-process communication** (legitimate) or **malicious coordination** between processes.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe Execution**:\n   - The `whoami.exe` process (used to check user identity) is often used in **reconnaissance** during attacks. While benign alone, it may be part of a broader malicious chain.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - PowerShell and `cmd.exe` are widely used for system administration.\n  - Temporary file cleanup is common during software execution.\n  - Windows Defender components are part of normal system behavior.\n\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - **File creation\/deletion in `%temp%`** without clear purpose.\n  - **Multiple registry modifications** without explicit user context.\n  - **Unusual PowerShell script names** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*`) may indicate **script obfuscation** or **policy testing**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **unauthorized user activity**, **unusual network traffic**, or **process injections** around the timestamps of these events.\n   - Investigate the **source of the PowerShell scripts** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*`) and whether they were downloaded from untrusted locations.\n\n2. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Look for **registry keys** or **scheduled tasks** that could be used to reinfect the system after cleanup.\n\n3. **Monitor Defender Logs**:\n   - Investigate why `MpOAV.dll` was loaded—was it part of a **real-time scan** or **malware evasion**?\n\n4. **Behavioral Analysis**:\n   - Use **sandboxing** or **endpoint detection tools** to analyze the deleted files (if recoverable) for malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the combination of **ephemeral file operations**, **PowerShell usage**, and **registry changes** raises **moderate concern**. Further investigation is required to determine if this is **legitimate activity** or **part of a stealthy attack**. **Confidence level: 60% (moderately suspicious)**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common in some attacks, but not always malicious. Then there's some file creation events. One entry mentions a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Hmm, StartupProfileData might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. That could be a red flag if it's being modified without user knowledge.\n\nAnother file created is related to winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal if someone is setting up monitoring, but maybe not if it's part of an attack. However, there's also a mention of 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign. But combined with the PowerShell activity, maybe it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process access. The 'Registry value set' events could indicate changes to system settings, which might be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The 'Process accessed' events might be normal monitoring, but if they're frequent, that could be suspicious.\n\nBut wait, the majority of the events seem to be normal system operations. For example, svchost.exe and calc.exe are legitimate processes. The image loaded for urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, which is normal. The winlogbeat file creation could be part of a legitimate monitoring setup, though maybe the user is installing it in a suspicious location.\n\nThe key points here are the PowerShell activity and the StartupProfileData file. If that file is being created or modified, it might be used to execute malicious code. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here—like downloading files from the internet, unusual network activity, or execution of suspicious scripts. The logs don't show any clear signs of exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, considering all that, the logs have some suspicious elements but not enough to confirm malicious behavior. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the PowerShell and file creation events, but the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. However, since there's no clear indication of an attack, maybe it's on the lower side. Alternatively, if the StartupProfileData is being used for persistence, that's a concern. But without more data, it's hard to be certain. I think the justification would be that there are multiple PowerShell events and file creations that could indicate an attempt to set up persistent access, but without further evidence, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing, which is common in both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities (e.g., script-based attacks).\n   - A file created at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` suggests potential modification of PowerShell profiles, which could be used for persistence or automated script execution.\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   - A file related to **Winlogbeat** (a log shipper) is created in the `Downloads` directory. While this could indicate legitimate monitoring setup, its presence in a user’s Downloads folder may raise questions about intent or context.\n   - The `MpClient.dll` file (part of Windows Defender) is loaded, which is a legitimate process but could be exploited in some attack scenarios.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events (e.g., by `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`) may indicate attempts to modify system settings or establish persistence.\n   - `Process accessed` events (e.g., for `calc.exe`, `notepad.exe`) are likely benign but could be part of a broader pattern of process manipulation.\n\n4. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - Normal system processes like `svchost.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `urlmon.dll` are present, which are not inherently suspicious.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- The combination of **PowerShell activity** and **file creation in user directories** (e.g., StartupProfileData) could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute scripts without user consent.\n- The presence of **Winlogbeat** in a non-standard location might suggest an unusual setup, though it could also be a false positive.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **indicators that warrant further investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell usage, file modifications, and registry changes. However, **no definitive evidence of malicious activity** (e.g., data exfiltration, exploit payloads) is present. The logs could represent either benign system behavior or early-stage reconnaissance.\n\n### **Classification:**\n- **Class:** `INTERESTING`  \n- **Confidence:** `0.6` (moderate)  \n- **Justification:** The logs contain patterns (PowerShell, file creation, registry changes) that could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute scripts, but no clear evidence of malicious intent is present. Further analysis (e.g., network traffic, file content) is required for confirmation."}

Chrome.exe has several Dns queries and Network connections.\n\nHmm, so the main processes here are chrome, powershell, and some standard utilities. The whoami.exe is normal, but maybe the repeated powershell accesses could be suspicious. However, powershell is a common tool, so that's not necessarily bad. The registry changes for ApplicationFrameHost and Calculator might be benign too, as those are standard processes. Chrome's DNS queries and network connections are normal for a browser.\n\nWait, but are there any signs of malicious activity?
