{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of 'schtasks.exe' being used to create scheduled tasks. Specifically, there's a command line that includes running a PowerShell script with '-ep bypass' which is often used to bypass execution policies. The script paths mentioned, like 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1', don't exist, which might be a red flag because the attacker is trying to execute non-existent scripts. \n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' being used to create these tasks with the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task under the system account without proper justification is unusual. Also, the fact that 'schtasks' is being used multiple times, and the task is named 'win32times' which might be a misleading name to hide malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are events where 'powershell.exe' is accessing files and creating files in user directories. However, some of these files like '.winlogbeat.yml.new' and 'estrutura_geral.txt' might be related to legitimate software (like Winlogbeat), but the combination with the scheduled tasks and the non-existent scripts raises concerns. \n\nThere are also multiple 'Registry value set' events from processes like 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe', which could indicate attempts to modify registry settings for persistence or to disable security features. However, the majority of the events seem to be from normal processes like Chrome and svchost, which might be part of regular operations. \n\nBut the key points here are the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist, the use of high-privilege accounts, and the bypassing of execution policies. These are classic indicators of malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination of these suspicious actions makes this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because the indicators are strong, but not 100% certain without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies (-ep bypass) and referencing non-existent scripts. 2) PowerShell and cmd.exe used for potentially malicious operations. 3) Unusual registry modifications by system processes. 4) File creation in user directories that may indicate data exfiltration or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
