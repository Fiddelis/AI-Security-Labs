So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see several entries related to powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but its usage can be malicious if it's executing unexpected commands.\n\nLooking at the command_line for one of the powershell.exe processes: it's starting a process with a long path like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" suggests path traversal, which might be a way to access files in parent directories. That could be a sign of something trying to access files it shouldn't, or maybe obfuscating the path. Also, the script names are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or could indicate the attacker is targeting a specific region, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a sign that the process is interacting with antivirus software, which could be an attempt to disable or bypass it. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a file quickly might be part of a script's normal operation, but if it's writing to a temp directory and then deleting it, that could be a way to hide malicious activity. However, again, this isn't conclusive on its own.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple instances of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events. These might be related to the PowerShell provider, which is used for navigating the file system and registry. If the provider is being used in an unusual way, that could be a problem. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe event is related to the registry, but that's a normal Windows process, so probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the PowerShell commands with path traversal and the use of temporary scripts. However, these could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the environment. Since the logs don't provide context on what's normal, but the presence of multiple PowerShell commands with potentially obfuscated paths and temporary script creation could be indicative of a script-based attack or reconnaissance. Therefore, it's worth investigating further to confirm if these activities are malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious on their own. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **PowerShell Script Execution with Path Traversal**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes execute commands like:\n     ```\n     Start-Process \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\"\n     ```\n   - The use of `..\\` (path traversal) suggests **potential obfuscation or attempts to access files in parent directories**, which could be used to bypass security restrictions or access sensitive files.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file is created and immediately deleted:\n     ```\n     FileCreate: C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\n     FileDelete: Same file\n     ```\n   - This pattern is **common in malicious scripts** to avoid leaving evidence, though it can also occur in legitimate scenarios (e.g., temporary testing).\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Provider Lifecycle Events**:\n   - Repeated `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events with commands like:\n     ```\n     Start-Process \"C:\\estrutura_base\\objeto_principal\\..\\<script>.bat\"\n     ```\n   - These could indicate **exploitation of PowerShell's provider model** to interact with the file system or registry in non-standard ways.\n\n4. **Loading of Windows Defender DLL**:\n   - The process loads `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus component). While normal, this could signal **attempts to interact with or bypass antivirus protections**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**:\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - PowerShell is a common administrative tool, and temporary scripts are used in many environments.\n  - The use of non-English file paths (e.g., Portuguese) may reflect **targeted attacks** or simply the use of localized software.\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - **Lack of clear purpose**: The scripts executed (e.g., `modulo_logico_script.bat`) have vague names, which could be obfuscation.\n  - **No user interaction**: The commands are executed without visible user input, suggesting **automation or potential exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **unusual user activity**, such as login times, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.\n   - Investigate if the scripts referenced (e.g., `modulo_logico_script.bat`) exist on the system and their contents.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Commands**:\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell Transcript Logging** or **Event Viewer** to inspect the exact commands executed.\n   - Look for **in-memory execution** or use of `Invoke-Expression`\/`IEX`, which are common in malware.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Signatures**:\n   - Scan the system for **malware** using antivirus tools, especially focusing on the temporary script files and referenced `.bat` files.\n\n4. **Review User Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that the user executing these commands has **appropriate privileges**. If not, this could indicate **privilege escalation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **combination of PowerShell path traversal, temporary script creation, and lack of clear purpose** raises concerns. This warrants **further investigation** to determine if these events are part of a legitimate process or a potential security incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Calculator.exe and powershell.exe are involved in registry value sets. That's normal, but maybe not too suspicious. Then, there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. Hmm, but then there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate. \n\nWait, but then there's a command line for powershell.exe that's executing a script from a path like \"C:\\estrutura_logico\\registro_temporario\\..\\\". The use of \"..\\\" might be a red flag, indicating possible directory traversal or trying to access parent directories. That could be a sign of malicious activity, like trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process running a script from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". Again, the path names are a bit generic and might not be standard. Also, there's a file created event for powershell.exe in the Downloads folder, which could be normal, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated registry value set events for chrome.exe. While Chrome is a common application, multiple registry changes could indicate tampering or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are part of Windows Defender and Anti-Virus components, which are legitimate. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem. \n\nThe presence of multiple process accesses and image loads might indicate that the system is being manipulated, especially if these events are coming from processes that are not typically involved in such activities. The command line arguments in the powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes show script executions from non-standard paths, which could be a sign of malicious scripts being run.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several events that could be indicators of compromise. The suspicious paths, multiple registry changes, and execution of scripts from unusual locations all contribute to a pattern that might be worth investigating. However, some events are normal, like the Defender DLLs being loaded. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are benign, but the combination of these factors makes me think it's interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: PowerShell and CMD executing scripts from non-standard paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\'), repeated registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell (potentially indicating tampering), and file creation in user directories. These patterns may suggest malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first seven entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. The winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and the file is None. Now, chrome.exe doing registry modifications isn't necessarily bad, but multiple instances of the same process doing the same action repeatedly might be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's any context here. Since the file is None, maybe it's just normal operations, but repeated registry changes could be part of a persistence mechanism or something else.\n\nThen, the eighth entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. The path is in the Downloads directory, which is common for software installations. The file name is .winlogbeat.yml.new. That might be part of a configuration file being written, which is normal during setup. But I should note that winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be a legitimate activity.\n\nThe ninth entry is powershell.exe creating a file called elemento_base.txt in the same Downloads folder. PowerShell creating files isn't inherently malicious, but depending on the context, it could be. However, without more information, like the content of the file or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch, the majority of events are from chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. While that could be part of normal operations, such as updating settings or extensions, the repetition might be suspicious. However, without seeing any other indicators like unusual registry keys, unexpected network activity, or other processes involved, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nThe other two events are from legitimate processes creating files in the Downloads directory, which is a common place for user activities. Unless there's a pattern of creating executable files or files with suspicious names, these might be benign.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch has a few events that could be normal, but the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might warrant further investigation. However, since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond the repeated registry events, and the other events are from legitimate processes, the confidence level might be moderate. The classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated registry modifications, but not high enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated 'Registry value set' operations may indicate potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. While some registry modifications are normal, the repetitive nature and lack of associated file activity warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
