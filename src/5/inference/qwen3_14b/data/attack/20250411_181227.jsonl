{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell commands. Each command line seems to be creating a scheduled task using PowerShell. The command lines are similar, with parts like New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, and Register-ScheduledTask. The tasks are named things like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. All of them are using calc.exe as the action, which is a bit suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows calculator, but when used in scheduled tasks, especially with administrative privileges, it might be a red flag.\n\nThe triggers are set to \"AtLogon,\" meaning the task runs when a user logs in. The principal is set to \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" with RunLevel Highest, which means the task runs with the highest privileges. That's a significant security risk because if an attacker can create a scheduled task with admin rights, they can execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries for PowerShell processes with different event tasks like \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed.\" But the key part here is the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges. The fact that there are several similar events suggests that this isn't a one-off occurrence but possibly part of a broader attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nEven though calc.exe is a legitimate application, the context here is concerning. Scheduled tasks with high privileges can be used to execute malicious payloads. The use of PowerShell to create these tasks is common in attack chains for persistence and privilege escalation.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe and image loads, but those don't seem as critical compared to the scheduled task creations. The confidence here is high because the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, using calc.exe as the payload.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell.exe is loading image files. The paths mentioned are things like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll. These are all .NET Framework and Windows Defender related DLLs. Loading these might be normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious here. However, since they're system files, maybe it's just regular operations.\n\nThen, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file could be part of a test, but maybe it's something malicious. However, the fact that it's deleted might be an attempt to cover tracks, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a common test program, but the trigger is at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with highest privileges. This seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to execute code with elevated rights. The name of the task is \"estrutura_auxiliar$object\" which might be a random name to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. If this is normal, maybe Chrome is just updating its settings. But multiple registry changes could be a sign of something else, though without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are also entries where the process is \"None\" and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". However, since the process is None, maybe these are placeholders or errors in the log. But if they're actual events, executing remote commands without a process might indicate something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited.\n\nPutting this all together: The PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation, are concerning. Creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be part of a privilege escalation. The other events might be normal, but the combination of PowerShell doing that plus the remote command executions might indicate a potential security incident. However, some of the events could be benign. The confidence isn't 100% because without more context, but the presence of the scheduled task with high privileges and the remote command executions makes me lean towards \"interesting\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve loading system DLLs (e.g., clr.dll, MpOAV.dll) and creating\/deleting temporary scripts, which may indicate benign testing or potential malicious activity.

Additionally, numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process may indicate suspicious remote activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start breaking it down.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of entries with the process 'chrome.exe' and the winlog task 'Registry value set'. There are eight of those. Then there's one entry with 'chrome.exe' and a 'Dns query' task. After that, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory, and a 'powershell.exe' creating another file called 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think about what's normal here. Chrome modifying the registry... Well, Chrome does some registry operations for its own settings, but multiple entries might be a red flag. However, eight times seems a lot. But wait, maybe it's just a lot of normal operations. But then again, if it's all the same process and same task, that might be suspicious. But I need to check if that's typical.\n\nThen there's the Dns query from chrome.exe. That's normal for browsing, but maybe if it's querying unusual domains, but the log doesn't mention the domain. So not sure there.\n\nThe other two entries: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's normal if it's part of its setup. But the path is in the user's Downloads, which might be okay. The other file is created by powershell.exe with the name 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. That translates to 'auxiliary object' in Portuguese. Not sure if that's significant, but creating a file via PowerShell isn't inherently bad. However, if there's no other context, maybe it's just a normal file creation.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The majority of events are from chrome.exe modifying the registry. If that's a normal behavior, then maybe not interesting. But if it's an unusual number of registry changes, that could be a sign of something. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. The other events don't seem too suspicious on their own.\n\nBut wait, the user said to consider the combination of all events. So maybe the fact that there are so many registry changes from chrome.exe, plus the other file creations. But I don't see a clear pattern of malicious activity here. Unless the registry changes are part of a configuration change that's not typical. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nSo, maybe the classification here is 'NOT INTERESTING' because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The chrome.exe registry changes could be normal, and the other file creations are benign. Unless there's something else I'm missing. But with the given data, I don't see enough to flag it as interesting. The confidence might be around 0.4, since there's some unusual activity but not enough to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal Chrome registry operations and benign file creations by legitimate processes. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple entries where the process is None, and the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's a red flag. But since they're all the same, maybe it's a false positive or a misconfigured system. But repeating the same event multiple times might indicate something automated.\n\nThen there's an entry with a process that's a PowerShell command. The command line shows creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. That seems suspicious. Creating a scheduled task that runs as admin could be part of a privilege escalation attempt. The name 'unidade_comum' might be a placeholder or something the attacker used. This looks like a potential malicious activity.\n\nNext, there's a process 'WmiPrvSE.exe' which is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service. It's loading 'taskschd.dll' from the System32 directory. That's normal, but if it's part of a chain of events, maybe it's being used for something else. But not sure yet.\n\nThen several 'svchost.exe' processes with registry value set events. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so registry changes here could be normal or could indicate something malicious. However, multiple registry changes might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother entry shows 'svchost.exe' creating a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum'. That's the same name as the scheduled task from the PowerShell command. So that's a connection. Creating a task in the System32 Tasks directory is a common place for scheduled tasks, but if it's being done by an unauthorized process, that's a problem.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for benign scripts, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is the Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV is part of Windows Defender. Loading these might be normal, but if it's part of bypassing detection, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just part of normal operations, but the file name is a .yml.new, which might be a configuration file being written. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, the creation of a task in the System32 Tasks directory, and multiple registry changes. These could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or install a backdoor. However, some of these events might be normal. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with admin rights, using PowerShell in a way that's not typical, and the presence of multiple registry changes raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign, but the overall pattern is concerning. So I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, and file creation in System32\\\\Tasks directory suggest potential privilege escalation or malicious task scheduling.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
