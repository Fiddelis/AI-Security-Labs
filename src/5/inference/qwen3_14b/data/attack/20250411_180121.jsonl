That's common, maybe a normal user activity. But then there's an entry about MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe just monitoring.\n\nThen winlogbeat.exe is creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of legitimate setup. But then there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. That could be normal, but repeated access might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\" with the \/F flag, which forces deletion without confirmation. That's suspicious because deleting a task named \"spawn\" might be related to malware that uses scheduled tasks to persist. Also, the command is redirected to null, which could be hiding output to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used to delete the task, and another entry where it loads taskschd.dll.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the processes and their command lines. There are several entries with PowerShell commands that use WebClient to download files from GitHub. The URLs all point to raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. However, the filenames being downloaded are placed in the TEMP directory, which is a red flag. Typically, legitimate software might download files, but doing so into TEMP and using PowerShell with WebClient could be part of a malicious script, especially if the files are not expected.\n\nLooking at the file creation events, there's one where a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. But the rest of the file events are either about PowerShell or Chrome. Also, there are multiple registry events related to Chrome, but Chrome is a common browser, so maybe that's normal unless there's something unusual in the registry changes. However, the user hasn't provided the specific registry keys, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of the same PowerShell command structure. All the download commands use the same method: New-Object System.Net.WebClient and DownloadFile. This might be part of a pattern used by malware to download payloads. The fact that multiple such events are present increases the likelihood of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the task names in winlog include 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and others. While these are legitimate task names, when combined with the PowerShell commands, it could indicate something malicious. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity. For example, the 'Dns query' event is there, but without more info on the domain, it's hard to say.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the use of the TEMP directory for downloaded files is concerning. Legitimate software might do this, but in conjunction with multiple similar events, it's more likely to be a sign of malicious behavior. Also, the filenames downloaded are all LICENSE.txt from different repositories, which might be a way to obfuscate the actual malicious payload.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these could be false positives. For example, developers might use PowerShell scripts to download files for testing. But given the number of similar events and the use of TEMP, it's more indicative of a potential security threat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has multiple PowerShell commands downloading files into temporary directories, which is suspicious. The repetition and the lack of obvious legitimate purpose make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is high, but not certain, so maybe around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing WebClient-based downloads from GitHub to temporary directories, which is a common pattern in malicious activity.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe is doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe involved. The first powerhell event is a registry value set, which might be okay, but then there's a process create event with a command line that downloads a file from GitHub. Wait, the command line shows DownloadFile with URLs from GitHub. Now, GitHub can be a legitimate source, but sometimes attackers use it to host malicious payloads. However, the files being downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are usually benign. But the fact that PowerShell is being used to download these files might be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple image loads related to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to hide malicious activity. However, the file names here are .ps1 scripts, which are PowerShell scripts. The fact that it's created and then deleted might indicate that the script was executed and then cleaned up, which is common in some attacks.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the repeated downloads could be part of a larger attack, especially if the scripts are being executed in memory or used for further malicious activities. However, the justification here is that the files are LICENSE.txt, which are typically not malicious. But the use of PowerShell to download these files and the subsequent file creation and deletion might still be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is that the user is using the \"Provider Lifecycle\" task, which might be related to some event logging, but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, downloading files, and temporary file operations could be indicative of something more than just normal user activity. But without more context, like the content of the downloaded files or other suspicious activities, it's a bit tricky.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of multiple PowerShell events, downloading files from GitHub, and temporary file operations might be worth investigating. However, since the files are LICENSE.txt and the other activities are related to legitimate system processes, the confidence might be moderate.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by scanning through each entry.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe. There's also some reg.exe commands. The tasks mentioned include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Registry object added or deleted. The command lines show some registry deletion attempts, like REG DELETE on HKCU\\SOFTWARE... Run keys. That's a red flag because modifying registry run keys can be part of persistence mechanisms, like adding startup entries.\n\nLooking at the processes: conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe. Conhost is usually a legitimate process, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be involved. The repeated use of PowerShell and the registry modifications could indicate someone trying to alter system settings or install malware.\n\nAlso, there's an entry where the command line is \"powershell.exe & {}\" with the Provider Lifecycle task. That might be a placeholder or a test command, but repeated multiple times could be part of a script or automated process. However, I need to check if there's any actual malicious payload here. The last entry mentions mscoree.dll being loaded, which is a legitimate file for .NET, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the majority of the events are registry modifications and process accesses. The user is using PowerShell and cmd.exe to delete registry keys and possibly modify them. That could be part of a cleanup or evasion technique. For example, deleting registry keys that might have been used for persistence or to hide other activities.\n\nBut why is this interesting? Well, the combination of registry changes, especially in the Run keys, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe could indicate an attacker trying to maintain persistence or alter system behavior. The fact that multiple registry events are logged, along with process creations, might suggest an attempt to modify the system's startup processes or hide their presence.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be normal. For example, whoami.exe is a standard tool for checking user context. But when paired with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack chain. The repeated PowerShell commands with empty scripts might be a way to test or probe the system without triggering alerts, but that's a bit speculative.\n\nI should also consider the confidence. The presence of registry deletions and modifications, along with multiple process accesses, points towards potential malicious activity. The confidence level might be around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination and frequency suggest something worth investigating. However, I need to make sure there's no legitimate explanation for these events. For example, a system update or a legitimate script that modifies registry keys.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete, Pipe Created, etc. There are several instances where PowerShell is loading .dll files from the Windows .NET Framework and Windows Defender directories. That's normal, right? Those are legitimate system files. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file in Temp might be suspicious. Why would PowerShell create a script and then delete it immediately? That could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, there's a Pipe Created event, which might indicate some inter-process communication. Not sure if that's malicious, but combined with the other events, it's worth noting. Then there are some Registry value set events from PowerShell and other processes like conhost.exe and cmd.exe. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. \n\nHowever, I also see a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. The winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a log collection tool. But the fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple file operations, including creating and deleting scripts, might be more indicative of something. \n\nWait, the file created in Temp is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like it could be related to PowerShell execution policy testing. But if it's created and then immediately deleted, that might be a red flag. Also, multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate that PowerShell is being accessed by other processes, which could be a sign of compromise. \n\nHowever, I need to consider that some of these events are normal. For example, loading .NET assemblies is common. But the combination of creating a script file, deleting it, and the Pipe events might be more suspicious. The confidence here isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the unusual file operations and registry changes might warrant further investigation.

That's a classic technique to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be executing something. Also, the command line for some PowerShell processes is \"& {}\", which is a no-op, but maybe that's part of obfuscation.\n\nLooking at the process tree, multiple PowerShell instances are being created and accessed. The fact that there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET components might be normal, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it could be a sign of something malicious. Also, the Registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, some of the events are just normal operations. For example, the whoami.exe is a legitimate tool. But the high frequency of PowerShell and the suspicious file operations might indicate a potential security incident. The presence of the Windows Defender DLL being loaded could be a red herring, but it's also possible that the attacker is trying to bypass detection.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the combination of PowerShell usage, Registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and multiple ImageLoads might be indicative of malicious activity.

Some of them are from legitimate paths like Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and clr.dll. Those are common and usually not a problem. But then there's the File created and deleted events in the Temp directory. The file created is a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Then it's immediately deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_\", which sounds like a test, but maybe it's a cover.\n\nThen there are several Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields. They're deleting various .zip files in the Temp directory. The fact that there are so many deletions could indicate that the system is trying to clean up after some activity, maybe after extracting files from those zips. But why so many? Also, the use of ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to avoid errors if the files aren't there, which might be part of a larger process.\n\nThe Chrome events are loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The MpOAV.dll is also from Defender. Those might be legitimate, but sometimes attackers can inject malicious code into legitimate processes. However, there's no indication here of that. The registry events from Chrome don't seem suspicious either.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell activity involves creating and deleting files in Temp, which is common in benign scenarios like script execution. However, the combination of multiple deletions, the presence of a .ps1 file, and the use of Remove-Item with ErrorAction could be part of a larger malicious process. But on the other hand, the other events are normal. The confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Pipe Created, Process accessed, and Image loaded. The files mentioned are mostly from system directories like Windows Defender and System32. \n\nHmm, I notice that one entry has a file path pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so maybe that's normal. Another entry has a file created in the user's AppData directory, which could be suspicious if it's unexpected. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line that says \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\". That seems like someone is trying to delete a file named objeto_principal.zip. If this is part of a larger attack, maybe they're cleaning up after themselves. But on its own, deleting a file might not be malicious unless it's part of a sequence of events.\n\nThere's also a process created with \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item...}\" which is a PowerShell command. That's a common technique in attacks to execute commands. However, the presence of multiple Registry value sets and Process accessed events might be part of normal operations, but combined with the deletion command, it could be a red flag.\n\nThe user is running whoami.exe, which is a standard tool to check the current user, but again, that's not inherently malicious. The repetition of Registry events and Process accesses might indicate some kind of persistence mechanism or lateral movement.\n\nWait, but there's also a lot of chrome.exe entries. Chrome is a common browser, and some of these events might be related to extensions or normal browsing. However, the high number of Registry value sets from chrome.exe could be unusual. Maybe it's being used to modify settings or inject code.\n\nThe presence of Image loaded events for mscoree.dll, which is part of the .NET runtime, is normal. But if there's any unexpected loading, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't show any anomalies there.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the PowerShell commands, the deletion of a file, and the multiple Registry modifications. While some of these events are normal, the combination might suggest an attempt to execute malicious code or clean up traces.

The commands use Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That's a bit suspicious because typically, deleting files in TEMP might not be harmful, but doing it multiple times with such parameters could be an attempt to clean up after some activity, maybe to hide evidence. But I need to check if there's more.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal if it's part of setup. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell loading a DLL from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe if it's unexpected, but the path looks like a standard Defender location. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a file created in the user's AppData directory for PowerShell's StartupProfileData. That's part of PowerShell's normal operation, I think. So that's probably okay.\n\nThere are several registry events, mostly from Chrome and RuntimeBroker. Chrome updating registry values could be normal, but multiple entries might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution, which is a standard command to check user context. That's normal, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe. But alone, not suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell commands again. The fact that they're deleting multiple files in TEMP with -ErrorAction Ignore suggests they're trying to ensure the files are removed even if they don't exist. Maybe part of a script that's cleaning up, but why so many different files? Could be part of a malicious script trying to remove logs or other traces. However, without seeing the contents of the files or more context, it's a bit hard.\n\nThe other events don't show obvious signs of malware, like unexpected network connections, unusual processes, or privilege escalation. The majority of events are normal operations, but the repeated file deletions in TEMP might be a red flag.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's under AppData, which is a common place for user-specific data. But creating a file there might be normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious about the file name or path. The name seems generic, but maybe it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set events involving powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag, especially if it's related to persistence or altering system behavior. But without more context, it's hard to say. The events mention 'RegistryEvent' rules, which might indicate monitoring for such changes.\n\nThen there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. Accessing processes could be normal, but if it's accessing other processes in a way that's not typical, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which processes are being accessed.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances of Remove-Item commands in the TEMP directory. Removing files might be part of cleaning up after an operation, but if it's part of a script that's trying to hide evidence, that's concerning. However, the commands are using -ErrorAction Ignore, which could be to prevent errors if the files don't exist. That's a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThe Image loaded events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell when running .NET code, so that's probably legitimate. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a red herring, but it's part of the system's antivirus, so it's not necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a sign of a script that's executing and then cleaning up, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might indicate that it's part of a malicious payload that's being executed temporarily.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication. Pipes can be used for legitimate purposes, but if there's a lot of them or they're being used in unexpected ways, that could be a concern. However, the log doesn't specify the details, so it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: there are multiple PowerShell activities, including file creation and deletion, registry changes, and loading of DLLs. The repeated use of Remove-Item on temporary files could be part of a script trying to remove evidence. The combination of these events, especially the file creation and deletion, might indicate that something is being executed and then cleaned up, which is a common tactic in malware.

The winlog entries mention \"Process accessed\" and \"Process Create\" rules. The \"Process accessed\" might be a custom rule, but \"Process Create\" is a standard event. The whoami.exe is a legitimate tool that displays user account information, so that's normal. However, PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so multiple accesses could be suspicious.\n\nWait, but there are a lot of repeated entries. Like, multiple lines with the same process and task. That might indicate that the system is logging a lot of activity, but maybe it's normal. However, the fact that PowerShell is being accessed repeatedly could be a red flag. But then again, maybe it's just a script that's running multiple times.\n\nThen, looking further down, there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be normal during setup. However, the other entry is about PowerShell creating a file named \"pacote_ativo.txt\".
