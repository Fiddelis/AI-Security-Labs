{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through each line and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see powershell.exe activities. Let's check those.\n\nOne of the entries has a command line that uses PowerShell to download a file from a GitHub URL. The command is using WebClient's DownloadFile method. Now, downloading files from GitHub isn't inherently bad, but the fact that it's done multiple times with different URLs might be a red flag. Also, the filenames are things like \"modulo_padrao.txt\" and others, which could be benign, but the repetition and the use of temporary directories might be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET Framework DLLs, which is normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's part of Microsoft's antivirus, so that's probably legitimate. But the combination of multiple image loads and the previous file downloads might indicate something.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and then immediately deleting a file could be an attempt to hide activity, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. The fact that the script is named with a random string (like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1) suggests it's trying to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the use of raw.githubusercontent.com might be used to host malicious payloads. The fact that there are five different download commands with different URLs and filenames could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or execute malicious code.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these might be false positives. For example, legitimate scripts might use PowerShell to download files for updates or configuration. But the combination of multiple downloads, temporary file creation and deletion, and the use of PowerShell for network activities without clear user interaction could be signs of a security threat.\n\nThe presence of Registry value set events and ProcessAccess might indicate that the script is modifying system settings or accessing other processes, which could be part of a larger attack. But I need to check if there's any clear malicious intent here. The URLs are all pointing to LICENSE.txt files, which are typically benign. However, the fact that they're being downloaded to temporary directories and executed via PowerShell might be a way to bypass security measures.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows multiple PowerShell activities that could be part of a script-based attack, even if the individual actions aren't overtly malicious. The repetition, use of temporary files, and multiple network connections might indicate a need for further investigation. Therefore, the batch is likely interesting for investigation, but not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell File Downloads from GitHub:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `DownloadFile` commands to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). While GitHub is a legitimate source, the repetition of such downloads (5 instances with different URLs) and temporary filenames (e.g., `modulo_padrao.txt`, `tarefa_geral.txt`) raises concerns. This could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or execute payloads disguised as benign files.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script creates a temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`) in the `%TEMP%` directory and immediately deletes it. This pattern is often used to evade detection by minimizing forensic traces.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**\n   - The use of `Provider Lifecycle` events with PowerShell command lines suggests potential misuse of PowerShell for scripting or automation. While not inherently malicious, the lack of clear user context (e.g., no visible user interaction) adds to the suspicion.\n\n4. **Image Load Events for System DLLs:**\n   - PowerShell loads several system DLLs (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender). While these are legitimate, the combination with other suspicious activities (e.g., file downloads) could indicate an attempt to leverage system processes for malicious purposes.\n\n5. **Network and Registry Activity:**\n   - Chrome.exe's DNS queries and network connections are normal, but the lack of user context for PowerShell-related network activity (e.g., no visible browser interaction) is concerning.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events **requires further investigation** due to the combination of repetitive PowerShell downloads, temporary file manipulation, and lack of clear user context. While individual actions may not be definitively malicious, the patterns align with tactics used in scripting-based attacks or data exfiltration. A deeper analysis (e.g., checking the contents of downloaded files, correlating with other logs, or inspecting user activity) is recommended to confirm benignity or identify potential threats. \n\n**Verdict:** **Interesting for investigation** (likely benign but requires closer scrutiny)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes with command lines that use WebClient.DownloadFile from GitHub URLs. The files are being downloaded to temporary directories. That's suspicious because downloading files from external sources, especially GitHub, might be part of an attack, like downloading malware. But GitHub is also a legitimate source, so I need to check more.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where chrome.exe is setting registry values. A lot of them—eight instances. That's a lot of registry changes from Chrome. Maybe it's normal, but if it's excessive, it could indicate something malicious trying to modify the registry. However, Chrome might have legitimate reasons to change registry keys, like updates or configuration changes.\n\nThen there's a file created by PowerShell in the user's Downloads folder. The file names are things like \"elemento_padrao.txt\" and \"entrada_base.txt\". Not sure what they contain, but creating files in Downloads isn't necessarily bad. However, combined with the previous PowerShell commands, it might be part of a larger action.\n\nAnother event shows a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file is a .yml.new file. That might be part of a configuration change, which could be normal if someone is setting up or updating winlogbeat. But if it's unexpected, it could be an issue.\n\nThere's also a network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That's probably legitimate, as Defender might be communicating with Microsoft servers.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell commands again, they all use the same structure: downloading a LICENSE.txt from a GitHub raw URL. The URLs are from different repositories, but all are downloading to the TEMP directory. The fact that they're using PowerShell to download files might be a red flag, especially if these aren't part of a known legitimate process. However, GitHub is a common source for open-source projects, so it's not definitive.\n\nThe multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be a sign of something trying to modify the registry extensively. But again, Chrome might do that during updates. However, the combination with the PowerShell downloads might indicate a more complex scenario.\n\nAlso, there are several FileCreate events for PowerShell, which might be part of the process's normal operation, but in combination with the other events, it's worth looking into.\n\nConsidering all this, the key points are the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, the numerous registry changes by Chrome, and the file creations. While some of these could be normal, the combination might indicate an investigation is warranted. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough suspicious activity to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands to download files from GitHub URLs using WebClient.DownloadFile, which could indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe the fact that it's loading a system DLL isn't suspicious on its own. Then there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a normal host process, but frequent registry changes could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading the same urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe isn't a standard process name. Normally, it's calc.exe. Maybe that's a typo or a renamed process. That could be a red flag. Also, the command line for some processes like whoami.exe and schtasks.exe are present. Deleting scheduled tasks with commands like SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F might be part of cleaning up after establishing a persistent mechanism. \n\nLooking at the reg.exe commands deleting entries from HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's a common place for malware to hide, so deleting those could be an attempt to remove traces. Also, the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe multiple times, especially with process access and registry events, might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system.\n\nThere's also a conhost.exe involved in registry changes. Conhost is usually related to console windows, so maybe that's normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger pattern. The repetition of certain events, like registry value sets and process accesses, might suggest automated scripts or malware activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry modifications, use of command-line tools to delete scheduled tasks and registry entries, and the presence of processes like powershell and cmd in suspicious contexts. The Calculator.exe might be a typo, but even if it's a mistake, the overall pattern of activity is more than just normal system behavior. The confidence isn't 100% because some entries could be legitimate, but the combination of events points towards potential malicious activity.

There are several entries with \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" tasks. However, the key points here might be the file paths and the types of events.\n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" events, there are entries loading .dll files from Windows directories like System32 and Microsoft.NET. That's typical for PowerShell, but I need to check if any of these are unexpected. The Windows Defender DLLs (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll) are legitimate, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. The creation and immediate deletion of a script file in Temp could be a red flag. It might be part of a script that's being tested or executed, but the fact that it's deleted afterward could be an attempt to hide evidence. However, this could also be a normal operation if the script is being used for legitimate testing.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks with the same command line. This might indicate some kind of loop or automated process, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple \"Process accessed\" events might be normal if PowerShell is being monitored.\n\nThere's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That seems legitimate, especially if it's part of a monitoring setup. The user might be using it to collect logs, which is a normal activity.\n\nHowever, the combination of creating a script file in Temp and then deleting it immediately, along with multiple PowerShell events, could be indicative of a malicious script that's being executed and then cleaned up. But without more evidence like the script content or unusual network activity, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all these points, the logs show some potentially suspicious activities, but they could also be part of normal operations.

Wait, there's also a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file path is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. That name looks like it could be part of a script that's being tested or executed, maybe bypassing some security policies. Also, the image loaded events include .NET DLLs, which might be part of legitimate processes, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it could indicate something malicious. The user 'fiddelis' might be a red herring, but the overall pattern of creating a temp file, executing a script, then deleting it is suspicious.

Then there are several instances of powershell.exe doing various tasks like creating pipes, setting registry values, and accessing processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so I need to check for any unusual patterns.\n\nLooking further, there's a Chrome.exe process with multiple registry value sets. Chrome is a common browser, but if it's modifying the registry a lot, that could be a red flag. However, Chrome does sometimes update its own settings, so maybe not immediately suspicious. \n\nThen there's an entry where powershell.exe is executing a command to remove a file named 'objeto_principal.zip' from the temporary directory. The command line shows \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore\". Deleting a zip file might be part of a cleanup, but why would that be done via PowerShell? Also, the use of -ErrorAction Ignore might be to suppress any errors, which could be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing to note is the image loaded events for PowerShell. It's loading various .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell. But if there were unexpected DLLs loaded from unusual paths, that would be a problem. However, these paths look legitimate.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool for checking user identity. That's probably normal.\n\nNow, looking at the combination of events: multiple PowerShell processes performing registry modifications, process access, and file operations. The removal of a zip file from the temp directory might be part of a larger operation. However, without more context, like the presence of malicious files or network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the fact that there's a specific attempt to delete a zip file named 'objeto_principal.zip' could be significant. Maybe that zip file was part of an attack, and the deletion is an attempt to cover tracks. However, since the file is in the temp directory and the command is using ErrorAction Ignore, it's possible that this is just a benign cleanup. \n\nOn the other hand, the high number of registry changes by Chrome and PowerShell might indicate some form of configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering all that, the batch has some suspicious activities, but not enough to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate operations. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script, which could be benign, but sometimes malicious scripts are dropped here. Then the same file is deleted, which might be part of a cleanup, but why create and delete it?\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is removing various .zip and .txt files from the Temp directory. The command lines use Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore, which might be trying to delete files without causing errors if they don't exist. That could be part of a script that's trying to clean up after itself, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event, which might be related to inter-process communication. Not sure yet, but could be part of something malicious. Also, there are several Registry value set events, but they're from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Chrome setting registry values isn't unusual, but combined with other events?\n\nWait, the first event had a file created and deleted in the Temp folder. The multiple deletions of different files might indicate that someone is trying to remove evidence. Also, the fact that the same script file is created and then deleted quickly could be a red flag. Additionally, the use of $env:TEMP in the command lines suggests that the attacker is using temporary directories to store files, which is a common tactic.\n\nThere's also an entry where powershell.exe accesses another process, which might be part of process injection or other malicious activities. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands removing files might be part of a larger attack, like downloading a payload, executing it, and then cleaning up.\n\nBut I need to check if there's anything more suspicious. The other events involve chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Defender files. So that's probably normal. The whoami.exe process is just a standard command to get user info, so that's benign.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated creation and deletion of files in Temp by PowerShell, along with the Pipe Created event and Process Access, might indicate some form of malicious activity. However, without more evidence like network connections or unusual command-line arguments, it's a bit ambiguous. But the pattern of creating and deleting files in Temp is suspicious. So I'd classify this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns Observed:**\n1. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell creating and subsequently deleting files in the user's temporary directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). \n   - **Why this matters:** While temporary files are common, the pattern of **creating and immediately deleting** files (e.g., `.ps1`, `.txt`, `.zip`) could indicate **evidence cleanup** after executing scripts or payloads. The use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` in `Remove-Item` commands suggests the attacker is avoiding errors if files are missing, which is typical in obfuscation or evasion tactics.\n\n2. **Repetitive File Deletion Commands:**\n   - PowerShell scripts repeatedly attempt to delete files like `tarefa_base.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`, and `estrutura_geral.zip` from the Temp directory. \n   - **Why this matters:** This could be part of a **malicious script's cleanup phase** to remove traces of its activity, such as downloaded payloads or temporary execution files.\n\n3. **Process Access and Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Process accessed` event (ProcessAccess rule) and a `Pipe Created` event are logged. These could indicate **inter-process communication (IPC)** or **process injection**, though further context (e.g., network activity, memory dumps) would be needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - PowerShell and other processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`) modify registry values. While not inherently malicious, combined with the file deletion patterns, this might suggest **configuration changes** to persist or evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity:**\n- **Windows Defender DLLs:** Events involving `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (loaded by Chrome) are normal, as these are part of Windows Defender's anti-malware operations.\n- **Whoami.exe:** The `whoami.exe` process is a standard utility for checking user context and is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries **warrant further investigation** due to the **suspicious file creation\/deletion pattern** and **potential process manipulation**. While no direct evidence of malware is present, the behavior aligns with tactics used in **malware cleanup phases** or **script-based attacks**. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Correlate these logs with **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) or **memory dumps** to check for process injection.\n- Investigate the **source of the PowerShell scripts** (e.g., are they being downloaded from external sources?).\n- Monitor for **unusual registry changes** that could indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Classification:** **Interesting for further investigation** (likely benign but requires deeper analysis)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is running a command to remove a file in the TEMP directory. The command uses Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That's a bit suspicious because deleting files, especially with those flags, might be part of cleaning up after some activity. But maybe it's just a normal script?\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts, but the presence of Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll could be a red flag. Why would a script load Defender's components? Maybe it's trying to bypass detection or interact with the antivirus?\n\nNext, there are multiple file creations and deletions in the TEMP directory. The files have names like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like it could be related to PowerShell script execution. Creating and then deleting files might be part of an attack to avoid leaving traces. Also, the repeated deletion of files named with different prefixes (unidade_base.txt, registro_auxiliar.txt, etc.) suggests a pattern, which might be part of a larger operation.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard command to get user information, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs and the use of PowerShell to manipulate files in TEMP directories are concerning. The combination of these events might indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell for malicious purposes, such as executing scripts, evading detection, or preparing for further attacks.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell scripts often use the TEMP directory for temporary files. The loading of .NET DLLs is normal for many applications. But the frequency and the specific commands (like deleting multiple files with -Force) might be more indicative of malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch has several suspicious activities that, when combined, suggest potential malicious intent. The confidence isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious activities** that collectively suggest **potential malicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**:\n1. **PowerShell File Manipulation**:\n   - Repeated use of `Remove-Item` with `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` to delete files in the **TEMP directory** (e.g., `unidade_base.txt`, `registro_auxiliar.txt`, `pacote_ativo.txt`). This could indicate **cleanup of temporary files** or **deletion of evidence** after malicious activity.\n\n2. **Abnormal DLL Loading**:\n   - PowerShell loads **Windows Defender-related DLLs** (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). This is unusual and may suggest **interaction with antivirus components** (e.g., bypassing detection, tampering with security tools).\n\n3. **File Creation in Sensitive Locations**:\n   - Files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest...` and `objeto_padrao.txt` are created in **user directories** or **PowerShell-specific paths**. These could be **staging areas for scripts** or **dropped payloads**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` events involving `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` hint at **potential persistence mechanisms** or **privilege escalation attempts**.\n\n5. **Lateral Movement Indicators**:\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` (to check user context) combined with file operations suggests **reconnaissance** or **preparation for lateral movement**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious**:\n- **Legitimate**: PowerShell is a common tool for system administration, and temporary file creation\/deletion is normal. `.NET DLLs` are often loaded during script execution.\n- **Malicious**: The **repetitive deletion of files**, **unusual DLL loading**, and **suspicious file naming** (e.g., `objeto_padrao.txt`) deviate from typical behavior, raising concerns about **malware execution** or **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **highly indicative of potential malicious activity**, such as **script-based attacks**, **data exfiltration**, or **antivirus evasion**. While not conclusive proof of compromise, the **combination of file manipulation, registry access, and unusual DLL loading** warrants **further analysis** (e.g., checking file hashes, inspecting PowerShell scripts, reviewing defender logs).\n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (75-85%) – The pattern is consistent with **malicious behavior** but requires additional context to confirm."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a lot of repeats. Chrome modifying the registry... Hmm, but chrome.exe is a common process, and it's possible that it's doing legitimate things like updating settings or extensions. However, repeated registry changes might be a red flag if they're unexpected. But on their own, without more context, maybe not a big deal yet.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe doing the same registry set. RuntimeBroker is part of the Windows system, so that's probably normal. It handles permissions for apps, so maybe that's just part of its function. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there are several instances of powershell.exe with the task \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\". PowerShell is a common tool, but it's also often used in attacks. However, just accessing processes isn't necessarily malicious. But combined with other events, it might be more suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of whoami.exe being created with the command line \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". Whoami.exe is a legitimate tool that displays user information. However, if it's being executed repeatedly, maybe that's part of a script or a reconnaissance phase. But again, on its own, it's not necessarily bad. The command line seems normal.\n\nLooking at the later entries, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's installed, that's normal. But the file path is in the user's Downloads, which might be unexpected. However, maybe the user is just installing or configuring it there.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe creating a file called \"pacote_ativo.txt\". The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red flag if it's a known malicious filename or if the content is suspicious. But without seeing the content of the file, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that PowerShell is creating a file could be part of normal operations, like generating logs or scripts. But if this is part of a larger pattern, like downloading or executing malicious code, that's a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity with PowerShell and whoami.exe, which are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. The repeated registry changes by Chrome and RuntimeBroker might be normal, but the combination with PowerShell's file creation and access could indicate something. However, the justification for being interesting would be if there's a pattern that suggests unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
