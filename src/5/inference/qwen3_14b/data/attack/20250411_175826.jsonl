{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are entries for ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe with registry value set events. Some of these are normal processes, but powershell.exe is often used in attacks. However, just having registry changes might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an entry for chrome.exe accessing a pipe. Chrome usually doesn't create pipes, so that's a red flag. Also, there are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. Chrome shouldn't be modifying the registry much, especially if it's happening repeatedly. That could indicate something's wrong.\n\nLooking further, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, but if it's being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be normal. However, another image load is for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's Platform. That's also a legitimate file, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's a file created event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. Creating a configuration file might be part of setup. Another file created by powershell.exe is a text file in the Downloads folder. That's probably user activity, not malicious.\n\nBut wait, the chrome.exe process is involved in multiple registry changes and pipe creation. The repetition of registry events might suggest an ongoing process trying to modify settings. Also, the pipe creation could be part of inter-process communication, but if it's not expected, that's suspicious.\n\nHowever, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of normal operations, like updates or user actions. The presence of legitimate files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded might be normal. The file creations are in user directories, which are common for downloads.\n\nBut the high number of registry changes by chrome.exe is unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry extensively. This might indicate a compromise where the browser is being used to execute malicious code that's altering the registry. However, without more context, like unexpected network activity or unauthorized access, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nConsidering all that, the logs show some unusual behavior, but not enough to confirm a security incident. It's on the edge. The confidence might be around 0.6. The classification would be INTERESTING because there are multiple suspicious events that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes triggered unusual registry modifications and pipe creation events, which are not typical for a standard browser. This could indicate potential malicious activity or exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. Now, PowerShell is often used by attackers, but just seeing ProcessAccess events might not be enough. \n\nWait, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a standard command to get user info, but again, not necessarily malicious. Then, looking further, there's a PowerShell command that's modifying the LastWriteTime of a file to a specific date. That seems odd. Why would someone change the timestamp of a file to January 1, 1970? That's the Unix epoch, which might be a red flag. It could be an attempt to hide the file's true modification time, possibly to evade detection.\n\nThen, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate .NET DLLs, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might be a bit concerning. However, Windows Defender's DLLs are usually legitimate. \n\nThere's a FileCreate and then FileDeleteDetected for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script and then cleaning up. However, it's also possible that it's part of a legitimate process, like a temporary file used during an operation. \n\nThe PipeEvent for PowerShell might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad. But combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger pattern. \n\nThe other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values are probably normal. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, and Notepad can be used for various purposes, but registry changes could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the PowerShell command modifying file timestamps, the creation and deletion of a temporary script, and the multiple image loads. However, these could also be part of a legitimate activity, such as a script that's being tested or a system update. But the fact that the timestamp is set to 1970 is a bit suspicious. \n\nConfidence is a bit tricky. There's enough odd behavior to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of malicious activity. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the unusual file timestamp modification and the temporary script file creation\/deletion, which might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or execute a script.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., modifying file timestamps to 1970-01-01, creating\/deleting temporary scripts), combined with frequent image loads and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are several entries with powershell.exe. The command lines in some of them look suspicious. For example, they're using Get-ChildItem on various file paths and then setting the LastWriteTime to 01\/01\/1970, which is the Unix epoch. That's a common trick used in malware to modify timestamps, possibly to hide activities or manipulate file metadata. \n\nWait, the paths mentioned are all over the place, like \"C:\\\\modulo_logico\\\\registro_base\\\\..\\\\componente_padrao\\\\modulo_logicoelemento_ativo.txt\". The use of \"..\\\\\" suggests navigating up directories, which might be part of a larger path manipulation. But are these legitimate paths or something else? Maybe the attacker is trying to access files in different directories to alter their timestamps. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe with the same pattern of modifying LastWriteTime. That repetition could indicate a script or automated process running multiple times. But why would someone do that? Maybe to hide the presence of other malicious activities by changing timestamps, making it harder to detect changes in the file system.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll. That's a normal system file, so maybe just regular processes. Then there's svchost.exe setting registry values, which is common for Windows services but could be part of a larger attack if done excessively or in unusual contexts. However, the events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity here beyond the PowerShell commands.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a legitimate installation or configuration, but the presence of a new .yml file could be something to check, especially if it's not expected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points are the PowerShell commands modifying timestamps. This behavior is often associated with malware trying to evade detection. The fact that there are multiple similar events with the same pattern increases the suspicion. Even though some other processes are normal, the repeated PowerShell activity stands out. \n\nHowever, I should also consider false positives. Maybe these are part of a legitimate script that's modifying timestamps for some reason. But the use of \"..\\\\\" and the specific timestamp (epoch) is more indicative of malicious intent. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has multiple PowerShell events that are modifying file timestamps in a way that's commonly seen in attacks. That makes it interesting enough for further investigation. The confidence is high because of the repeated suspicious behavior, even if other events are normal.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to '01\/01\/1970 00:00:00' (Unix epoch), a common technique used by malware to hide activity by resetting timestamps. This pattern repeats across 7 events with varying file paths, suggesting potential evasion tactics.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
