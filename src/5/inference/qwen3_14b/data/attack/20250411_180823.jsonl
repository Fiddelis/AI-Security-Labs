{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries where the process is chrome.exe and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's repeated multiple times. Then there are a couple of entries with powershell.exe and a ProcessAccess event, and one with whoami.exe.\n\nHmm, chrome.exe modifying the registry... Well, Chrome is a common application, but modifying the registry could be normal if it's updating its own settings. However, if it's doing this multiple times, maybe there's something unusual. But I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate tool that displays user account information. But why is it being created? The command line shows it's running from the system32 directory, which is normal. But if it's part of a sequence of events, maybe it's being used for privilege escalation or to check user rights. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThe PowerShell processes with ProcessAccess events might indicate that another process is accessing PowerShell, which could be part of a script or command. But again, this is common in many scenarios. However, if combined with other events, it might be a sign of something more.\n\nWait, but looking at the entire batch, all the events are from legitimate processes. Chrome modifying the registry might be normal, like updating its configuration. The whoami and PowerShell events are standard. There's no indication of failed attempts, errors, or unusual parameters. No mention of network connections, file modifications, or other suspicious activities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. They are all within the bounds of normal operations for the mentioned processes. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no suspicious activity detected in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe) performing normal operations (registry modifications, process access). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's common, but not necessarily malicious. However, there's one event where 'svchost.exe' created a file in the Windows Tasks directory: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. Creating a task in the System32 Tasks folder can be a red flag because that's where scheduled tasks are stored. If an attacker creates a task there, it might be to execute malicious code at startup.\n\nThen there's a 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' doing registry changes. PowerShell is often used in attacks, but alone it's not suspicious. The 'powershell.exe' also created a file called 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. That might be benign, but depending on the content, it could be part of something malicious. However, just creating a text file isn't a strong indicator.\n\nAnother point is the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably normal. The 'chrome.exe' loading 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll' are legitimate files from Windows Defender. That seems normal too.\n\nBut the key point here is the creation of the task in the System32 Tasks folder. That's a high-risk area. Even if other events are normal, that single file creation could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. Also, the repetition of registry changes by chrome and svchost might be part of a larger activity, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of the task creation is a strong indicator. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the classification should be INTERESTING because of the suspicious file creation in the System32 Tasks directory. The confidence is around 0.7 because while that event is concerning, it's not definitive proof of malicious activity without further analysis. But it's enough to warrant an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by system processes (svchost.exe, chrome.exe) combined with a suspicious file creation in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup) indicate potential persistence mechanism attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so maybe legitimate, but notepad.exe modifying the registry could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. Then, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but if it's being loaded from an unusual context, that might be a problem. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, so that's probably normal.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line shows creating tasks named \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\" which run calc.exe. That seems odd because scheduled tasks with names like these might be part of a malicious payload. Also, the command line uses schtasks to create tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. Since calc.exe is a legitimate program, but creating tasks with such names could be a sign of something malicious, especially if the user didn't authorize it.\n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe process creating another task called \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same pattern. The creation of multiple scheduled tasks with similar naming conventions might be an indicator of a malicious actor trying to persist on the system. Also, the tasks are set to run on logon and startup, which could be an attempt to maintain access.\n\nAnother entry shows svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory. svchost is a legitimate process, but creating files in system directories could be suspicious. However, the file path mentioned is C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon, which is where scheduled tasks are stored. So that might be normal, but if the tasks themselves are malicious, that's a problem.\n\nPutting this together, the key suspicious points are the multiple scheduled tasks created by schtasks.exe with unusual names, the use of cmd.exe to execute calc.exe, and the potential for persistence through these tasks. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of creating multiple tasks with non-standard names and the use of calc.exe (which is often used in malware like the \"calc\" payload) might indicate a malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the pattern here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious scheduled tasks are created with obfuscated names (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon'), and cmd.exe is used to execute calc.exe in a way that suggests potential persistence mechanisms. The pattern of task creation and non-standard process behavior indicates possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
