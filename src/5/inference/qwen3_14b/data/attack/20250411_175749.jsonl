{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few lines, there are multiple entries with the task \"Execute a Remote Command\", but the process and file fields are None. That might be a red flag because executing a remote command without any associated process or file could indicate something malicious, but maybe it's a false positive or a misconfigured log.\n\nThen, there's an entry for \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" with powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's suspicious. Next, a \"Process Create\" event for whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command but could be part of a larger attack. However, the command line here is just running whoami, which is normal.\n\nThen again, powershell.exe is accessed multiple times. The next event is a registry value set by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms. Then, a process create for cmd.exe with a command line that uses SCHTASKS to create a task named \"spawn\" that runs cmd.exe at 20:10. Creating scheduled tasks can be a way to execute code later, which is suspicious.\n\nFollowing that, there's an image loaded by schtasks.exe pointing to taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate file, but the context here might be important. Then, registry value sets by svchost.exe multiple times. Svchost is a common host process, but frequent registry changes could indicate something wrong. Then, a file created by svchost.exe at \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\spawn\". Creating a task in the System32\\Tasks directory is a common place for scheduled tasks, but if it's being created by svchost, that might be unusual.\n\nMore registry changes by cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Then, a bunch of \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries again. So, putting this all together, there's a pattern of creating a scheduled task, modifying the registry, and using processes like powershell, cmd, and schtasks. These actions are often seen in attack scenarios, such as establishing persistence or executing commands remotely.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be normal system activities. For example, scheduled tasks are part of Windows, and svchost hosting various services. But the repetition of \"Execute a Remote Command\" without process details and the creation of a task named \"spawn\" which might be a backdoor or malicious task, combined with registry modifications, suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate because while some events are suspicious, others could be benign. But the combination of multiple suspicious events (like creating a task, registry changes, and repeated remote command executions) makes it more likely that this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected, including repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' logs, creation of a scheduled task named 'spawn' via SCHTASKS, registry modifications by PowerShell and svchost.exe, and process access to PowerShell.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with process and file set to None. That's a bit suspicious because usually, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process involved. But maybe these are just placeholders or errors in the log collection? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's an event with \"Process Create\" for WmiPrvSE.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process related to WMI. The command line looks normal: wmiprvse.exe with -secured and -Embedding flags. That's typical for WMI provider services. So that might be benign.\n\nNext, an \"Image loaded\" event for WmiPrvSE.exe loading wmiutils.dll from the System32 directory. That's a standard DLL, so probably okay. But I should check if there are any anomalies here. No obvious issues so far.\n\nThen there's a \"File created\" event for winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But maybe the path is unusual? The user fiddelis is mentioned, but without more context, it's hard to say. Could be a legitimate user activity.\n\nLooking at the Registry value set events: several entries involving ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a pattern, like multiple changes from the same process, it might be suspicious. However, in this case, the processes involved are common applications. For example, Calculator.exe modifying the registry is odd, but maybe it's part of some legitimate operation? Not sure yet.\n\nThe \"Process accessed\" event for powershell.exe might be normal, but PowerShell is often used in attacks, so it's something to note. However, without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe \"Pipe Created\" event for chrome.exe is unusual. Chrome typically doesn't create named pipes, so this might be a red flag. Maybe a malicious process is using Chrome's context to create a pipe for communication.\n\nThen, multiple \"Registry value set\" events for chrome.exe. If Chrome is modifying its own registry keys, that's normal. But if it's modifying other keys or doing so frequently, it could be suspicious. However, the logs here don't specify which keys are being modified, so I can't be certain.\n\nThe \"Image loaded\" events for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs: amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. So that's normal.\n\nThere are also \"Process Create\" events for svchost.exe with different parameters. Svchost.exe is a standard Windows process that hosts multiple services. The command lines here seem legitimate, like running under different service groups. No obvious issues there.\n\nThe \"Logon\" event for services.exe is normal, as services.exe is part of the Windows Services. The \"Special Logon\" event with no process or file is a bit vague. Maybe it's a logon type that doesn't involve a process, but it's worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points of interest are:\n\n1. Multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process or file. This could be a log collection issue or a real event without proper data.\n2. The \"Pipe Created\" event for chrome.exe, which is unusual.\n3. Registry modifications by various processes, but without more context, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nHowever, none of the events show clear signs of malware or attacks. The processes involved are mostly legitimate, and the unusual events (like the pipe creation) are isolated. Without more data, like network activity, file hashes, or user behavior, it's difficult to confirm any malicious intent. Therefore, the logs might not be highly suspicious, but the \"Execute a Remote Command\" and \"Pipe Created\" events warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and a few potentially suspicious events. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events (No Process\/File):**\n   - **Suspiciousness:** High.\n   - **Analysis:** Multiple logs indicate \"Execute a Remote Command\" with `process` and `file` fields set to `None`. This could indicate incomplete log data, misconfiguration, or potentially malicious activity where the originating process is obfuscated or not captured. Further investigation into system-wide remote execution (e.g., WMI, PowerShell remoting, or RPC) is warranted.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **WmiPrvSE.exe** (WMI provider host): The `command_line` (`-secured -Embedding`) aligns with standard WMI operations.\n   - **svchost.exe** (Windows service host): The command-line parameters (`-k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted`, etc.) match known Windows service group configurations.\n\n3. **Unusual \"Pipe Created\" Event for Chrome.exe:**\n   - **Suspiciousness:** Moderate.\n   - **Analysis:** Chrome typically does not create named pipes. This could indicate a compromise where an attacker is using Chrome as a proxy for inter-process communication (IPC), or it may be a false positive (e.g., a third-party Chrome extension). Further checks for anomalous network activity or injected code into Chrome processes are needed.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Processes Involved:** `Calculator.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`.\n   - **Analysis:** While registry changes are common, the involvement of `Calculator.exe` (a standard application) and `chrome.exe` (which may interact with the registry for settings) could be benign. However, the volume or specific keys modified would need contextual analysis to determine legitimacy.\n\n5. **File Creation by Winlogbeat.exe:**\n   - **Context:** Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper. Creating a `.yml.new` file in the user's `Downloads` directory is typical during configuration updates. No immediate red flags here.\n\n6. **Logon\/Logoff Events:**\n   - **\"Special Logon\" Event:** This is a generic logon type (e.g., network logon, batch logon) and may not be suspicious without additional context (e.g., user account, source IP).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events:** Check for correlated network traffic, process tree analysis, or signs of remote code execution (e.g., PowerShell scripts, WMI queries).\n- **Analyze the \"Pipe Created\" Event:** Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDot** to inspect Chrome's behavior and verify if the pipe is connected to unexpected processes or network endpoints.\n- **Review Registry Changes:** Audit the specific registry keys modified by `Calculator.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `chrome.exe` to ensure they align with expected application behavior.\n- **Validate Winlogbeat Activity:** Confirm that the `.yml.new` file was created by a legitimate user and is not part of a configuration attack (e.g., injection of malicious settings).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs contain no definitive evidence of a security incident, the **\"Execute a Remote Command\"** and **\"Pipe Created\"** events merit further investigation. The rest of the activity appears consistent with normal system and application behavior. A deeper dive into process context, network traffic, and registry modifications would clarify whether these events are benign or indicative of a threat."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is a file creation by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder. That's a common action, maybe part of normal user activity. Then there are eight consecutive entries where chrome.exe sets registry values. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that's a red flag. Multiple identical events in a row could indicate a script or automated process, possibly malicious. The last event is another file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a legitimate tool for log collection, but the file path seems to be part of an installation or configuration process. However, the main concern here is the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe. That's unusual and might be related to persistence mechanisms or other malicious activities. Even though there's one legitimate file creation, the repeated registry events make this batch suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple consecutive registry value modifications by chrome.exe (8 instances) are highly unusual and could indicate malicious activity.
