{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file called .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which sometimes is used for temporary files. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is common, but creating a file in Downloads could be normal too. Maybe someone is just saving a file. But maybe not, depending on context.\n\nThen, two instances of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. ProcessAccess usually indicates that a process is accessing another process, which can be a sign of something malicious, like injection. But it's also possible that it's just normal activity, like scripts interacting with other processes.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is created, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. That seems normal. But if it's being used in a suspicious context, maybe. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily bad.\n\nPutting it all together: The main flags are the ProcessAccess events on PowerShell. Those could indicate that something is trying to access or manipulate another process, which is a common technique in malware. However, without more context, like if there are other suspicious activities or if these events are part of a known benign process, it's hard to tell. But the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might be a red flag. Also, the creation of files in the Downloads folder might be normal, but combined with the ProcessAccess, it could be part of a larger pattern. \n\nBut wait, the user said to consider the entire batch. Are there any other indicators? The first event is a legitimate process creating a config file. The whoami is normal. The other PowerShell events could be benign. However, the ProcessAccess events might be more suspicious. But without more data, like network activity or other logs, it's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the key here is the ProcessAccess events. They're not common in normal user activities. So even though some parts are normal, the combination might be worth investigating. Therefore, the classification would be INTERESTING with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. Justification is the ProcessAccess events on PowerShell which could indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process access events for powershell.exe and file creation in suspicious directories may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. One entry stands out: the cmd.exe command line includes creating a scheduled task with schtasks. The command line is setting up a daily task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policies. The script path mentioned is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" in it. That might be a red flag because if the script doesn't exist, that could be a sign of a failed attack or maybe a typo. But sometimes attackers use such names to avoid detection. \n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task named \"win32times\" with the same PowerShell command. Also, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times, which is the location where scheduled tasks are stored. That seems normal, but the combination with the PowerShell command is suspicious.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_geral.txt. Not sure if that's malicious, but maybe it's just a normal file. However, the presence of multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe and svchost.exe might be normal, but the repeated registry changes could indicate some tampering.\n\nAlso, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. That might be part of a log shipping process, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the scheduled task creation with PowerShell using -ep bypass and the non-existing script. That could be an attempt to execute a script that's not present, which might be a failed attack or a setup for future execution. The other events might be benign. However, the presence of these commands and the non-existing script path is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75 because there are clear signs of suspicious scheduled tasks and PowerShell usage, but there's not enough evidence to confirm it as malicious without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious PowerShell usage with '-ep bypass' and scheduled task creation via schtasks.exe, which is often used in attack chains. The script path references a non-existing file (NonExistingScript.ps1), indicating potential malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
