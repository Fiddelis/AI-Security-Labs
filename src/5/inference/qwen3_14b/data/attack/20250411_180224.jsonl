{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag. Then I see schtasks.exe being used to create scheduled tasks with the \/ru system parameter, which means it's running as the system account. That's a bit concerning because creating tasks with system privileges can be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThe command lines for schtasks include running PowerShell with -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policies. The scripts mentioned, like c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1, don't exist (since they're named as NonExistingScript), which might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not actually there, possibly a typo or a setup for later. \n\nAlso, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times, which is a scheduled task. Creating tasks in that directory is normal, but combined with the other events, it might be part of a plan to have persistent access. \n\nOther processes like svchost.exe and chrome.exe have multiple registry value set events. While svchost is normal, multiple registry changes could be part of configuration changes or malware. However, chrome.exe having many registry events might just be normal browser activity unless there's something else pointing to it. \n\nThere are also file creation events for winlogbeat.yml.new and some text files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be part of normal operations, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of someone trying to set up data exfiltration. \n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of data exfiltration, malware downloads, or obvious malicious payloads. The suspicious parts are the scheduled tasks with system privileges and the use of PowerShell with bypassed execution policies. The fact that the scripts don't exist might be a red flag, but it's possible that the attacker is testing or the scripts are created later. \n\nPutting it all together, there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. The classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75 because while not all events are malicious, the combination of elevated privileges, scheduled tasks, and bypassing execution policies is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with system privileges using schtasks.exe, PowerShell executed with -ep bypass (common in attacks), and non-existent script paths referenced. These patterns suggest potential privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
