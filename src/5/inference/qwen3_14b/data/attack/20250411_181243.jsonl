{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. That's common, but the command line in one of the entries stands out. The command_line shows a series of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system, users, and groups. That's suspicious because such activities could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker trying to map the network or find vulnerabilities.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but the number of times they're loaded might be a red flag. Also, there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a script could be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be normal, but combined with the other activities, they could indicate something unusual. The fact that the same PowerShell process is accessing the registry and loading multiple DLLs might suggest that it's trying to run a payload or bypass security measures.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any benign explanation. Maybe this is part of a legitimate script or tool that's just doing a lot of system checks. But the combination of multiple sensitive commands, file creation and deletion, and loading of specific DLLs increases the likelihood of malicious activity. The presence of 'cmdkey.exe \/list' could be checking stored credentials, which is a potential red flag.\n\nOverall, the pattern of activities seems to align with what an attacker might do during the initial phases of a cyber attackâ€”gathering information and setting up for further actions. So, I think this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-childitem C:\\\\Users') and loading .NET DLLs, combined with temporary script file creation\/deletion, suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the process entries. There are several entries with the same command line in PowerShell. The command line includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands seem to be gathering information about local users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because such activities are often part of reconnaissance in an attack.\n\nThen, there's a process for net.exe with the command \"user\", which is part of the standard net command to list users. But when combined with other PowerShell commands, it might be part of a larger effort to map the system.\n\nAnother entry mentions \"net1.exe\" with the same user command. That's odd because \"net1.exe\" isn't a standard Windows executable. Maybe a typo or a malicious replacement. That could be suspicious.\n\nThere's a file access event where \"winlogbeat.exe\" creates a new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new configuration file might be normal. However, the presence of multiple security group and user account management events in the logs could indicate changes to user permissions or groups, which might be part of an attack.\n\nThe winlog events mention tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle,\" \"Engine Lifecycle,\" \"Pipe Created,\" \"Image loaded,\" and \"Process Create.\" The \"Image loaded\" event points to MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's any unusual activity with that DLL, it could be a concern.\n\nHowever, the majority of the entries are repetitive PowerShell commands that are checking system information. While that's not necessarily malicious, when combined with the other events like the suspicious net1.exe and multiple security-related tasks, it could indicate an attacker trying to gather information and modify system settings.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The PowerShell commands alone aren't enough to be certain, but the combination with other events like the non-standard net1.exe and the multiple security group tasks raises suspicion. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75 because there are enough indicators that warrant further investigation, even if they aren't definitive proof of a breach.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands executing system reconnaissance activities (user enumeration, credential storage listing, file system access) combined with suspicious process creation (net1.exe) and security-related winlog events suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. The user wants me to look at the entire batch and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. There are several entries with 'Security Group Management' in the winlog task. But that's a normal Windows task, maybe related to user or group management. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's 'cmdkey.exe' listing credentials. That could be normal if someone is checking stored credentials, but maybe suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern. However, there's no immediate red flag here.\n\nLooking at 'powershell.exe' entries. There are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and FileCreate. One file created is 'elemento_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder. Another is a StartupProfileData file. Creating files in AppData might be normal, but sometimes attackers use such locations to hide files. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' running 'localgroup'. 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows command. That's a red flag. Maybe a typo or a malicious executable. The presence of 'net1.exe' could indicate someone trying to manipulate local groups, which might be part of privilege escalation.\n\nRegistry value set events involve several processes, including powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, etc. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without knowing what specific values are changed, it's hard to say. But multiple registry changes by different processes might be suspicious.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal during setup. But if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of tampering.\n\nThere's also 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. Both are legitimate system processes, and urlmon.dll is a standard Windows DLL. Unless there's a different path or unexpected behavior, this might be normal.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' command is standard for checking user context. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of 'net1.exe' (non-standard) and multiple file creations and registry changes by powershell.exe could indicate some level of malicious activity. However, some of these events could be benign. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough suspicious elements to warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses, file creations in user directories, and suspicious process executions (e.g., 'net1.exe' instead of standard 'net.exe') suggest potential malicious activity. Registry modifications and credential-related commands add to the risk indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
