First, I'll scan through the events to spot any unusual patterns.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory, including a file named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. That path is part of Windows Update, so maybe that's normal. But then there's MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating several files in the Windows Temp directory with names like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. These files might be part of signature updates, but the presence of multiple files with similar names could be suspicious. \n\nLooking further, setup.exe is creating several executables in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and elevation_service.exe. These could be legitimate if it's part of an Edge update, but the presence of multiple files and the use of setup.exe might indicate an installation or update process. However, I should check if these are standard files.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry and PowerShell being accessed. RuntimeBroker is usually involved in app permissions, so the registry change might be normal. PowerShell access alone isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: The main points are the svchost.exe creating a patch file, MpSigStub.exe generating multiple temp files, and setup.exe creating Edge-related executables. The temp files from MpSigStub might be part of a legitimate update, but the combination with setup.exe creating multiple files in Edge's directory could indicate an unusual installation or potential malware. However, since these are all system processes and paths associated with Windows Defender and Edge updates, it's possible that this is just normal activity. But the high number of file creations and the specific names might be worth investigating further. I'll lean towards INTERESTING but with moderate confidence because while some activities are normal, the combination and volume might suggest something more.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe) are creating files in system directories (SoftwareDistribution, Temp, EdgeCore) with names suggesting updates or patches.

So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. The main process here is svchost.exe, which is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. \n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to the Registry value being set, which is normal for system operations. However, there are a few File created events. The files mentioned are in directories like C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic, C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs, and similar paths. Some of these files have names like waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl and edbtmp.log. \n\nNow, I know that waasmedic is related to Windows Update and the Windows Activation and Software Licensing service. The .etl files are trace logs, which are used for performance analysis. Similarly, the SoftwareDistribution folder is part of Windows Update. The presence of these files might be normal during an update process. However, the repeated creation of these files could be a sign of something unusual, especially if they're being created in large numbers or at unexpected times.\n\nAnother thing to note is that svchost.exe is legitimate, but if it's creating a lot of files in these directories, it might be part of a malicious activity, such as a worm or a malware that's trying to persist or spread. However, without more context, like the frequency of these events, the user's system state, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe logs also include an entry where the process is None, which might be an error or a system event without a clear process. The file created there is in WindowsUpdate Logs, which again could be part of normal update activity.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear signs of a security threat. The events are mostly related to system updates and logging, which are normal. However, the high number of Registry value sets and file creations might be worth investigating further, but on their own, they might not be conclusive. The confidence level is moderate, so maybe around 0.6.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several ProcessAccess events, which might be normal, but I should check for any suspicious activity. Then there's a ProcessCreate event with a command line that seems a bit complex. Let me look at that line again: it's importing a module from a path that includes \"..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of relative paths with multiple dots might be a red flag, as it could indicate trying to access files outside the intended directory. Also, the command line has some obfuscation with the backslashes and quotes. That might be an attempt to hide the true path or make analysis harder.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading these DLLs isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it could be part of a larger process. The FileCreate and FileDelete events in the Temp directory might be normal, but the creation of a temporary script file and then deleting it could be part of a script that's trying to execute something and clean up afterward. However, the fact that the file is deleted might be an attempt to avoid leaving evidence.\n\nThere's also a PipeCreated event, which could be used for inter-process communication. While that's not inherently malicious, in the context of multiple PowerShell processes and unusual file operations, it might be part of a coordinated attack.\n\nThe svchost.exe events are related to Windows Update logs and registry changes, which are typically normal. Unless there's something unusual in those events, they might not be a concern here.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell command line with the obfuscated path and the import of a module from a non-standard location. That could indicate the execution of a malicious script. The multiple ImageLoads and the temporary file operations might be part of the same process. However, without more context, like the actual content of the module or other indicators of compromise, it's a bit tricky. But given the obfuscation and the unusual path, this seems worth investigating further. The confidence is medium to high, maybe around 0.75.

There's RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, powershell.exe, and others like backgroundTaskHost.exe and msedgewebview2.exe. Now, svchost.exe is a common system process, so that's normal. RuntimeBroker.exe is also a legitimate Windows process. However, HxTsr.exe rings a bell. Wait, isn't HxTsr.exe associated with malware? Maybe a backdoor or something? I should check that. But I can't access external info, so I'll have to rely on known patterns.\n\nLooking at the events: several entries mention \"Registry value set\" and \"File created\". The files created are in standard system directories like C:\\Windows\\System32 and C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution. The SoftwareDistribution folder is related to Windows Update, so creating files there might be part of an update process. But then there's the sppsvc.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That might be normal, but I need to check.\n\nWait, the HxTsr.exe process is setting a registry value. If that's a legitimate process, it's okay. But if it's malware, that's a red flag. Since I don't have info on HxTsr.exe's legitimacy, maybe that's a point of interest. Also, multiple svchost.exe instances are creating files in SoftwareDistribution. That could be part of a legitimate update, but if there's an unusual number of files or unexpected ones, that's suspicious. However, the filenames here like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., might be part of a Windows Update package. \n\nAnother thing: the Image loaded events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate DLLs, but if they're being loaded from unexpected locations or by unusual processes, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so that seems okay.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be normal, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nSo, the main points are HxTsr.exe's presence and the multiple file creations under SoftwareDistribution. If HxTsr.exe is not a known legitimate process, that's a concern.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first event shows a PowerShell command importing a module from a path that includes \"..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Then it tries to invoke a function called Invoke-entrada_principal and starts a service. The next several events are about creating and starting a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". There are multiple instances of the same service creation command. Then there are events related to executing a remote command, with the same PowerShell script file being referenced multiple times.\n\nHmm, the repetition of the same commands might be a red flag. Creating a service multiple times could be an attempt to persist the malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to import a module from a non-standard path suggests possible malicious activity. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" and the binary path might be part of a setup to maintain access. The fact that the same file is executed multiple times under \"Execute a Remote Command\" could indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure the script runs even if some attempts fail. \n\nBut wait, are these commands part of a legitimate application? The paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\\" are not standard, which might be a sign of something unusual. The use of New-Service and Start-Service could be legitimate, but combined with the other events, it's more suspicious.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Then there's the 'whoami.exe' which is a legitimate command, but maybe used here for reconnaissance. \n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's creating a new service called 'objeto_ativo' with a binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe'. That seems suspicious because creating a new service could be part of establishing persistence. Also, the path is in a non-standard directory like 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\', which might not be a typical location for system services. \n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. While some of these are legitimate, the fact that so many are loaded could indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts or payloads. Also, the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender might be normal, but if this is part of a malicious process, it could be trying to bypass detection.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file is created and then deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The name of the file is a PowerShell script policy test, which could be a legitimate test, but combined with other activities, it might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe 'services.exe' entries are modifying the registry multiple times. While services.exe is a legitimate process, repeated registry changes might indicate configuration changes to persist or modify system behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: creating a new service, loading multiple DLLs, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications. These activities could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system. However, without more context, it's possible that some of these are legitimate.

My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them have the same structure. The \"winlog\" task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is always 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are a few entries with different tasks like 'Logon', 'Special Logon', 'Security Group Management', but those don't have any file paths associated. \n\nNow, the key thing here is that the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times. The fact that it's a .ps1 file (PowerShell script) and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" raises a red flag. Typically, executing remote commands via PowerShell can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's happening repeatedly. \n\nBut wait, I should consider the context. Are there any legitimate uses for this? Maybe, but the repetition of the same script path multiple times without any variation is suspicious. Also, the process is listed as \"None\" for most entries, which might mean that the event is not tied to a specific process, or maybe there's a lack of process information. That could indicate that the system might not have logged the process details, which is another point to consider.\n\nHowever, there are also entries with \"services.exe\" and tasks like \"Logon\" which are normal system processes. But the majority of the logs are the same PowerShell script being executed. The confidence here would depend on how unusual this is. If this is a normal system behavior, then it's not interesting. But if this script isn't known or if there's no prior authorization for remote execution, then it's a potential security incident.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided any additional context about the environment, I have to assume that repeated execution of the same script from the same path, especially with remote command execution, is a sign of potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries, there are several events where the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' is loading image files like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are all .NET Framework DLLs located in standard Windows directories. That seems normal because .NET applications typically load these files. So maybe that's just regular application behavior.\n\nThen there's a log entry where 'powershell.exe' creates a file in the AppData directory. That's a common place for PowerShell scripts to store temporary files, so maybe not suspicious yet. However, the next entry shows a registry value being set by PowerShell. Not sure yet, but I need to check more.\n\nThen there are a few entries with 'None' for process, winlog, and file. Those might be incomplete or error logs, but not necessarily malicious. But then I see entries where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path is 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The path has 'unidade_logico' which might be a Portuguese term for 'logical unit', but that's just a guess. The filename 'componente_auxiliar.ps1' translates to 'auxiliary component.ps1'. The fact that it's executing a remote command could be a red flag, but I need to see more.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries with the same command line for PowerShell. The command line imports a module from the same path mentioned earlier, then tries to invoke 'Invoke-entrada_principal' with OutputDirectory set to the Temp folder. If 'Invoke-entrada_principal' is a custom function, that might be part of a malicious script. Also, the use of 'Start-Sleep 5' is just a delay, but the presence of multiple identical entries could indicate that the script is being executed repeatedly or that there's some automation involved.\n\nThe repetition of the same PowerShell command line across multiple entries might suggest that this is part of a persistent or automated process. Also, the file path 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1' is in a non-standard directory, which could be a sign of a rogue script. The fact that the script is being imported and executed from there might indicate that it's not part of the standard system files.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial .NET image loads are normal, but the PowerShell activity involving executing a remote command from a non-standard path, along with repeated execution of the same script, could indicate a potential security issue. The use of a custom module and the invocation of a function named 'Invoke-entrada_principal' (which doesn't ring a bell as a standard PowerShell cmdlet) might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. But the combination of these factors makes me think this is worth investigating further.

The first thing I notice is that a lot of the events have the same structure. The process is \"None\", which might mean that the event doesn't have a specific process associated with it, or maybe it's a system-level event. The winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is always \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". \n\nNow, PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) are often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but they can also be exploited for malicious purposes. The repetition of the same file path and task might indicate something suspicious. If this script is being executed multiple times, especially if it's from an unusual location, that could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of entries where the task is \"None\" and \"Windows Update Agent\", which are normal activities.
