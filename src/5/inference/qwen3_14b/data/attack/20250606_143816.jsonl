The command uses \"iex\" (Invoke-Expression) with a WebClient downloadstring from a GitHub URL. The URL is from S3cur3Th1sSh1t's WinPwn repository. That's a known malicious GitHub repo, so that's a red flag.

However, the combination of these tasks with the malicious commands is a strong indicator of an attack.\n\nThe confidence here is high because the same malicious PowerShell script is being executed multiple times, and the use of New-PSDrive suggests lateral movement or data access.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event has a process command line that's using PowerShell to create a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems suspicious because creating a drive mapping to a remote machine's C$ share could be part of accessing files remotely, maybe even for malicious purposes. The task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but the command itself is noteworthy.\n\nThen there are 20 other events where the process is None, and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' each time. A lot of repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks might indicate that there's some automated or repeated remote execution happening. However, without more details like the command being executed or the source, it's a bit hard to tell if this is benign or malicious. \n\nBut combining the first event with the others, there's a possibility that someone is setting up a connection to a remote machine (via the PSDrive) and then executing commands remotely. The repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' could be part of a larger attack, like deploying malware or extracting data. However, it's also possible that these are legitimate administrative tasks, especially if the system is part of a network where remote commands are regularly executed.\n\nThe key here is the combination of creating a remote drive and multiple remote command executions. That could be a sign of someone trying to maintain access or perform actions on a remote system. But I need to be careful not to assume malice without more evidence. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or unauthorized access, but the combination of events does raise some red flags.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created. That's common, but not necessarily bad. However, looking at the fifth event, there's a process create for powershell.exe with a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is part of a repository named WinPwn, which sounds suspicious. That's a red flag because downloading and executing scripts from untrusted sources is a common attack vector.\n\nThen, there are several image load events for PowerShell, which is normal, but some of the loaded DLLs are from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That might be okay, but the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll could indicate that the script is interacting with Windows Defender, maybe trying to disable it or something. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's often a sign of malicious activity where the malware writes a temporary file to execute and then deletes it to avoid leaving traces. The file name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a misleading name to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated access to PowerShell processes and the registry value set events. If the script is modifying the registry, that could be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting it all together: the download of a script from a GitHub repo (even if it's public), the creation and deletion of a temp file, and the use of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments all point towards potential malicious activity. The classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence because these are indicators of compromise that security analysts would typically investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including downloading a script from a GitHub repository (WinPwn.ps1), creating\/deleting temporary files, and loading .NET framework DLLs, which are common indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe with a registry value set. That's normal, svchost is a common system process. Not suspicious yet.\n\nSecond: sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache directory. Sppsvc is related to Software Protection Platform, which handles license checks. The file path seems legitimate. Maybe normal activity.\n\nThird: powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used, but being accessed could be part of normal operations. Not sure yet.\n\nFourth: whoami.exe executed. That's a standard command to check user identity. Probably benign.\n\nThen there's a lot of PowerShell events. Let me check the command lines. One of them has \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". Wait, \"unidade_auxiliar\" is Portuguese for \"auxiliary unit\" or \"auxiliary drive\". The command is trying to map a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That might be a red flag. Why would PowerShell be mapping a network drive, especially with a non-English term? Could be an attempt to access a remote system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be part of the system's own processes. However, the suspicious part is the network drive mapping.\n\nAnother event is a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script. Then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script could be part of a malicious activity, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\" which might be a fake name to look benign, but the presence of such a file is suspicious.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's part of a malicious process, that could be a way to exfiltrate data or communicate with another process.\n\nPutting it all together: The suspicious elements are the network drive mapping using a non-English term, the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, and multiple PowerShell activities. These could indicate an attacker trying to execute a script remotely or perform actions on a network share. However, some of these events could be part of legitimate operations, like automated scripts. But the combination of these events, especially the network drive mapping and the temporary script, raises suspicion. The confidence might be around 0.7 or 0.8. I think it's interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including network drive mapping to \\\\Target\\\\C$ (potentially exfiltration), temporary script creation\/deletion, and numerous image loads that may indicate malicious payload execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
