{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first event shows chrome.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path, which seems legitimate. But then there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. A lot of them, like 10 times. That's a lot of registry changes from chrome.exe. Normally, browsers might do some registry stuff, but doing it so many times could be suspicious. Also, there's a file created by powershell.exe named 'registro_auxiliar.txt' which might be a log file, but not sure. Another event is winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file, which is part of its configuration. But the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe stand out. Maybe it's part of a larger attack where the registry is being modified to persist or change behavior. Since there's no obvious malware here, but the high frequency of registry events from chrome.exe could indicate something unusual. I need to check if that's normal. However, without more context, the repeated registry modifications might be a red flag. So the classification is interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious registry modification events by chrome.exe (10 instances) could indicate attempted persistence or configuration changes, though no direct malicious payload is evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's svchost.exe and powershell.exe triggering registry value set events. Then there's cmd.exe running tasklist. Hmm, registry changes can be normal, but when combined with other processes, maybe not. Then, looking at the image loaded events for tasklist.exe. The files mentioned are amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll, and wmiutils.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Wmiutils.dll is related to WMI. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But why are they being loaded by tasklist.exe? Tasklist is a standard tool, but maybe there's something unusual here.\n\nThen there's a file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of setup. But if this is unexpected, it could be a red flag. However, the user hasn't indicated any context about the environment. \n\nLooking at the other entries, there are multiple registry value set events from chrome.exe. Chrome is a common browser, but excessive registry changes might be suspicious. However, Chrome does modify the registry for its own settings. The same with other processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. \n\nNow, considering the combination. The presence of multiple registry changes by various processes, including some legitimate ones, but also the image load events for system DLLs. However, the key point is that the image load events are for legitimate files. The file creation for winlogbeat might be normal if someone is configuring it. \n\nBut wait, the tasklist.exe loading amsi.dll and others—could that be part of a legitimate process? Maybe. However, if tasklist is being used in an unusual way, but the logs don't show any command-line arguments that are suspicious. The only command line I see is for tasklist.exe running 'tasklist', which is normal. \n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple events from chrome.exe with registry changes. But again, Chrome does that. Unless there's a pattern of changes that's not typical, but the logs don't provide enough detail. \n\nSo, putting it all together. The logs show a mix of normal system processes and activities. The image loads are for legitimate DLLs. The registry changes are from common processes. The only potentially odd thing is the file creation for winlogbeat, but without more context, it's hard to say. Since there's no clear indication of malicious activity—no unexpected processes, no unusual file paths, no network connections, etc.—this batch might not be interesting. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned analyzing the entire batch. Are there any combinations that stand out? For example, multiple registry changes by powershell.exe and cmd.exe. However, those are common tools used for administrative tasks. The presence of multiple events might be normal in a busy system. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that there's no clear malicious activity. The events are mostly legitimate system activities. Therefore, the classification is NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence, since there's no obvious threat, but maybe some normal variations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes (e.g., svchost.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe) performing standard operations like registry modifications and loading legitimate system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No suspicious patterns, unexpected processes, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
