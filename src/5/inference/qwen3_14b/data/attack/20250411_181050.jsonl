{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. There are a lot of chrome.exe processes with network connections detected. That's common, maybe normal browsing. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder called componente_auxiliar.txt. Not sure if that's suspicious yet, but maybe. \n\nThen, there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. That could be normal, but maybe if they're modifying specific keys, it could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by SDXHelper.exe, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe that's a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software uses similar names. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location. So that might be okay. \n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably normal. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a configuration file being created. That's expected during setup or updates.\n\nThere are also ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing other processes in a way that's not typical, it could be a sign of something. However, again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the whole batch, the majority of events are from chrome.exe and powershell.exe doing normal things like network connections, file creation, and registry changes. The SDXHelper.exe and winlogbeat.exe events seem legitimate. The only thing that stands out a bit is the powershell.exe creating a file named componente_auxiliar.txt. That name doesn't ring any immediate bells, but maybe in some contexts it could be suspicious. However, without knowing the content or other associated activities, it's hard to classify it as malicious.\n\nOverall, the events don't show clear signs of a security incident. They look like normal user activity and legitimate processes. So, I think the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's a slight anomaly with the file creation, but nothing conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard user activity (chrome.exe network connections, powershell.exe file operations, legitimate registry changes, and winlogbeat configuration). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, browsers often do that. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe used in attacks. Then powershell.exe appears a few times. PowerShell is common but can be abused. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that uses certutil to encode and decode files. Certutil is usually for certificate utilities, but here it's being used to encode calc.exe (a legitimate Windows app) into a temp file and then decode another file. That seems odd. Encoding and decoding files with certutil can be a method to obfuscate malicious payloads. \n\nThen there are multiple entries of certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The file paths have names like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" which might be a red herring, but the use of certutil for decoding could be part of an attack. Also, the command line arguments involve encoding and decoding, which is not typical for normal operations.\n\nAnother point is the presence of rundll32.exe executing a PcaPatchSdbTask from PcaSvc.dll. This might be related to some system update or patching, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll could be part of a legitimate process, but if these are being loaded in an unusual way, it might be suspicious.\n\nThe repeated use of certutil with file encoding and decoding, along with the creation of temporary executable files, raises flags. Also, the command line in cmd.exe uses certutil to encode and decode files, which is a technique sometimes used by malware to avoid detection. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without seeing the specific registry keys, it's hard to be certain. \n\nPutting it all together: the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, creation of temporary executables, and multiple process creations and registry changes could indicate malicious activity. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe are normal, the combination of these events suggests something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potentially hiding malicious payloads), creation of temporary executable files in user directories, and unusual process executions (e.g., rundll32.exe with PcaPatchSdbTask). These patterns are commonly associated with malware operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
