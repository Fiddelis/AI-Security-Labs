{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess rule. That's common, but not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe being created, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there's another powershell.exe event with a command line that's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a file path that looks unusual: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look standard; maybe it's a custom or malicious file.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which might be normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could indicate something is trying to inject code or load additional components.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. That's common in PowerShell, but when combined with other events, it might be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up. The PipeCreated event could be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but again, in context with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the service creation again: New-Service command is used to create a service with a non-standard path. Services are typically managed by the system, so creating one from a user script could be a red flag. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't seem to be a standard service name either.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events for services.exe might indicate changes to the registry, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, if services.exe is involved in creating or modifying services, that could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of a new service with a suspicious path, multiple ImageLoad events for DLLs, and the use of PowerShell to execute commands that modify the system (like creating services) are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination suggests that an attacker might be using PowerShell to install a backdoor or persistent mechanism on the system.\n\nConfidence-wise, there's enough suspicious activity here to warrant further investigation, but it's not definitive proof. The presence of the service creation and the unusual file paths are strong indicators. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious activity: creation of a new service with a non-standard path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), repeated registry modifications, and loading of DLLs from unexpected locations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: services.exe has a registry value set. That's normal, as services.exe is a legitimate Windows process. But then there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs. Wait, tarefa_logico.exe isn't a standard Windows process. The name seems a bit off—maybe a typo or a foreign language? The files it's loading are all .dlls from the .NET framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. Those are legitimate, but the fact that tarefa_logico.exe is loading them might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nBut then, looking at the process name again, \"tarefa_logico.exe\" – \"tarefa\" is Portuguese for \"task\" or \"job\", and \"logico\" is \"logical\". Maybe it's a legitimate application, but it's not commonly known. However, the repeated loading of multiple .NET DLLs could be part of a .NET application running. But why is it loading so many different DLLs? Maybe that's normal for a .NET app, but I should check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, so maybe that's legitimate. But the other entry for powershell.exe has a registry value set. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for services.exe and svchost.exe with registry value sets. Those are normal system processes, so their activity might be routine. However, the sheer number of services.exe entries (like 10 times) might be a red flag. But maybe it's just a lot of registry changes happening, which isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThe other file created is a WindowsUpdate.etl file. That's a system log file, so that's normal too.\n\nNow, the key point here is the presence of tarefa_logico.exe. Since that's not a standard Windows process, and it's loading several .NET DLLs, it might be a legitimate application, but if it's not known or expected on the system, that could be suspicious. However, without more context, like if it's part of a known application or if there are other malicious activities, it's hard to tell. The other events don't show obvious signs of malware, like file deletions, network connections, or unusual registry changes. The PowerShell activities are in expected locations.\n\nBut considering that tarefa_logico.exe is not a common process and is loading multiple .NET components, it might be worth investigating further. The confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the presence of an uncommon process loading system DLLs could indicate something. However, there's not enough evidence to be high confidence. So the classification would be INTERESTING, with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The presence of 'tarefa_logico.exe' (non-standard process name) repeatedly loading .NET framework DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc.) may indicate a legitimate application, but the unusual process name and lack of clear context warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of entries where the process is svchost.exe and the task is \"Registry value set\". svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, if there are multiple registry changes, that could be suspicious. But since svchost is normal, maybe this is just regular system activity. But then again, if there's a lot of it, maybe something's going on. But I need to check other entries too.\n\nThen, there are entries with setup.exe creating files. The files are in the Program Files directory under Microsoft EdgeCore and Edge. Some of the filenames like msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, etc., seem to be legitimate Edge components. However, there's also a setup.exe in the Installer folder, which might be part of a legitimate installation. But wait, setup.exe is the process creating these files. If setup.exe is part of a legitimate Microsoft Edge installation, then this might be normal. However, setup.exe can also be used by malware for installation. But the paths look like they belong to Microsoft Edge, so maybe it's a legitimate install.\n\nAnother point is that there's a RuntimeBroker.exe making a registry change. RuntimeBroker is a normal Windows process related to app permissions, so that's probably okay.\n\nBut here's a thought: if setup.exe is creating a lot of files in the Program Files directory, that could be part of a normal installation, especially if it's Edge. However, the presence of multiple registry changes by svchost.exe might be a red flag. But svchost is a common process, so unless there's something unusual in the registry keys being modified, it might not be malicious.\n\nWait, the justification needs to be concise. Let me see: the batch includes setup.exe creating multiple Edge-related files, which could be part of a legitimate installation. But the repetition of svchost.exe registry changes might be normal. However, if there's no other suspicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. But I need to check if there's anything that's out of the ordinary. The files created are in standard locations for Edge, so maybe it's just an installation. However, setup.exe is a common name for installers, so if it's a legitimate Microsoft installer, then it's okay. But if it's a different setup.exe, that's a problem. The paths here do point to Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate product.\n\nSo putting it all together: the events might be part of a legitimate Microsoft Edge installation, hence not interesting. However, the multiple registry changes by svchost.exe could be a sign of something else. But without more context, like the specific registry keys or other anomalies, it's hard to say. Since the files are in expected locations and the processes are legitimate, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. The confidence might be around 0.6, but maybe slightly higher. Alternatively, if the setup.exe is not from Microsoft, but the path suggests it is. So I think the classification is NOT INTERESTING because it's likely a legitimate installation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events appear to align with legitimate Microsoft Edge installation activity (setup.exe creating expected Edge-related files in standard directories). svchost.exe registry modifications are common for system services and lack malicious indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve svchost.exe and services.exe making changes to the registry. There are a bunch of \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted\" events. Normally, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, and services.exe is part of the Windows operating system. However, excessive or unusual registry modifications could be a red flag. But on their own, these might not be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are entries involving setup.exe. Setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. The logs show that setup.exe is creating files in specific directories. For example, it's creating msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe under the Microsoft Edge Application folder. Also, there are .lnk files created in the Start Menu and Quick Launch areas. \n\nWait, but Microsoft Edge is a legitimate application, and some of these files might be part of its installation. However, the presence of setup.exe creating these files might be part of a legitimate installation. But I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nLooking deeper, the files created are in standard locations like Program Files and Windows System32. The names of the files (msedge_proxy.exe, pwahelper.exe) do seem to be related to Microsoft Edge. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files could be part of a legitimate update or installation. But why are there so many registry changes?\n\nAnother thing to consider: the combination of registry changes by svchost.exe and services.exe along with file creation by setup.exe. If these events are part of a normal system update or software installation, they might not be suspicious. However, if setup.exe is part of a malicious installation, then creating these files could be part of a malware distribution.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't provided any other context, like the source of setup.exe or any other indicators of compromise. Without more information, it's hard to say definitively. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications by system processes and setup.exe creating files in standard locations might not be enough to flag as malicious. \n\nHowever, the sheer number of events could indicate some automated process. But again, that's not necessarily bad. Alternatively, if these events are happening in a short time frame, that might be more concerning. But the logs don't specify timestamps, so I can't assess timing.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that setup.exe is creating .lnk files. These are shortcuts, which are normal, but if they're pointing to malicious locations, that's bad. However, the paths provided are legitimate. The files are in the ProgramData and AppData folders, which are common for user-specific configurations.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key point here is that setup.exe is involved in creating files, but if setup.exe is a legitimate part of the installation, then this is normal. However, if setup.exe is not supposed to be running or is from an unknown source, that's a problem. But the logs don't mention the process's origin or any anomalies in the setup.exe process itself.\n\nPutting it all together: the events are a mix of normal system processes making registry changes and setup.exe creating files in standard locations. Unless there are other indicators (like unexpected parent processes, unusual command-line arguments, or other malicious activities not mentioned here), these might not be suspicious. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations could be part of a legitimate software installation, but it's also possible that it's part of a malicious activity. Since the logs don't provide enough context, maybe the classification is on the lower side of confidence.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to consider the entire batch. The fact that setup.exe is creating files in specific directories related to Microsoft Edge might be part of a legitimate installation. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe could be normal during an installation. Therefore, without more context, it's not clearly malicious. But maybe the system administrator should investigate further, hence classifying it as \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by system processes (svchost.exe, services.exe) and file creation by setup.exe in legitimate directories (e.g., Microsoft Edge application folder) suggest potential installation or configuration activity.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the data.\n\nFirst, most of the events are related to 'setup.exe' performing registry operations. There are multiple entries where 'setup.exe' is setting registry values or modifying registry objects. That's a lot of activity. Now, registry changes can be normal, like during software installation, but if it's happening repeatedly, that might be suspicious. Also, there are a few entries about pipe creation by 'setup.exe'. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but again, if there's a lot of them, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory. The filenames look like APPX followed by some random strings. APPX is related to Windows Store apps, but the fact that svchost.exe is creating so many of these files might be unusual. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating a lot of temporary files, that could be a sign of something going on. Also, one of the files is in 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\AppReadiness\\\\S-1-5-18', which is a system directory. Creating files there might be more concerning.\n\nAnother point is that 'RuntimeBroker.exe' is also involved in a registry value set. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UWP apps, but again, unless it's part of normal operations, this could be a red flag.\n\nPutting this together: multiple registry changes by setup.exe, pipe creation, and svchost.exe creating numerous temp files. The combination of these events could indicate an installation process, but the high volume and the locations (especially system directories) might suggest something malicious. However, without more context, like whether this is during a known installation or if there are other signs of compromise, it's a bit tricky.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The first one is about PowerShell loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems a bit odd because Windows Defender's own files shouldn't be loaded by PowerShell in a way that's suspicious. But maybe it's normal?\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command using DISM to disable Windows Defender. That's a red flag. DISM is a legitimate tool, but disabling Defender could be part of a malicious attempt to remove security features. The command line shows the user is trying to remove the Windows Defender feature. That's suspicious because it's a common technique used by malware to disable security software.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries about Dism.exe detecting executable files in the Temp directory. The Temp folder is a common place for malware to stage files. The fact that Dism is creating and detecting multiple executables here might indicate that something is being installed or executed from there. The files like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc., are part of the Windows Imaging component, but their presence in Temp and being created by Dism could be part of a legitimate update or a malicious payload.\n\nWait, but the initial command was to disable Windows Defender. If Defender is disabled, that could allow malware to operate without detection. The combination of disabling Defender and then creating multiple executable files in Temp might be part of a larger attack. The PowerShell and Dism processes are involved, which are both legitimate, but their use here seems out of context.\n\nThe confidence here isn't 100% because some of these actions could be part of a legitimate system update or maintenance. However, the disabling of Windows Defender followed by the creation of multiple executables in Temp is highly suspicious.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The key here is to look for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several entries with 'powershell.exe' and different tasks like ImageLoaded, FileCreated, PipeCreated, etc. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. \n\nLooking at the files involved. One of the paths is 'C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25050.5-0\\\\MpOAV.dll'. Wait, that's a Windows Defender file. But why is it being loaded multiple times? Maybe that's normal, but it's also listed in another event as 'MpClient.dll' from the same directory. However, another entry has a file created in 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_...' which looks like temporary files. PowerShell creating files in temp could be normal, but sometimes attackers use temp dirs to store malicious scripts.\n\nThen there's a process with command_line that runs a script checking for .inf files with certain patterns. The command is using Get-Content and checking for defaultinstall sections. That might be part of a script that's looking for installation configurations. But why would that be suspicious? Maybe if it's part of a larger malicious payload, but on its own, it's not clear.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated loading of .dll files from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Those are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in unusual contexts or combined with other events, that could be a sign. However, the majority of the events seem to be normal operations, like process creation and file creation.\n\nWait, there's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool for checking user context. But if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that might be a problem. However, in this case, it's just a single process creation.\n\nThe key here is whether there's a combination of events that suggest something malicious. The repeated ImageLoad events for Windows Defender DLLs might be normal, but the presence of multiple FileCreate events in temp directories and the PowerShell script that's scanning for .inf files might indicate something. However, without more context, like unexpected network activity, unusual process trees, or privilege escalation, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the justification needs to be concise. The main points are: PowerShell is involved in multiple events, some file creations in temp, and the script checking .inf files. However, none of the events directly indicate a clear attack vector.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple 'svchost.exe' processes creating files in the WindowsApps directory and AppReadiness folder. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file is created in the WindowsApps folder. Now, svchost.exe is a normal system process, but creating files in the AppReadiness folder might be suspicious. Wait, AppReadiness is part of the Windows system, and creating files there could indicate something's wrong, especially if it's not a standard installation.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if it's modifying critical settings. But svchost.exe is a host process for various system services, so maybe it's just part of normal operations. However, repeated registry changes might be a sign of something else, like a malware trying to persist.\n\nThen there's a RuntimeBroker.exe process setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is usually related to UAC and app permissions, so maybe that's normal. But again, if it's doing this multiple times, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign. But then there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various .dll files, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell, especially when running scripts, but the number of times it's happening here might be a bit high. However, the command line shows a simple Write-Host command, which is harmless. \n\nNow, the EdgeGameAssist.exe file is in the WindowsApps directory. That's a protected folder, and normally, only Microsoft apps should be there. If svchost.exe is creating a file there, that might be unusual. Also, the AppReadiness folder is part of the Windows system, and creating files there could be a sign of something trying to install or modify system components without permission.\n\nBut wait, are these files part of a legitimate update or installation? The EdgeGameAssist.exe might be a legitimate part of Edge's Game Assist feature, but the user needs to check if that's the case. However, the fact that svchost.exe is creating these files could be a red flag because svchost typically doesn't create files in those locations. It's more likely that a service or another process would do that, not svchost itself.\n\nAlso, the repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker could indicate an attempt to change system settings or persist. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

While the specific command here is harmless, the loading of multiple .NET DLLs could be part of a larger script or malicious activity. However, the command line is simple, so maybe it's just a test or a normal operation.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of files in protected system directories by svchost.exe, along with multiple registry changes, might indicate a potential security issue.

However, the Temp directory is often used by malware to store temporary files. The filenames end with .mui, which are usually language-specific resource files. But why are these being flagged as executable?\n\nWait, the rule is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which might be triggered when an executable is created or accessed.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events, they all involve DismHost.exe and Dism.exe. The tasks are about image loading and file deletions.\n\nHmm, the first 13 entries are all about DismHost.exe loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The paths are all in the same Temp folder with a unique GUID. That seems normal for some setup or installation process, maybe part of Windows Imaging or deployment tools. But then, the next few entries show Dism.exe deleting some of those DLLs. \n\nWait, why would Dism.exe delete the files it just loaded? That might be part of a legitimate process, like cleaning up after deployment. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here. The fact that multiple DLLs are loaded and then deleted could indicate something. However, the filenames like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc., seem to be legitimate providers used by DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management). \n\nBut wait, the first entry has IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, DmiProvider.dll, etc. Are these standard providers? Maybe. However, the fact that all these files are in a temporary directory and being loaded by DismHost.exe might be normal during a system image deployment. The deletion by Dism.exe could be part of the process. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any indication of malicious activity. If these DLLs were not supposed to be there, or if they were injected by an attacker, that would be a problem. But the logs don't show any anomalies like unexpected processes or network activity. All events are related to DISM tools. \n\nThe classification depends on whether this is normal behavior. DISM is used for imaging, so loading and deleting providers might be standard. However, the high number of DLLs loaded and then deleted might be a red flag. But without more context, like if the user was performing an imaging task, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided additional context, but the events are all related to legitimate DISM operations, maybe this is not interesting. However, the fact that multiple files are loaded and deleted could be part of a larger attack. But I don't see any clear signs of that here. \n\nConfidence is a bit tricky. If I'm unsure, maybe 0.6. But if I think it's more likely legitimate, then lower. However, since all the files are in the Temp folder and associated with DISM, which is a known tool, I might lean towards NOT INTERESTING. But the high number of events might still raise a flag. \n\nWait, the justification needs to be concise. So, if the events are part of a legitimate DISM process, then NOT INTERESTING. But if there's something suspicious, like unexpected files, then INTERESTING. Since the files are named after providers and the processes are DISM-related, it's probably normal. So, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) operations, including loading and deleting provider DLLs from a temporary directory, which is standard behavior during system image deployment or configuration tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is that I have to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nLooking at the data, all the processes are related to Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The winlog tasks mention \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Image loaded\". The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. The names of the DLLs like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc., seem a bit generic, but maybe that's normal for DISM tools?\n\nWait, DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing Windows images. It's common for DISM to load various providers and DLLs during operations like sysprep or image deployment. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded from the Temp directory might be suspicious. Normally, system tools don't load a lot of DLLs from the Temp folder, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nBut then again, if this is part of a legitimate process, like a system update or image customization, it might be normal. However, the repetition of multiple DLLs being loaded from the same Temp directory could indicate that something is happening here. Also, the presence of DismHost.exe, which is a known component of DISM, but the command line shows a GUID, which might be part of a specific operation. \n\nBut I need to check if these are typical events. For example, when DISM runs, it might generate temporary files and load various DLLs. However, if this is a one-time event, it's normal. But if this is part of a larger pattern, or if there are other suspicious activities not shown here, it could be a red flag. However, based solely on the given data, all the events seem to be related to DISM operations. \n\nWait, but the classification is whether the batch is interesting. The key is that the events are all related to a legitimate process, but the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from Temp might be unusual. However, I'm not sure if that's a sign of malicious activity or just a normal part of DISM's operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of multiple File Executable Detected events for different DLLs in the Temp directory is normal. DISM might be executing these as part of its workflow. However, the Image Load events for those DLLs could be part of the same process. \n\nI think the key here is that all the events are related to a legitimate process (DISM), but the fact that they're all in the Temp directory and involve multiple DLLs might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the user is asking for an analysis, and the events are all related to a known tool, maybe they are not interesting. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, but the rule names are \"FileExecutableDetected\" and \"ImageLoad\". If these are from a security tool's detection rules, maybe the fact that multiple files are being detected as executables in the Temp directory is suspicious. However, DISM does use temporary files during its operations. \n\nHmm. I think the answer here is that the events are not interesting because they are part of a legitimate DISM process. However, I'm a bit uncertain because the Temp directory is often a place for malware. But given that the process is Dism.exe, which is a legitimate tool, and the files are part of its normal operations, the classification might be NOT INTERESTING. However, the confidence might be lower because there's a possibility of something malicious here. \n\nAlternatively, if the user's security system is flagging these as suspicious, but the process is legitimate, maybe it's a false positive. But the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. If all events are part of a normal process, then it's not interesting. But if the combination of events is unusual, maybe it is. \n\nI think I need to conclude that this is NOT INTERESTING because it's related to DISM's normal operations, even though the Temp directory is involved. But the confidence might be around 0.6 because there's some ambiguity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Windows DISM processes loading expected DLLs during system imaging operations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to file deletions logged by the FileDeleteDetected rule, and the process involved is Dism.exe. The files being deleted are all .mui files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. \n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. It's commonly used during system setup, imaging, or deployment processes. The .mui files are language-specific resource files, often used for localization in Windows. \n\nHowever, the fact that so many of these files are being deleted in quick succession might be unusual. Typically, during a normal system deployment or imaging process, Dism.exe might create or modify files, but deleting a large number of .mui files in the Temp directory could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, maybe this is part of a legitimate process. For example, during a sysprep or image capture operation, temporary files are often cleaned up. The Temp directory is a common place for such temporary files. The GUID in the path suggests that this might be part of a specific operation, perhaps a deployment or imaging task that's generating temporary files which are then being deleted.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility of malicious activity. If an attacker were to use Dism.exe to delete files, especially if it's part of a larger attack, but in this case, there's no indication of other malicious activities. The events only show deletions, no creation of suspicious files or network activity. \n\nThe key here is the number of deletions. While a few deletions might be normal, 15 deletions all from the same process and same directory might be more suspicious. However, since Dism.exe is a legitimate tool, and the files are in the Temp directory, which is expected for temporary files, this might not be malicious. \n\nBut the classification depends on whether this is unusual. If the system is undergoing a deployment or imaging process, this is normal. However, if there's no such process happening, this could be an indicator of something else. Since the batch doesn't provide context about other events or processes, it's hard to say. However, the fact that all these deletions are from Dism.exe and in the Temp directory suggests it's part of a legitimate process, even if the number of deletions is high. \n\nTherefore, I think this might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's likely part of a normal system operation, even though the number of events is high.

For example, when you run DISM commands to apply an image or clean up temporary files, it might remove these provider DLLs. The Temp folder is a common place for such temporary files. However, the presence of multiple Provider DLLs being deleted could also indicate that someone is trying to remove evidence, like malicious files that were temporarily placed there. \n\nOn the other hand, if these files were part of a legitimate deployment or imaging process, then this could be normal. The key here is the combination of the process (Dism.exe) and the files being deleted.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a service with a custom executable, especially from a directory that's not typical (like Program Files or System32), is a red flag.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first two entries are about a PowerShell command being executed. The command line looks a bit suspicious. Let me parse it. The PowerShell script is checking for INF files in the Windows directory, specifically looking for sections that match [defaultinstall.nt followed by architecture types like amd64, arm, etc.]. The script sets a result variable based on whether it finds those sections. \n\nHmm, INF files are typically used for installing drivers or hardware configurations. The script is scanning through them, maybe looking for something related to driver installation. But why would someone do that? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like checking for driver compatibility. However, the fact that this is done via PowerShell with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted might be a red flag. Restricted policy usually prevents running scripts unless they're signed or allowed, so if this is a legitimate process, it might be allowed, but if it's malicious, that could be a way to bypass some protections.\n\nWait, the same command appears twice. Maybe it's a repeated action. The task in the winlog is 'Engine Lifecycle' for both. Not sure what that refers to, but maybe it's part of a system process. However, the command itself is scanning INF files for specific sections. Could this be related to checking for malicious INF files? Or maybe it's part of a legitimate diagnostic tool?\n\nThe other entries are less suspicious. The third event has no process and a task related to Security Group Management. The fourth is services.exe during logon, which is normal. The fifth is a Special Logon event with no process. \n\nBut the main thing here is the PowerShell command. The key part is the regex matching [defaultinstall.nt...], which is a section in INF files that's used for driver installation. If this script is looking for those sections, maybe it's trying to determine if there are any driver-related configurations that could be exploited. Alternatively, it could be part of a tool that's checking for existing driver installations. However, the fact that it's being run with Restricted ExecutionPolicy might indicate that the user is trying to run a script that's not normally allowed, which could be a sign of a security bypass attempt.\n\nAnother angle: INF files can be used in malware to install drivers or modify system configurations. If this script is scanning for such sections, maybe it's part of a payload that's checking for the presence of specific drivers or trying to install its own. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the repetition of the same command in two events might indicate that it's being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a larger process.\n\nConsidering all that, the presence of the PowerShell script scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections, combined with the ExecutionPolicy setting, might be worth investigating. It's not definitively malicious, but it's suspicious enough to warrant further examination. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the unusual PowerShell activity scanning INF files which could indicate malicious intent, though not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repeated PowerShell activity scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections (e.g., [defaultinstall.ntamd64]) may indicate reconnaissance for driver manipulation or exploitation, though not definitively malicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and they want me to analyze them. Hmm, looking at the logs, most of them seem to be from Windows events, probably from something like Windows Event Viewer or a security tool. The entries have process names, winlog tasks, and sometimes file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and a command line that includes creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in the \"unidade_logico\" directory. That seems suspicious. Why would someone create a new service with PowerShell? Maybe it's part of a malicious activity, like installing a backdoor or a trojan.\n\nThen there are entries with \"svchost.exe\" and \"services.exe\", which are legitimate system processes. But the registry value set events might be normal, like services being configured. However, the repetition of the PowerShell command multiple times could indicate an attempt to persist the service, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThe file path mentioned, \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\", doesn't look like a standard Windows directory. Typically, system files are in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" or \"C:\\Program Files\". The presence of \"unidade_logico\" (which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese) might be a custom directory, possibly used by an attacker to hide malicious files.\n\nAlso, the \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog might relate to the security software or event logging system. If these are from a security tool, the repeated entries could be part of an alert or detection mechanism. But the fact that the same PowerShell command is logged multiple times could mean the system is trying to detect or respond to the service creation.\n\nI should check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a known malicious file. Maybe it's a typo or a renamed malicious executable. The name \"tarefa_logico\" translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or part of a naming convention used by the attacker.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of the \"New-Service\" cmdlet in PowerShell. This is a legitimate command but is often abused by attackers to create persistent services. The fact that it's being used here without any apparent legitimate context raises a red flag.\n\nThe user might be concerned about potential malware or unauthorized activities on their system. They might want to know if the service creation is malicious, how to check the file's legitimacy, and what steps to take next.\n\nI should also mention that even though some entries are from legitimate processes, the repeated service creation and the non-standard file paths are suspicious. Recommending further investigation, like checking the file's hash against malware databases, analyzing the service's behavior, and ensuring the system is up to date with security patches could be helpful.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a series of system events, including process creation, registry modifications, and the installation of a new service. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and potential concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity**\n- **Event Example:**\n  ```json\n  \"process\": {\n    \"command_line\": \"powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\"\n  }\n  ```\n- **Analysis:**\n  - **`New-Service`** is used to create a new Windows service named `objeto_ativo` (Portuguese for \"active object\") with a binary path pointing to `tarefa_logico.exe` (Portuguese for \"logical task\").\n  - **`Start-Service`** immediately starts the service.\n  - **Red Flags:**\n    - The service is created using PowerShell, which is common in malicious scripts for persistence.\n    - The file path `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is non-standard and likely a custom directory, not part of legitimate Windows operations.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Non-Standard File Location**\n- **Path:** `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`\n- **Analysis:**\n  - This directory structure is not typical for Windows system files or legitimate applications.\n  - The use of Portuguese in filenames may be an attempt to obfuscate or target users in Portuguese-speaking regions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Repeated Events**\n- **Multiple Entries:**\n  - The same PowerShell command is logged repeatedly (7 times), suggesting either:\n    - **A script or loop** attempting to persist the service.\n    - **A detection system** (e.g., SIEM) flagging the activity for further analysis.\n  - **`Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle`** tasks in `winlog` may relate to security tools or monitoring systems.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Legitimate System Processes**\n- **Examples:**\n  - `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe` are standard Windows processes.\n  - **Registry value set** events are normal for service configuration.\n- **However**, the combination of these processes with the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns about **compromise**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Malicious Service Creation:** \n  - The service `objeto_ativo` could be a backdoor or malicious payload.\n- **File Path:** \n  - `tarefa_logico.exe` in a non-standard directory is a strong indicator of a potential threat.\n- **Persistence Mechanism:** \n  - Using PowerShell to create a service is a common tactic in malware for persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Check the File:**\n   - Verify the hash of `tarefa_logico.exe` using tools like **VirusTotal** or **Windows Defender** to determine if it is malicious.\n   - Inspect the file's contents (e.g., using `strings` or a hex editor) for suspicious code.\n\n2. **Investigate the Service:**\n   - Use **`sc query objeto_ativo`** to check the service's details.\n   - Monitor the service's behavior (e.g., network connections, resource usage).\n\n3. **System Scanning:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.\n   - Check for other anomalies in the Windows Event Viewer (e.g., under **Security** or **System** logs).\n\n4. **Network Monitoring:**\n   - Monitor traffic from `tarefa_logico.exe` for C2 (command-and-control) communication or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **Log Analysis:**\n   - Correlate this activity with other logs (e.g., process creation, file modifications) to identify the full scope of the activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest **potentially malicious activity** involving the creation of a non-standard service (`objeto_ativo`) with an executable in a suspicious directory. While some processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`) are legitimate, the PowerShell script and file path are highly indicative of a compromise. Immediate investigation and scanning are recommended to confirm the threat and mitigate risks."}
