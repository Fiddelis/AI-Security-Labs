{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs carefully. The first event is about updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate as part of their update process. Then there's cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which could be normal but might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessing a process, which isn't too unusual. But then there's a command line in a powershell script that's doing several things: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. This looks like someone is enumerating users, groups, and checking credentials. That's a common attack technique to gather information about the system.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events related to Security Group Management and User Account Management, which might be part of the same enumeration. The logs also show SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll, which are standard system files, so that might not be malicious. However, the PowerShell script's command line is a red flag because it's using multiple commands to gather system information, which is typical in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nEven though some processes are legitimate, the combination of PowerShell commands and multiple security-related events suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the processes mentioned. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The command lines in the process entries include commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users', 'get-childitem C:\\Users', 'dir C:\\Users', 'get-localgroup', and 'net localgroup'. These commands are typically used to gather information about users, groups, and system configurations. That's suspicious because such commands could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker trying to map the system.\n\nThen there's a mention of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if it's part of legitimate monitoring. But I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity related to it.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'net1.exe' process with the command line 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1 user'. The 'net1.exe' is not a standard Windows utility; the correct one is 'net.exe'. This could be a typo or a malicious replacement. That's a red flag because it might indicate an attempt to mimic legitimate processes.\n\nAnother point is the 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. Depending on the context, this could be benign, but combined with other activities, it might be part of data exfiltration or leaving behind malicious files.\n\nThere are multiple entries for 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. However, Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much unless there's an extension or malware involved. But since there are eight entries, it's worth noting, though not as immediately suspicious as the PowerShell activities.\n\nThe presence of 'SDXHelper.exe' loading 'combase.dll' and 'updater.exe' creating a pipe might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell commands and the suspicious 'net1.exe'.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands that gather system information, the use of a non-standard 'net1.exe', and the creation of files in user directories are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some entries might be normal, the combination of these events suggests reconnaissance or preparation for further attacks. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands executing sensitive system enumeration tasks (user\/group listings, file system access, credential checks) combined with suspicious process activity (non-standard 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe') and file creation in user directories indicate potential reconnaissance or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious here. But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe activities. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the entries shows a powershell.exe process with a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups. That's a red flag because it could be part of reconnaissance for an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be a sign that something is trying to interact with the antivirus, maybe to disable it or bypass it.\n\nThere's also a File Create and then File Delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and then immediately deleting a script might be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving traces. The script's name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a way to bypass script execution policies, but that's just a guess.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events might not be significant on their own, but combined with the other activities, they could indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some interaction with security software.\n\nPutting this all together, the Chrome activities seem benign, but the PowerShell activities are more concerning. The command line suggests information gathering, the loading of multiple DLLs, and the creation\/deletion of a script could be part of a larger attack. However, I should check if these are typical behaviors. For example, PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but also by legitimate scripts. The presence of multiple registry events and network connections might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The PowerShell activities are suspicious, but without more context, like unusual network destinations or other malicious activities, it's hard to be 100% sure. However, the combination of information gathering commands, loading of potentially malicious DLLs, and script creation\/deletion does raise a red flag. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), loading of potentially malicious DLLs, and temporary script creation\/deletion which may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these events step by step. First, I need to look for any unusual activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nLooking at the first event, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs, so this might be normal. However, the same file is mentioned again in another event, which could be a red flag if it's being modified multiple times, but the task here is FileCreate, so maybe it's just a regular setup.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process, and urlmon.dll is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded by an unknown process, that could be suspicious. However, I should check if SDXHelper is part of any known software. Maybe it's a legitimate helper tool, but I'm not sure. This might need more context.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating a file isn't inherently bad, but the name modulo_base.txt doesn't ring any bells. Maybe it's part of a script or a benign operation.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process is being run with the installsource scheduler. This might be a scheduled update, which is normal. However, sometimes malware uses similar names. The command line here seems to be a legitimate update command, so maybe it's okay.\n\nThere are two svchost.exe entries with Registry value set events. svchost.exe is a standard Windows process that hosts multiple services. Registry changes could be normal, but if they're related to malicious configuration, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe event loading taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, which is legitimate. However, if this is happening in an unusual context, like from a non-standard location or by a suspicious process, it could be a concern. But again, if the process is legitimate, it might be normal.\n\nThe backgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll again. BackgroundTaskHost is part of Windows, so this might be normal. However, repeated loading of the same DLL by different processes could be a sign of something, but I'm not certain.\n\nThe last two entries are about PowerShell accessing the registry and a process access event. PowerShell interacting with the registry could be part of a script, which is normal, but if it's modifying critical keys, that's a problem. The ProcessAccess event might indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which could be a sign of compromise, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, there are a few suspicious points: SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, multiple registry changes by svchost and PowerShell, and the presence of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe. However, many of these could be legitimate. The repetition of file creation by winlogbeat and the same DLLs being loaded might not be enough to classify this as interesting. I need to check if there's a pattern or multiple events pointing to the same issue. Since there's no clear indication of malicious activity like unexpected network traffic, privilege escalation, or known malicious files, the confidence is low. So, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the multiple events with the same file creation by winlogbeat are normal. I think the answer is not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily reflect standard system activities (e.g., file creation by winlogbeat.exe, legitimate DLL loading, scheduled updates). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns observed across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
