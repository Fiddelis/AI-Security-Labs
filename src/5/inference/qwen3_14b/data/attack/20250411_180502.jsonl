{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll look through the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe activities. Let me check those.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe executing a command to start a process with a long path: \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" might be a red flag because it could indicate trying to access parent directories, maybe to obfuscate the path. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of multiple image loads could be part of legitimate operations or maybe something else.\n\nThen there's a FileCreated and FileDeleted event for a temporary script file. That's common in PowerShell scripts, but if the file is created and then immediately deleted, it might be part of a malicious script trying to hide its tracks. Also, the PipeCreated event might be used for inter-process communication, which could be benign but sometimes used in attacks.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is starting processes with paths that have \"..\\\". This might be an attempt to bypass path-based defenses or make the path less obvious. Also, the fact that there are multiple such commands with different paths could indicate automated or script-based activities.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe event is about a registry value set, which might not be too concerning on its own. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious paths, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and using '..' in paths. These could be signs of a malicious script or attack, especially if the scripts are executing commands that are not typically done by a user. However, some of these activities could be legitimate, like running batch files as part of normal operations. But the combination of several suspicious elements makes me think this is worth investigating further.\n\nSo, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple PowerShell activities with potentially obfuscated paths, temporary file creation\/deletion, and image loads that might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, it's not conclusive without more context, but the presence of these factors together raises a red flag.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious patterns, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity with Obfuscated Paths**:\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing commands with paths containing `..\\` (e.g., `C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\pacote_secundario\\objeto_padrao_script.bat`). This could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the true path, a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. While this is common in legitimate PowerShell operations, the pattern may also be used by malware to execute payloads in memory and avoid leaving traces on disk.\n\n3. **Frequent Image Loads and DLLs**:\n   - PowerShell loads several system DLLs (e.g., from `.NET`, `Windows Defender`, `PipeEvent`). While normal, the volume of such events could indicate an automated or scripted process, potentially malicious.\n\n4. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**:\n   - Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events with `Start-Process` commands suggest automated execution of batch scripts (`*.bat`). This could be part of a larger attack chain (e.g., executing payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data).\n\n5. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and `powershell.exe` modify registry values. While registry changes are common, they may be part of persistence mechanisms if linked to other suspicious activities.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**:\n- **Suspicious Indicators**: \n  - Obfuscated paths, temporary file handling, and repeated `Start-Process` commands with batch files.\n  - The combination of PowerShell activities and registry modifications could hint at lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n- **Legitimate Possibilities**:\n  - Normal system operations (e.g., script execution, updates, or application interactions).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**:\n- **Investigate Further**: Correlate these logs with other system data (e.g., network traffic, user activity, file integrity checks) to determine if the PowerShell scripts are benign or malicious.\n- **Check for Anomalies**: Look for unexpected batch files, unusual network connections, or unauthorized user accounts associated with the activities.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage**: Implement logging and alerting for PowerShell commands with obfuscated paths or high-risk operations (e.g., `Start-Process`, `Invoke-Expression`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe log entries **qualify as \"INTERESTING\"** due to the presence of multiple suspicious patterns (obfuscated paths, temporary file creation, and repeated script execution) that could indicate a potential security threat. Further analysis is required to confirm benignity or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a lot of entries related to Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe. Let me check what's happening with them. \n\nStarting with the first few lines: Calculator.exe and PowerShell.exe are setting registry values. Then, PowerShell.exe has a process accessed event. Then, there's an image loaded for MpClient.dll. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a command line for PowerShell that starts a process with a path that has \"..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" might indicate moving up a directory, which could be suspicious if it's trying to access files outside the intended directory. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that runs a script from \"C:\\entrada_ativo\\estrutura_principal\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". The path here is a bit generic, but maybe that's part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe might be noteworthy. \n\nAnother point is the file creation by PowerShell.exe at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt\". Creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a red flag. Also, the svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory might be normal, but I need to check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nWait, there's also an image loaded for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are related to antivirus and security features. If they're being loaded normally, that's fine. But if there's any unexpected loading, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't indicate any errors here.\n\nThe command line for the PowerShell process has a script path that seems to be in a directory structure that's not very specific. Maybe that's a sign of a script being executed from a non-standard location. Also, the use of \"Start-Process\" with a path that has multiple dots might be an attempt to bypass security measures, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnother thing is the repetition of registry value sets by Chrome.exe. If Chrome is modifying its own registry keys, that's normal. But if it's modifying other keys or doing it excessively, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so I can't be certain.\n\nPutting this all together, the main suspicious points are the PowerShell command line with the script path using relative paths, and the creation of files in user directories. However, without more context on the specific registry keys or the content of the scripts, it's hard to be certain. But since there are multiple events that could indicate potential malicious activity, like unusual file creation and registry modifications, I think this batch of logs is worth investigating further. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain several activities that could indicate potential security concerns, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **Unusual Script Execution Paths**:\n   - A PowerShell process executes a script with a path containing `..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat`. The use of relative paths (`..`) may suggest an attempt to access files outside the expected directory structure, potentially bypassing security controls or executing unauthorized scripts.\n\n2. **File Creation in User Directories**:\n   - PowerShell creates a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt`. While file creation in the Downloads folder is not inherently malicious, it could be part of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms if linked to other suspicious activities.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple entries involve Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe modifying registry values. While registry changes are normal for software operations, the high frequency and lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) raise questions about legitimacy.\n\n4. **Image Load Events for Security-Related DLLs**:\n   - Chrome.exe loads `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender Antimalware Platform) and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus). While these are legitimate, unexpected or repeated loading could indicate evasion techniques or tampering.\n\n### Justification:\nThe combination of unusual script paths, file creation in user directories, and repetitive registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity. However, without additional context (e.g., specific registry keys, script contents, or correlation with known threats), these events remain inconclusive but warrant further analysis.\n\n### Confidence:\n**0.65** (Moderate concern due to multiple suspicious patterns, though no definitive evidence of malicious intent).\n\n### Classification:\n**INTERESTING**  \n*Reason*: The logs contain activities that could indicate potential security threats, requiring deeper investigation to rule out malicious behavior."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification has to be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each line. The first seven entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. That's a lot of repeated events. Now, chrome.exe is a common process, but modifying the registry could be suspicious. However, if it's just setting values, maybe it's part of normal operations, like updates or extensions. But repeating the same event seven times might indicate something automated or maybe a script running multiple times. Still, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThen there's the eighth entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, part of the Elastic stack. Creating a configuration file (.yml.new) in the Downloads directory might be normal if the user is setting up the tool. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which is less secure than a dedicated config directory. However, this could be a legitimate action if the user is manually configuring it.\n\nThe ninth entry is powershell.exe creating a file named elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating a text file isn't inherently bad, but the name is generic. If this is part of a script that's downloading or executing something else, that's a red flag. However, on its own, it's not suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. The majority of events are from chrome.exe modifying the registry repeatedly. That's unusual. Typically, registry changes by a browser might be related to settings or extensions, but multiple instances could indicate a worm or a script that's propagating. However, the other events don't show any obvious malicious activity. The winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate, and the powershell event is too generic.\n\nBut wait, the confidence level needs to be based on the entire batch. The repetition of the same event seven times by chrome.exe is a bit concerning. Maybe it's a sign of a malicious process trying to modify the registry multiple times to persist or alter system behavior. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or other processes involved, it's a bit hard to be certain. The presence of winlogbeat and powershell isn't necessarily bad, but combined with the repeated chrome events, it might be worth investigating further. \n\nSo, the justification would be that the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could be indicative of suspicious behavior, even though the other events are normal. The confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 0.6, because while the repetition is a flag, it's not definitive without more data. Therefore, the classification is INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modification events by chrome.exe (7 instances) could indicate automated or anomalous behavior, though no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Additional file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe are contextually neutral but warrant correlation with other indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
