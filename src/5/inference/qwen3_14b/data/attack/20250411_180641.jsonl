{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple instances of chrome.exe with network connections. That's normal, as Chrome often connects to the internet. But then there's powershell.exe and process access events. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so that's a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually benign but can be part of reconnaissance. Then, more PowerShell and registry events. The cmd.exe entry stands out because it's invoking csc.exe (C# compiler) with a command line that includes compiling a .cs file into an executable and then running another exe from the temp directory. That seems suspicious because compiling code on the fly, especially from temporary directories, is often seen in malware.\n\nNext, there's the creation of files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The FileExecutableDetected event for unidade_padrao.exe might be a malicious file. Then, several image load events for executables like estrutura_ativo.exe and modulo_secundario.exe, which could indicate that malicious code is being loaded into memory. \n\nThe presence of .NET Framework components and the use of csc.exe to compile code suggests possible code injection or execution of malicious payloads. The termination of elemento_ativo.exe might be an attempt to clean up after the malicious activity. \n\nAlso, multiple Registry value set events could indicate changes to the system's registry, which is a common technique used by malware to persist or alter system behavior. \n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of suspicious process creation, file creation in temp directories, use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for potentially malicious tasks, and image loading that might be part of a larger attack. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome's network connections), the combination of these activities points towards potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: compilation of code using csc.exe in temporary directories, execution of generated executables (e.g., 'registro_padrao.exe'), frequent process access\/registry modifications, and loading of potentially malicious DLLs. These patterns suggest possible malware execution or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are multiple entries with svchost.exe and chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's common in normal system operations, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's the Calculator.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but sometimes malicious software might use similar names or paths. However, in this case, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location. So that might not be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in the data directory might be normal. However, the file name is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be part of a normal setup process, but maybe there's something off here. But I don't see any obvious malicious activity here.\n\nLooking for unusual patterns: multiple chrome.exe entries with registry changes. Chrome is a common application, and registry changes can be part of normal updates or user settings. The ImageLoad events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are also legitimate; those are part of Windows Defender. \n\nWait, but there's a mix of processes. The first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is normal, but then there's Calculator.exe (different casing?) doing a registry set. However, Calculator.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Wait, no, the standard is calc.exe. Maybe that's a typo or a different executable. But the name is capitalized as Calculator.exe, which might be a red flag. However, the JSON parsing might have issues here. For example, the process name might be incorrectly formatted. \n\nAlso, the file paths for the ImageLoad events are legitimate. The svchost.exe events are common, but repeated registry value sets might be part of normal operations. However, if there's a high volume of such events, it could be a sign of something else. But in this batch, there are only a few instances. \n\nThe winlogbeat events are creating a file, which is part of its normal operation. The presence of winlogbeat is probably a legitimate tool. \n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system processes and legitimate file operations. There's no indication of unusual file paths, unexpected processes, or suspicious registry changes that would point to a security threat. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and standard operations (registry updates, image loading of valid system DLLs). No suspicious file paths, unexpected process names, or anomalous behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
