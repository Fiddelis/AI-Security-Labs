{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: updater.exe creating a pipe. That's part of normal operations, maybe for communication between processes. The command line for updater.exe seems legitimate, related to Google's crash handler. The URL points to a known Google endpoint, so that's probably okay.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe processes created with different parameters. Those are common system processes, so unless there's something unusual in the command line, they might be normal. The services.exe logon is standard too.\n\nLooking at the network connections, chrome.exe is making multiple network connections. That's normal for a browser. However, there are also registry value sets by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag if done by unexpected processes. But chrome.exe is a legitimate application, so maybe it's just updating its settings.\n\nThere's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path seems normal. Another file created in WindowsUpdate logs, which is typical during updates. However, the repetition of WindowsUpdate.etl files might be normal, but I should check if there's an unusual number or if they're being created in an unexpected location.\n\nThe image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are part of Windows Defender, so that's legitimate. Explorer.EXE modifying the registry is normal as well.\n\nWait, there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe, especially registry changes and network connections. But since chrome is a common application, unless there's something like unexpected URLs or unusual commands, it might not be malicious. The updater.exe seems to be part of Google's update process, which is legitimate.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a sign of something trying to alter system settings. But again, chrome does use the registry for various purposes. Without more context, it's hard to tell. The logs don't show any obvious malicious indicators like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or connections to known bad domains.\n\nOverall, the events seem to be part of normal system and application behavior. No clear signs of malware or suspicious activity. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. The confidence is around 0.6 because while there's a lot of activity, nothing stands out as malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system and application behavior, including legitimate processes (e.g., svchost.exe, chrome.exe), standard logon activities, and expected file creation\/registry modifications. No malicious indicators or anomalous patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this log data. The user provided a series of events, mostly from MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and some other processes like winlogbeat.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. The main task here is to analyze these logs for any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event step by step. The first entry is about MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a process. The command line includes a long string that looks like a base64 encoded payload. That's a red flag. Malware often uses encoded data to avoid detection. I should note that and check if the decoded payload makes sense or if it's something malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe accessing the process and loading images. The repeated process termination and network connection events might be part of the malware's behavior, trying to establish a connection to a C2 server. The network connection event is significant because it could indicate communication with an external server.\n\nThen, there's a file creation event for a WindowsUpdate.etl file. ETL files are system event trace logs. If these files are being created in the Windows Logs directory, it's normal for system updates, but if they're created by a process like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, it might be part of an attack. However, the presence of multiple ETL files might just be normal system activity unless there's an unusual number or size.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe process is also present. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and shipping logs. However, if it's being run from a user's Downloads folder, that's not typical. Usually, it's installed in the Program Files directory. This could be a sign that the user manually ran it, but it's also possible that it's being used by an attacker to exfiltrate data. The log file created by winlogbeat might be normal, but again, the location and the context matter.\n\nThere's a PowerShell process with a ProcessAccess event. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. The presence of PowerShell alone isn't suspicious unless it's executing unexpected commands or scripts.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe event involves a registry value set. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process that handles app permissions. However, if it's modifying registry keys related to security or system settings, that could be a concern. But the log doesn't specify which registry key was changed, so more information would be needed here.\n\nLooking at the overall sequence, the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe seems to be the main actor here. The encoded payload in its command line is highly suspicious. The repeated process terminations and network connections might be part of a multi-stage attack, where the malware is trying to establish persistence or communicate with a C2 server. The ETL files could be a way to log system activity or exfiltrate data.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events might be part of legitimate software updates. Microsoft Edge and Windows Update processes are common, but the presence of encoded data and unusual network activity still raises concerns. The key is to cross-reference these events with known good behavior. If MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is not part of a legitimate update process, that's a problem.\n\nAnother point is the winlogbeat.exe being run from the Downloads folder. If the user is not aware of running this tool, it could be a sign of a compromise. The ndjson log file might be used to collect system data, which is why the attacker is using winlogbeat. However, without seeing the actual data being written, it's hard to confirm.\n\nIn summary, the main red flags are the encoded payload in MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe's command line, the network connection attempts, and the presence of winlogbeat.exe from an unexpected location. Further investigation would involve checking the decoded payload, analyzing the network traffic, and verifying the legitimacy of the processes involved.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious indicators that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious Activity from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**\n- **Encoded Payload in Command Line**:  \n  The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process has a command line that includes a **base64-encoded string** (`\"&xuot;r45y1+k2Tg\/...\"`). This is highly suspicious, as malware often uses encoded data to evade detection.  \n  - **Example**:  \n    ```bash\n    \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\" \"&xuot;r45y1+k2Tg\/...&quot;\"\n    ```\n  - **Action Required**: Decode the payload to check for malicious content (e.g., PowerShell scripts, payloads, or exfiltration commands).\n\n- **Repeated Process Access and Image Loads**:  \n  Multiple entries show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` accessing its own process and loading images (e.g., `msedgeupdate.exe` and `msedgeupdate.dll`). This could indicate **self-modifying behavior** or **attempts to inject malicious code**.\n\n- **Network Connection Attempts**:  \n  The process attempts to establish a network connection. This is a strong indicator of **C2 (Command and Control) communication** or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Anomalous File Creation: `WindowsUpdate.etl`**\n- **ETL Files (Event Trace Logs)**:  \n  The creation of `WindowsUpdate.etl` in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs` directory is **normal for Windows updates**, but:\n  - **Unusual Context**: If this file is created by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` (instead of `Windows Update` services), it could be a **malware artifact**.\n  - **Action Required**: Check the file's metadata (e.g., timestamps, size) and use tools like **LogParser** or **Wireshark** to analyze its contents for anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **3. `winlogbeat.exe` in Unusual Location**\n- **Legitimate Tool Misused**:  \n  `winlogbeat.exe` is a **legitimate log shipper** (part of Elastic Stack), but its presence in the **`Downloads` directory** is **unusual**.  \n  - **Indicators**:  \n    - The log file `winlogbeat-20231005123456.ndjson` is created in the same directory.  \n    - This could indicate **data exfiltration** if the tool is being used to ship sensitive logs to an external server.  \n  - **Action Required**:  \n    - Verify if `winlogbeat.exe` is part of a **legitimate installation** (e.g., in `C:\\Program Files\\Elastic\\Winlogbeat`).  \n    - Check for **unauthorized configurations** in `winlogbeat.yml` (e.g., outputs pointing to external IPs).\n\n---\n\n### **4. `RuntimeBroker.exe` and Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry Changes**:  \n  The `RuntimeBroker.exe` process modifies a registry key (not specified in the log).  \n  - **Risk**: If the registry change involves **security-related keys** (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options`), it could be an **attempt to bypass security mechanisms**.  \n  - **Action Required**: Audit the registry for unauthorized changes using tools like **Process Monitor** or **Registry Viewer**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. PowerShell Activity**\n- **Process Access Event**:  \n  A `PowerShell.exe` process is logged with a `ProcessAccess` event.  \n  - **Risk**: PowerShell is often used by attackers for **remote code execution** or **script-based attacks**.  \n  - **Action Required**: Check the PowerShell command history (e.g., via `Get-History` or event logs) for suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or `Start-Process` with unknown URLs).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Summary of Findings**\n| **Indicator**                     | **Risk Level** | **Recommendation**                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Encoded payload in `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` | High          | Decode the payload and analyze for malicious content.                              |\n| Network connection by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` | High          | Monitor network traffic for C2 communication or data exfiltration.                |\n| `winlogbeat.exe` in `Downloads` directory | Medium        | Verify if the tool is legitimate and check its configuration.                    |\n| Registry changes by `RuntimeBroker.exe`     | Medium        | Audit registry modifications for unauthorized changes.                            |\n| PowerShell activity                  | Medium        | Check PowerShell history for malicious commands.                                  |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Decode the base64 payload** from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to identify its true purpose.  \n2. **Analyze network traffic** for connections to suspicious IPs or domains.  \n3. **Verify the legitimacy of `winlogbeat.exe`** and its configuration.  \n4. **Audit registry changes** and system logs for unauthorized activity.  \n5. **Isolate affected systems** if malicious activity is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `WindowsUpdate.etl` file creation) may be legitimate, the **encoded payload**, **network connections**, and **unusual tool usage** strongly suggest a potential **malware infection** or **compromise**. Immediate investigation is recommended to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and they probably want me to analyze them. Hmm, these look like Windows event logs, maybe from something like Winlogbeat or another SIEM tool. Each entry has a process name, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on here. Let me go through each entry one by one. The first one is about svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization cache. That's normal for Windows Update, right? Delivery Optimization uses svchost to manage file downloads. So that's probably just part of the update process.\n\nNext, another svchost.exe entry creating content.phf in the same cache directory. Again, that's likely part of the same update process. The file might be a temporary file used during the optimization process. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's Explorer.EXE setting a registry value. That's common for user actions, like changing settings or installing software. Without more context, hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nNotepad.exe is launched with a command line. That's a normal application, but sometimes malware uses notepad as a dropper. However, just opening notepad isn't necessarily bad. Need to check if there's any unusual activity around it.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file in Program Files. That's part of the Edge update process. The file name looks like a legitimate installer. But the next entry shows the same process deleting a temporary file in the user's Temp directory. That's standard for installers to clean up after themselves.\n\nThen, the setup.exe from the Edge installer creating a file in the EdgeUpdate Install directory. That seems normal. However, the next entry shows the creation time of that setup.exe being changed. Changing file timestamps could be a sign of tampering, but it's also possible that the installer is just modifying the file as part of its process.\n\nThe Pipe Created event for setup.exe might be part of communication between processes during installation. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, so that's not unusual.\n\nThe WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl file is an ETL trace log, which is used by Windows for performance monitoring. The presence of such a file might be normal if an update was running, but sometimes malicious software can create ETL files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe last entry is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this is likely part of its configuration process. The .new file suggests it's a temporary configuration file being written, which is normal during setup or updates.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The setup.exe changing the file creation time could be a red flag. Also, the ETL file might be something to check if there's any unexpected activity. However, the majority of these events seem to be related to legitimate processes like updates and installations.\n\nI should also consider the timestamps. The ETL file is from 2025, but the current year is 2023. Wait, that's a problem. The date in the ETL file is April 18, 2025, which is in the future. That's definitely a sign of something wrong. Maybe a log file was generated with a future timestamp, which could be a result of a bug or a malicious attempt to manipulate logs. That's a suspicious point.\n\nAnother thing is the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file with a long path and then deleting a temporary one. The path includes a GUID, which is common in Windows for temporary files, so that's normal. But the future timestamp on the ETL file is definitely odd.\n\nI should also check if there are any other events that might indicate malicious activity. The registry value set by Explorer.EXE could be benign, but without knowing what the value is, it's hard to tell. If the user has access to the actual registry changes, that would help.\n\nIn summary, the main concerns are the future timestamp on the ETL file and the setup.exe changing the file creation time. The rest of the events seem to be part of normal system operations like updates and installations. The user should investigate the ETL file's origin and verify if the timestamps are accurate. Also, checking the setup.exe's integrity and ensuring that the Edge update is legitimate would be good steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided appear to be system events related to process creation, file operations, and registry changes. Here's a breakdown of the key activities and potential concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate System Activity**\n- **`svchost.exe` and `DeliveryOptimization` Cache Files**  \n  - **Activity**: `svchost.exe` creates files in `C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization`.  \n  - **Analysis**: This is **normal behavior** for Windows Update\/Delivery Optimization, which uses `svchost` to manage file caching and peer-to-peer downloads.  \n  - **File**: `content.phf` is likely a temporary file used during the optimization process.\n\n- **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and Installer Files**  \n  - **Activity**:  \n    - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` creates a file in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate` (part of the Edge update process).  \n    - A temporary file in the user's `Temp` directory is deleted.  \n  - **Analysis**: This is **expected during software installation\/update**, where temporary files are created and later cleaned up.\n\n- **`setup.exe` and File Timestamp Modification**  \n  - **Activity**: `setup.exe` modifies the **creation time** of a file in the EdgeUpdate directory.  \n  - **Analysis**: While changing timestamps can be **normal** (e.g., during file operations), it may also be a **red flag** if done maliciously (e.g., to hide the origin of a file). Further investigation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n- **Future-Timestamped ETL File**  \n  - **File**: `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl` (timestamp: **April 18, 2025**).  \n  - **Analysis**:  \n    - **This is highly unusual**. ETL files are performance logs, and a timestamp in the **future** could indicate:  \n      - A **bug or misconfiguration** in the logging system.  \n      - **Malicious activity** (e.g., tampering with logs to hide timestamps).  \n    - **Action**: Verify the system clock and check for unauthorized software that might generate logs. Investigate the source of the ETL file.\n\n- **Registry Change by `Explorer.EXE`**  \n  - **Activity**: A registry value is modified by `Explorer.EXE`.  \n  - **Analysis**: Without knowing the specific registry key or value, this is **hard to assess**. However, **Explorer.EXE** is a legitimate process, and registry changes can be part of normal user activity (e.g., installing software).  \n  - **Action**: Review the registry change details (e.g., key path, value data) for anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Winlogbeat Configuration File**  \n- **File**: `.yml.new` in the Winlogbeat configuration directory.  \n- **Analysis**: This is **normal behavior** during configuration updates or setups. Winlogbeat often creates temporary `.new` files before applying changes.  \n- **Action**: Ensure the file is part of a legitimate Winlogbeat update or configuration change.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Future-Timestamped ETL File**:  \n   - Check system logs for errors or warnings around the time the file was created.  \n   - Verify the integrity of the file using tools like `Get-FileHash` (PowerShell) or antivirus scans.\n\n2. **Monitor `setup.exe` and File Timestamp Changes**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** (Sysinternals) to track file operations and ensure no unauthorized changes are occurring.  \n   - Check the **digital signature** of `setup.exe` to confirm it's a legitimate installer.\n\n3. **Review Registry Changes**:  \n   - Use **Event Viewer** to trace the registry modification and identify the exact key\/value changed.  \n   - Look for any unexpected or unauthorized changes.\n\n4. **Check for Malware**:  \n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools.  \n   - Use **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to detect any malicious activity.\n\n5. **Verify System Clock and Time Synchronization**:  \n   - Ensure the system clock is accurate and synchronized with a reliable time server. A misconfigured clock could explain the future timestamp.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nMost activities are **legitimate system behavior** related to updates and installations. However, the **future-timestamped ETL file** and **file timestamp modification** warrant further investigation. If these anomalies persist, they could indicate a **misconfiguration**, **malware**, or **log tampering**."}
