{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's part of the winlogbeat installation, maybe a configuration file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, powershell.exe created a file called teste.ps1 in the same Downloads folder. That's a PowerShell script. Now, creating a script isn't necessarily bad, but it's something to note.\n\nThen, there's another event from winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file again. Maybe it's just part of the setup process. But then, the next events involve powershell.exe doing various things. There's a registry value set, which could be normal or could be part of some configuration change.\n\nThe command line for powershell.exe shows it's running with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and executing the teste.ps1 script. Bypassing execution policy is a red flag because it allows scripts to run without restrictions, which attackers often do.\n\nThen there are multiple image loaded events for PowerShell, loading .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but when combined with other actions, it might indicate something. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded could be a sign that Defender is active, which is good, but maybe the script is trying to bypass it?\n\nThen, PowerShell creates a temporary script file in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for scripts to generate temporary files. But then it deletes that file. Deleting after creation might be an attempt to cover tracks, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother file is created in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That could be related to setting up a startup script, which might be malicious if it's configured without user knowledge.\n\nThere's also an event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" task. That's a clear indicator of potential remote code execution, which is a serious security issue. Even if it's part of a legitimate process, the presence of this task should be investigated.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating and deleting temporary files, bypassing execution policies, and executing a remote command suggests possible malicious activity. The fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple suspicious actions, along with the remote command execution, raises the confidence level. However, some events could be part of normal operations, like installing software or running legitimate scripts. But the presence of the remote command execution and the bypassed policy makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing a script with bypassed execution policy, creation\/deletion of temporary files, and a remote command execution event. These patterns are commonly associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's probably normal, like installing software. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE set registry values. Those are legitimate processes, maybe configuring something. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is started multiple times. The command line shows it's running from the usual location. Then there are image loads for various DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell.\n\nThen there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file might be part of a test or policy check. But why is it being deleted immediately? Maybe a temporary file, but could be part of malicious activity if it's executing something.\n\nThen a pipe is created, which is common for inter-process communication. Not necessarily bad.\n\nThere are several entries about Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle, which are part of PowerShell's normal operations. Also, loading Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's normal if Defender is running, but maybe if it's being used for something else?\n\nWait, the file created and deleted in Temp might be a red flag. But the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like a legitimate test by PowerShell to check script policies. However, if the script was malicious, it could be a sign. But without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be suspicious. But maybe it's just a temporary file from a legitimate process.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell processes, loading .NET components, registry changes. But all the processes are from expected locations. No network activity mentioned, no unusual file paths. The only odd thing is the temporary script file. But without more context, like the script's content or other events, it's hard to say. However, the presence of such a file could be a sign of a script being executed, which might be benign or malicious.\n\nConsidering the classification, maybe it's not interesting because there's no clear malicious activity. The events are mostly normal system operations. The temporary file might be part of a legitimate process. Unless there's more evidence, like the script being executed with elevated privileges or other anomalies, but that's not present here. So I think the classification is NOT INTERESTING. Confidence around 0.4 because there's a slight anomaly but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show standard system activity including PowerShell operations, .NET component loading, and temporary file creation\/deletion. No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
