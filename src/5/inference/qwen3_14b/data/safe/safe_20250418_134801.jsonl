{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first two entries: Microsoft Edge is creating and modifying a setup.exe file in the EdgeUpdate directory. That seems normal for an update process. But then there's CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. Loading those might be normal, but sometimes malware can inject into these processes. However, just loading them isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event for setup.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. Then there are multiple User Account Management events. A lot of them—like 12 entries. That's a lot. Maybe a script is running that's modifying user accounts repeatedly, which could be a sign of something like account creation or privilege escalation. But I need to check if these are part of a legitimate process.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe command that's checking INF files for certain patterns. The command is looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files, which might be related to driver installation or system updates. The execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default, so that's normal. But why is this being run? Maybe part of a system check or update process.\n\nThen, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its normal operation. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of someone trying to configure or tamper with the log shipping setup.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries with registry value sets could be part of normal service operations, but if there's a lot of them, it might indicate changes to the registry that could be part of a configuration change or malware persistence.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as urlmon is part of Internet Explorer and used for handling URLs. Not suspicious here.\n\nNow, the repeated User Account Management events. If there are multiple entries, maybe a script is modifying user accounts, which could be a red flag. But without more context, like changes to specific accounts or permissions, it's hard to say. However, the sheer number of these events might be worth investigating.\n\nAlso, the setup.exe from EdgeUpdate might be part of a legitimate update, but if there are other suspicious activities around it, like unexpected network connections or file modifications, that could be a problem. But in the given logs, the only related events are the file creation and modification.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat, which is a tool used for monitoring and logging. If this is part of a legitimate monitoring setup, then it's fine. But if it's unexpected, maybe someone is trying to set up a backdoor or monitor activities.\n\nOverall, the most suspicious parts are the numerous User Account Management events and the setup.exe activities. However, without more context or additional indicators of compromise (like unexpected network traffic, unusual process behavior, or unauthorized access), it's a bit hard to determine if this is malicious. But given that there are multiple events that could be part of legitimate processes, but also some that might be worth checking, I'd lean towards this being a potential candidate for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and a few potentially suspicious events that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal\/Legitimate Activities**\n1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:\n   - File creation\/modification of `setup.exe` in the `EdgeUpdate` directory aligns with typical update processes.\n\n2. **Defender-Related DLL Loads**:\n   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components) is standard for threat detection and scanning.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file is consistent with log shippers configuring their settings.\n\n4. **PowerShell Script**:\n   - The script scanning INF files for `[defaultinstall.nt...]` sections appears to be a system check (e.g., detecting driver installation patterns), though its purpose could be unclear without context.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Events**\n1. **Repetitive User Account Management Events**:\n   - **12 identical \"User Account Management\" events** (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` or `svchost.exe` triggering these) could indicate:\n     - **Automated account modification** (e.g., privilege escalation, password changes, or account creation).\n     - **Script-based enumeration** of user accounts, possibly for reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n   - **Risk**: This is a red flag if these events are not part of a known legitimate process (e.g., group policy enforcement).\n\n2. **`setup.exe` in EdgeUpdate Directory**:\n   - While updates are normal, the absence of additional context (e.g., network traffic, execution logs) makes it hard to confirm legitimacy. If this file is not part of a verified update, it could be a dropped payload.\n\n3. **`svchost.exe` Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `svchost.exe` might indicate:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying registry keys for startup or service configuration).\n     - **Malware evasion** (e.g., altering registry to avoid detection).\n\n4. **PowerShell Script Execution**:\n   - The script's purpose is unclear. While it may be benign (e.g., system health check), its execution via `Engine Lifecycle` (a generic event) lacks context. If this script is not part of a known tool or process, it could be a sign of compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate User Account Management Events**:\n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., authentication attempts, group policy changes) to determine if they are part of a legitimate process or indicate unauthorized activity.\n\n2. **Analyze `setup.exe` and `svchost.exe` Behavior**:\n   - Check for associated network traffic, parent processes, or file hashes to validate legitimacy.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to inspect `svchost.exe` activity.\n\n3. **Review PowerShell Script**:\n   - Audit the script's origin and purpose. If it's unexpected, block execution and investigate its source.\n\n4. **Monitor Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration change and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile many events are benign, the **repetitive User Account Management logs**, **unusual `svchost.exe` activity**, and **ambiguous PowerShell script** suggest **potential compromise** or **unauthorized system changes**. Further investigation is recommended to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll go through each event and note any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first entry: chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, maybe part of updates or settings changes. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nNext, MsMpEng.exe (which is Windows Defender's process) loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so probably okay. But sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. Hmm, but the file path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll, which is correct. So maybe not an issue here.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. The path is in the Downloads folder, but that's where users might install things. Doesn't look bad.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again. That's another legitimate process. Same file path as before. No red flags here.\n\nsvchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization folders. That's part of Windows Update and Delivery Optimization, which is normal. The files are cache and state files. Standard behavior.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an Edge installer file. That's expected during an update. Then, later, it deletes a temporary file. That's normal cleanup. No issues here.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe (Windows Defender) loading various DLLs and creating a lock file. All these are part of Defender's operations. The paths are correct. No signs of malicious activity.\n\nThen there's conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is part of the console host, which is normal. Mintty is a terminal emulator, so if the user is running it, setting registry values could be part of configuration changes. Not suspicious unless there's unexpected changes, but the logs don't specify what values were set.\n\nThe entry with process null and task \"None\" might be an error or incomplete log, but without more info, it's hard to say. Doesn't seem harmful.\n\nGit.exe creating files in a project's node_modules directory. That's standard for Git when cloning or pulling repositories. The files mentioned are part of the semver package, which is a common npm package. All looks normal here.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. All the processes involved are legitimate. No unexpected file paths or unusual activities. The only thing that stands out is the repeated loading of taskschd.dll by MsMpEng.exe and MpCmdRun.exe, but since the paths are correct, it's probably just normal operations. Also, the presence of multiple FileCreate events for Git and node_modules is normal during development.\n\nNo signs of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious network activity. All events seem to be part of regular user activities, software updates, and development work. Therefore, this log doesn't indicate any security issues that require investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent normal system and user activities without evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Processes**:\n   - **`MsMpEng.exe`** (Windows Defender) and **`MpCmdRun.exe`** loading system DLLs (e.g., `taskschd.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) from valid paths (`C:\\Windows\\System32`, `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform`). These are standard operations for antivirus\/endpoint protection software.\n   - **`svchost.exe`** creating files in **`DeliveryOptimization`** directories (e.g., cache\/state files). This is part of Windows Update and peer-to-peer content delivery.\n\n2. **User Activities**:\n   - **`git.exe`** creating files in **`node_modules`** directories (e.g., `semver.js`, `clean.js`). This aligns with typical Git operations during repository cloning or package installation.\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** generating a configuration file (`semver.js`). Winlogbeat is a legitimate log-shipper tool, and temporary configuration files are expected during setup.\n\n3. **Terminal Emulators**:\n   - **`conhost.exe`** and **`mintty.exe`** modifying registry values. These are standard for terminal emulators and console hosts, especially during user-initiated configuration changes.\n\n4. **Cleanup Operations**:\n   - **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`** deleting temporary installer files. This is a routine post-installation cleanup.\n\n### **No Suspicious Activity Detected**\n- All file paths, processes, and operations align with expected behavior for the listed applications.\n- No anomalies such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or non-standard file modifications are present.\n- The single entry with **`process: null`** and **`task: None`** appears to be a logging artifact or incomplete record but does not indicate a threat.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries reflect routine system operations, software updates, and user activities. **No actionable security threats or indicators of compromise (IoCs)** are present. No further investigation is warranted based on this data. \n\n**Final Verdict**: *Not interesting for investigation.*"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that a file was created in the node_modules\\semver\\functions directory by git.exe. The files are all JavaScript files, like compare-build.js, compare-loose.js, compare.js, and others. \n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that all the events are related to file creation, and the process involved is git.exe. Now, git is a common tool for version control, and during operations like cloning a repository or pulling changes, it's normal for git to create files. However, the number of files here is quite a lot. Let me count them. There are 20 entries here, each for a different file in the semver\\functions directory.\n\nWait, semver is a package used for semantic versioning in Node.js projects. The functions directory in semver would contain utility functions for version comparison, parsing, etc. So, if someone is using git to clone a project that has a node_modules directory with semver, it's possible that these files are part of the normal package installation. However, git typically doesn't create files in the node_modules directory. Usually, that's handled by npm or yarn when installing dependencies. \n\nSo, maybe the user ran a git command that somehow resulted in the creation of these files. But why would git be creating them? That seems unusual. Another possibility is that the user is using a git hook or some custom script that's generating these files. Alternatively, maybe there's a misconfiguration or a malicious activity where git is being used to inject files into the node_modules directory. \n\nBut wait, looking at the file paths, they are all under the Downloads directory, specifically in a folder structure related to a course (S206 - Qualidade de Software). This might be a student's project. If the user is working on a project that uses semver as a dependency, then the node_modules directory would normally be created by npm, not git. So, if git is creating these files, that's not standard behavior. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that maybe the user is using a git repository that includes the node_modules directory, which is not common practice. Typically, node_modules is excluded via .gitignore. If the user has accidentally committed node_modules and is pulling it down, git would checkout those files. But in that case, the process would be git.exe, and the files would be created as part of the checkout. \n\nBut even so, having 20 files being created in the functions directory by git might be a red flag. Another angle: are these files legitimate? The names like compare.js, parse.js, etc., are typical for semver functions. So, if the files are legitimate, then it's just a normal checkout. However, if the files were created by an attacker, perhaps through a malicious git repository, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity. They just list the files being created. Without additional context, like the user running a suspicious command or the files having unexpected content, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that git is creating files in node_modules is not standard. Normally, that's done by package managers. \n\nSo, the key point here is that git.exe is responsible for creating these files in the node_modules directory. While it's possible if the user is checking out a repository that includes node_modules, it's not the usual behavior. This could be a sign of a misconfigured repository or a potential security issue. However, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut given that all the files are legitimate semver functions and the path is under a user's Downloads directory, it might just be a case of the user checking out a repository that includes node_modules, which is not typical but possible. Therefore, the logs might not indicate a security threat but rather an unusual usage of git. However, it's still worth noting as an anomaly.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that **git.exe** created 20 JavaScript files in the `node_modules\\semver\\functions` directory. While the files themselves (e.g., `compare.js`, `parse.js`, etc.) are legitimate and part of the **semver** package (used for semantic versioning in Node.js projects), the **process responsible for creating them—git.exe—raises a red flag**. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Normal Behavior of git.exe**:\n   - Git typically **does not create files in `node_modules`**. This directory is usually managed by **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** during dependency installation.\n   - If `node_modules` were part of a Git repository (which is **not standard** due to `.gitignore`), cloning it would result in files being checked out by Git. However, this is **highly unusual** and often indicates a misconfigured repository.\n\n2. **Legitimacy of the Files**:\n   - The filenames (e.g., `compare.js`, `satisfies.js`, `valid.js`) match the expected utilities of the **semver** package. This suggests the files are **not malicious** in content.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - The files are located in a **student project directory** (`Downloads\\...S206...`), which may imply the user is working on a project that includes `semver` as a dependency.\n   - The absence of errors or suspicious file content (e.g., obfuscation, unexpected binaries) reduces the likelihood of an active attack.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **Misconfigured Git Repository**:\n  - The repository might accidentally include `node_modules` (violating `.gitignore` best practices). Cloning such a repo would trigger Git to create these files.\n  - **Risk**: This is not inherently malicious but could lead to bloated repositories or unintended exposure of sensitive data.\n\n- **Custom Git Hooks or Scripts**:\n  - A Git hook (e.g., `post-checkout`) or a script executed during a Git operation might generate these files. This is **uncommon** but possible if the user has non-standard workflows.\n\n- **Malicious Activity (Low Probability)**:\n  - If the repository is **malicious**, Git could be used to inject files into `node_modules`. However, the logs do not provide evidence of this (e.g., no unexpected file contents, no network activity, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Repository Configuration**:\n   - Ensure `node_modules` is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`. If it's included, consider removing it from the repo to avoid future issues.\n\n2. **Audit the Files**:\n   - Manually inspect the created files to confirm they align with the expected `semver` package code. Use tools like `npm ls semver` to verify the dependency is legitimate.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - If `git.exe` frequently creates files in `node_modules`, investigate further for potential misuse of Git hooks or scripts.\n\n4. **Security Best Practices**:\n   - Avoid committing `node_modules` to version control.\n   - Use **trusted sources** for dependencies and verify their integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not indicate **immediate malicious activity**, the **unusual involvement of git.exe in creating `node_modules` files** is atypical and warrants further investigation. It is most likely a **misconfiguration** or **non-standard workflow**, but vigilance is advised to rule out potential security risks."}

So, there are multiple entries here, all from git.exe creating files in the node_modules\\sshpk directory. The files being created are various JavaScript files and some man pages. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Git is a version control system, and when you install packages via npm, it often extracts files into node_modules. The sshpk package is a Node.js library for handling SSH keys. The files listed here seem to be part of that package's structure—like pem.js, pkcs1.js, and others related to SSH formats, plus man pages for commands like sshpk-conv and sshpk-sign.\n\nBut wait, why are all these files being created with the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"? If this is part of a normal npm install, then it's expected. However, if git.exe is creating these files, maybe there's something off. Typically, npm would handle the installation, not git. But maybe the user ran a git command that's part of the installation process, like cloning a repository that includes these files.\n\nAlternatively, could this be a sign of a malicious activity? For example, if an attacker is using git to write files that shouldn't be there. But looking at the paths, they are in the node_modules directory, which is standard for npm packages.

But if the user is installing a package that includes these files, then it's normal. However, if the user didn't intend to install this package, or if the files are being created in an unexpected location, that could be an issue. But in this case, the path seems correct for a node_modules directory.\n\nI should check if the sshpk package is known for having these files. A quick mental note: sshpk is a real package, and its structure includes the lib directory with those JS files and man pages.
