{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe doing that? I should check if SDXHelper is a known malicious file. Hmm, not sure, but maybe it's a legitimate process. However, repeating the same image load events multiple times might be a red flag. Like, if a process is loading the same DLLs over and over, that's unusual.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll. That's common, but the command line looks a bit odd with that GUID. Maybe it's part of a legitimate operation, but sometimes attackers use rundll32 for malicious purposes. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's normal for a log file, but maybe the path is suspicious? The filename is .yml.new, which could be part of a configuration update. Not immediately harmful, but worth noting.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. Loading those might be normal, but if Excel is doing that, maybe it's being used to bypass security checks. Also, the user opened a CSV file, which could be a vector for malicious content if the file is crafted to trigger exploits.\n\nWait, there are multiple ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE with different DLLs. Some of them are system DLLs, but others like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are related to .NET. That's normal for Excel if it's using .NET components. However, the presence of multiple image loads might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of User Account Management tasks, which might be normal system activity. The svchost.exe and services.exe entries are typical for system processes. The WmiPrvSE.exe is part of WMI, which is used by legitimate processes but can also be abused by malware.\n\nNow, the key points: SDXHelper.exe repeatedly loading system DLLs. Is that normal? Maybe not. Also, the EXCEL.EXE loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll could be an attempt to disable antivirus features. Wait, but if it's loading them, that might be normal. Alternatively, if it's trying to bypass them, but that's more about the process's behavior than just loading the DLLs.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for the same process and DLLs. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then loading those DLLs is fine. But if it's a malicious process, that's a problem. However, without knowing the context of SDXHelper.exe, it's hard to tell. But in many cases, SDXHelper.exe is associated with malware, like the SDBot trojan. So that's a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of SDXHelper.exe with multiple image loads, combined with Excel loading security-related DLLs, and the rundll32 command with a GUID, could indicate potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these factors might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repetitive `SDXHelper.exe` Image Loads:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** repeatedly loads system DLLs like `combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, and `coml2.dll`. While these are legitimate system files, **SDXHelper.exe** is often associated with **malware** (e.g., SDBot trojan). Its repeated use of `ImageLoad` events may indicate **DLL hijacking** or **unusual process behavior**.\n\n2. **Suspicious `rundll32.exe` Command:**\n   - The command line `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wbem\\wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding` executed by **WmiPrvSE.exe** is unusual. While `rundll32.exe` is legitimate, the use of `-secured` and `-Embedding` flags could hint at **WMI-based attacks** or **malicious process injection**.\n\n3. **Excel.exe Loading Security-Related DLLs:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** loads `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender Antimalware Scan Interface) and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus). While this could be normal (e.g., if Excel is interacting with security tools), it raises concerns if **malicious content** (e.g., a crafted CSV file) is being used to **bypass or tamper with security mechanisms**.\n\n4. **Unusual `DnsQuery` Event:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE**发起的 DNS 查询 (e.g., `Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)`) could indicate **malicious network communication** (e.g., C2 traffic) if tied to the CSV file opened by the user.\n\n5. **High Frequency of \"User Account Management\" Events:**\n   - Multiple entries with the task **\"User Account Management\"** may indicate **privilege escalation attempts** or **account manipulation**, though this requires correlation with other logs (e.g., logon events).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity:**\n- **Winlogbeat.exe** creating a `.yml.new` file in the Downloads directory is typical for **log configuration updates**.\n- **WmiPrvSE.exe** and **svchost.exe** are legitimate system processes, though their behavior should be validated in context.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Check if **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process (e.g., via reputation databases, file hashes, or digital signatures). If unknown, isolate the system and perform a malware scan.\n\n2. **Analyze the CSV File:**\n   - Examine the **CSV file opened by Excel** for embedded malicious content (e.g., macros, obfuscated scripts, or network payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor WMI and DNS Activity:**\n   - Investigate **WMI-related processes** (e.g., `WmiPrvSE.exe`) for signs of **remote code execution** or **lateral movement**.\n   - Correlate **DNS queries** with known malicious domains or C2 infrastructure.\n\n4. **Check for Amsi\/MpOAV Tampering:**\n   - Verify if **Amsi.dll** or **MpOAV.dll** has been **hooked or modified** (e.g., via `amsiScanBuffer` bypass techniques).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **mixed signals**, with **potential indicators of compromise** (e.g., SDXHelper.exe, suspicious DNS queries). While some activity is legitimate, the combination of **unusual process behavior**, **security-related DLL loads**, and **repetitive events** suggests **further investigation is required** to rule out malware or advanced threats."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, both are from EXCEL.EXE creating a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder under Microsoft Office. The path is in the AppData\\Roaming directory. That seems a bit odd because the Recent folder usually stores shortcuts to recently opened files. But creating a .LNK file there might not be suspicious on its own. However, the fact that it's being created by Excel could be a red flag. Maybe someone is trying to plant a shortcut that could be used for malicious purposes, like a dropper or something.\n\nThen there are three entries where the process is null, and the task is \"None\". Those might be incomplete or malformed logs, but they don't show any obvious malicious activity. They might just be noise or errors in the logging system.\n\nNext, there are three entries from EXCEL.EXE performing DNS queries. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if Excel is making a lot of DNS queries, that could indicate it's communicating with a command-and-control server. However, the logs don't provide the domain names being queried, so I can't confirm that. But combined with the file creation, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main points are: Excel creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory and multiple DNS queries from Excel. The .LNK file could be a shortcut to a malicious file, but without more info, it's hard to tell. The DNS queries might be part of exfiltrating data or connecting to a C2 server. However, the logs are limited. There's no mention of other processes, network connections, or other suspicious activities. The presence of multiple DNS queries from Excel could be a sign of something, but it's not conclusive. The file creation might be benign if it's just a normal shortcut. But the combination of these events, especially if they're occurring in a short time frame, might warrant further investigation.\n\nHowever, since the logs don't show any clear indicators of compromise, like unusual network traffic, unauthorized access, or known malicious domains, the confidence level might be moderate. The justification would be that there's a combination of unusual file creation and DNS queries from Excel, which could be part of a larger attack, but without more data, it's not certain. So, I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Excel processes creating a .LNK file in the Office Recent directory and performing DNS queries, which could indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. The combination of file creation and network activity warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
