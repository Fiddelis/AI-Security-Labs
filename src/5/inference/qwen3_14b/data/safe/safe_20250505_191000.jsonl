{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The majority of them are related to User Account Management under winlog's task, but those might be normal administrative activities. However, there are a few events that stand out. \n\nFirst, there's an event where EXCEL.EXE loaded an image from coml2.dll. Wait, coml2.dll is part of the Windows COM library, but loading it from System32 seems normal. Maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen, there are multiple FileCreate events where EXCEL.EXE created a .LNK file in the Recent folder. Shortcut files can be used for malicious purposes, like hiding the real payload. Creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory might be an attempt to leave a backdoor or track user activity.\n\nAlso, there are several DnsQuery events from EXCEL.EXE. While Excel might perform DNS lookups for various reasons, multiple queries could indicate communication with a command-and-control server. However, without more context like the domains queried, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe other events with task \"None\" don't provide much info. \n\nPutting it all together: the FileCreate events for the .LNK file and multiple DnsQueries from Excel might be suspicious. But is this enough to classify as interesting? Maybe. The creation of a shortcut in the Recent folder could be a red flag, especially if it's part of a larger pattern. However, without more evidence like unusual network traffic or other malicious activities, it's a bit uncertain. The confidence might be around 0.65. It's not definitive, but there are enough anomalies to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent directory and performing DNS queries, which could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or C2 communication.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe doing that? I should check if that's normal. SDXHelper.exe might be part of some software, but loading those DLLs multiple times... Hmm, not sure yet. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nThen there are some User Account Management events, but they don't have a process name or file path. Maybe that's just normal account activity. Not too concerning unless there's a pattern. But the logs don't show any failed attempts or unusual account changes here.\n\nNext, rundll32.exe is running with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. That GUID part looks a bit odd. Sometimes, malware uses rundll32 with unusual parameters. But I need to check if this is a known legitimate use. Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but the -Embedding flag is sometimes used by malicious code. Not sure yet, but this could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe and Registry value set events. Those are common for system processes, so maybe normal. Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. That's probably part of its normal operation, like configuring settings. EXCEL.EXE opening a CSV file, which seems legitimate. But then EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But why is EXCEL.EXE loading so many system DLLs? Maybe it's just normal, but sometimes malware can inject code into processes, so need to check if there's anything else.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe is running with the -secured and -Embedding flags. Again, that might be normal for some operations, but I've seen those flags in some malicious contexts too. The image loaded event for wmiutils.dll is part of the WMI service, so that's probably okay.\n\nLooking back at SDXHelper.exe, it's loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. Those are system DLLs, so maybe it's just normal, but if a process is loading the same DLL multiple times, that could be a sign of something. However, sometimes processes do load DLLs multiple times for different reasons. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple events from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's part of its setup, so probably normal. The EXCEL.EXE process seems to be doing normal operations, loading necessary DLLs.\n\nWait, but SDXHelper.exe is a process that's not very common. Maybe it's part of some third-party software, but if it's repeatedly loading system DLLs, that might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the presence of rundll32.exe with that command line could be a sign of something. But I need to check if those are known malicious patterns.\n\nIn the absence of other red flags, like network connections, file modifications, or user account changes, maybe this isn't too bad. But the repeated ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe might be worth investigating. However, the confidence isn't super high because some of these could be normal. Maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" but with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll) repeatedly, which may indicate unusual process behavior. Additionally, rundll32.exe executed with a suspicious command line containing a GUID and -Embedding flag, which is sometimes associated with malicious activity. While some events appear benign (e.g., EXCEL.EXE loading legitimate DLLs), the combination of these patterns warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
