I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's legitimate. The files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages folder. That seems a bit odd because Office typically doesn't generate JavaScript files in that location.

If these files are being created as part of a normal operation, there should be some context or other logs that explain why. But since there are no other events here, like process starts or network activity, it's hard to tell. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a non-standard location raises suspicion.\n\nI should also think about the confidence level. The user wants a confidence score between 0 and 1. Since all the events are the same and the files are in a suspicious location, I'd say there's a moderate to high chance this is interesting. But maybe there's a legitimate reason.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, looking at the JSON entries, each one has a process named SDXHelper.exe, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files are all JavaScript files in a specific path under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages.\n\nFirst, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, related to solution packages. So, if it's creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory, that might be normal. But why are there so many entries for the same file paths? Wait, looking at the paths, each entry has a different hash in the filename, like 76826bebf9766d76354abacbd3b721ca.js, then another with 7840f8483f682308e9457dc2e801eb55.js, and so on. These different hashes suggest that each file is a different version or different content. \n\nBut the process is creating these files repeatedly. However, since the same file is being created multiple times, maybe it's part of an update or installation process. But wait, the same file path is mentioned multiple times. Wait, no, each entry has a different hash. So each file is unique. However, all of them are in the same directory and created by the same process. \n\nIs there a possibility that this is part of a legitimate Office update? Maybe. But I should also consider if creating multiple JavaScript files in that location is unusual. Office might use JavaScript for some components, but the number of files here seems high. Also, the fact that the same process is creating all these files might be normal if it's part of a package deployment. However, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to drop malicious files. \n\nBut the filenames here are all named \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by a hash. Copilot is a feature in Excel, so maybe these are localization files or some kind of resource files for Copilot. The hash could be part of the versioning. If that's the case, then this is normal activity. However, if these files are not part of any known legitimate distribution, that could be suspicious.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any other context, like if there are other events indicating malicious activity, I have to rely on the given data. All events are about file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate Office directory. The filenames include \"excel-copilot\", which is a known feature. The repetition of the same process and the same directory might be normal for an installation or update. However, the high number of files created might be a red flag. But without more information, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hash in the filename is a unique identifier, and each file is a separate part of a package. So, the process is creating multiple files as part of a package deployment. If that's the case, then it's legitimate. However, the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be a sign of something else. \n\nBut since all the events are from the same process and the same directory, and the files are in a known location for Office, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there's an indication that these files are malicious. But the justification would be that the files are created by a legitimate process in a legitimate directory, even though the number of files is high. However, the confidence might be medium because while it's possible that this is normal, it's also possible that it's part of a malicious activity.

SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's a legitimate process? However, the fact that it's creating multiple files in the Office SolutionPackages folder might be normal if it's part of an Office add-in or update. But wait, the file names have hashes, which could be a sign of obfuscation. Also, the paths are in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific data but can also be a target for malware.\n\nLooking at the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. Each entry is duplicated, which might be a red flag. If the same file is created multiple times, maybe it's part of a process that's being repeated unnecessarily, or perhaps there's a loop or a malicious activity that's generating these files. But then again, maybe it's just a logging issue or the system is re-creating files for some reason.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"vendors~\" in some filenames. That might be a reference to third-party libraries, but the specific naming could be something unusual. Also, the presence of \"sccservicevoiceaugloop\" in one of the filenames – that seems like a random string, which might not be standard. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the reputation of SDXHelper.exe, whether it's a known legitimate process, or if there are other logs indicating malicious activity (like network connections, registry changes, etc.), it's hard to be certain. The logs here only show file creation events. \n\nBut considering that these files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is part of Microsoft's ecosystem, it's possible that these are part of a legitimate package or update. However, the high number of files and the repetitive nature might indicate something off. Alternatively, maybe the user is running a process that's generating these files as part of a normal operation, but the hashes in the filenames could be a way to uniquely identify each version.\n\nWait, but the same file paths are logged multiple times. Each entry is a separate log line, but the same file is created more than once. That might be normal if the process is creating the same file multiple times during its execution, but it's also possible that it's a sign of a loop or a malicious payload trying to create multiple files. However, without additional context, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering the classification, the key is whether there's enough evidence to flag this as interesting. Since all the events are related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, but there's no indication of other malicious activities, maybe it's not a high priority. However, the repetition and the nature of the filenames might be enough to warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, I think the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence level.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, there are multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all named similarly, with \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by a hash. The paths are all under the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder.\n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft's Office solution deployment. But creating so many files with those names... Maybe it's just part of a normal update or installation. However, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might be a red flag. Wait, looking at the entries, each file is created twice. For example, the first entry is for excel-copilot-strings_78e259be...js, and then the same file is created again. That's repeated for several other files as well. \n\nWhy would the same file be created multiple times? That doesn't seem normal. Typically, during an installation or update, files are created once. Repeated creation could indicate something like a loop, or maybe a malicious process trying to overwrite or inject code. Also, the presence of multiple files with similar names might be part of a larger payload. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the registry event is from MdSched.exe, which is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Defender. But the registry value set event isn't necessarily suspicious here. The main concern is the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe. \n\nWait, could this be a false positive? Maybe the system is deploying multiple packages, hence the same files being created. However, the same file being created twice in quick succession might not be standard. Also, the hash in the filenames might be part of the package identifiers, but if they're all different, that's normal. However, the same file being created multiple times is not. \n\nI should check if there's any known malicious activity associated with these filenames. \"Excel-copilot-strings\" might be related to a feature in Excel, but the hash part is just an identifier. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with these names, and each is created twice, might be indicative of something. \n\nAnother angle: the process SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, but if it's being used as a vector for malicious activity, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show any other suspicious activity like network connections or process injections. The only events are file creation and a registry change. \n\nBut considering that the same file is being created multiple times, that's unusual. It could be a sign of a script or process that's malfunctioning, or perhaps a malicious actor trying to leave multiple copies of a file. However, without additional context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here would be moderate. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the repetitive file creation by a legitimate process might warrant further investigation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names include things like excel-copilot-strings with various hashes and vendors~researchnotebook.js, vendors~researchworkspace.js, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So maybe it's related to some legitimate Office processes. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the OfflineFiles directory might be a red flag. Typically, Office might download or generate some files, but the repetition of the same file names could indicate something else.\n\nWait, looking at the paths, they're all in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles subdirectory. The use of \"OfflineFiles\" might be part of a legitimate process where files are cached for offline use. But the names like \"vendors~researchnotebook.js\" and similar don't ring a bell. Are these standard files? I'm not sure. Maybe they are part of some add-ins or extensions, but the repeated creation of the same files might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is known to be associated with Microsoft's Office 365 and some other services. But if this is a legitimate process, why are so many files being created? It's possible that the user is installing or updating some components, but the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate a problem. However, in the given data, each file is created twice, except for the last ones which are created once. Wait, looking again, some files are created twice, others once. But the same file names are appearing multiple times. That could be a sign of a loop or an error in the process, or maybe a legitimate action that's being repeated.\n\nAnother angle: the file names have hashes in them, which might be part of versioning. For example, \"excel-copilot-strings_68fa3d8d421a10183f19db8ce5721015.js\" – the part after the underscore could be a hash or identifier. That might be normal for version control. However, the presence of multiple such files could be part of a legitimate update process, but if they're being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a helper process, maybe it's part of a legitimate Office feature.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any indication of malicious activity. The files are all JavaScript files, which could be benign, but they could also be used for malicious purposes if they're being injected or modified. However, the logs only mention the creation of the files, not their content or any execution. So without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point: the same process (SDXHelper.exe) is creating all these files. If this is a legitimate process, then creating these files in the specified directory might be normal. However, if the process is compromised, it could be generating these files as part of a malicious payload. But there's no evidence here of execution or network activity, just file creation.\n\nConsidering all this, the events might be part of a legitimate Office process, but the repetitive creation of files with similar names could be a sign of something unusual. However, without more data (like process parent, user context, or network connections), it's challenging to determine if this is malicious. But since all the events are about file creation by a known process in a typical Office directory, maybe it's not interesting.

If it's a legitimate process, maybe there's a reason for multiple files. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory path might suggest something else. \n\nAlso, looking at the path: AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages.

However, the sheer number of files (each entry is a separate creation event) might be unusual. \n\nBut wait, the same file paths are repeated in the logs. Are these multiple events for the same file, or different ones? Each entry has a different hash, so each is a different file. But why would SDXHelper.exe create so many JavaScript files in that location? It could be part of a legitimate process, like installing multiple language packs or resources. However, the name \"excel-copilot-strings\" makes me think of Excel Copilot, which is a feature in newer Office versions. Maybe these are resource files for that feature. \n\nBut then again, if this is a malicious activity, SDXHelper.exe could be compromised, and these files might be part of a payload.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling solution packages, maybe for add-ins or something similar. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be part of installing or updating an add-in. But why so many files? Each entry is a separate file creation, but they all seem to be part of the same package, given the directory structure and the similar filenames.\n\nNow, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which could indicate different versions or parts of the same package. However, the repetition of the same process and the same directory path might be normal during an installation. But wait, the same file is being created multiple times? Wait, no, looking at the paths, each entry has a different hash, so they're different files. So maybe it's unpacking a package into multiple files.\n\nBut why would this be suspicious? Well, if this is part of a legitimate Office add-in installation, then it's normal. However, if the files are being created in a directory that's not typical for Office, or if the process isn't expected to be creating so many files, that could be a red flag.

Yes, it's associated with Microsoft Office. However, sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes. But the filenames here are JavaScript files, which are common for web-based add-ins.

The fact that they're minified (the .min in the filename) suggests they might be compressed for efficiency, which is normal for web resources.\n\nAnother thing to check is the repetition of events. The same file is created multiple times, but maybe that's because the process is being called multiple times or there are multiple packages being installed.

But why are they being created multiple times? Maybe the process is being called repeatedly, which could be unusual.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the directory structure. The files are in OfflineFiles under PackageResources. That seems like a standard location for Office packages. However, if these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, it might just be part of normal operations. But the high number of events (over 15 entries) might indicate something. However, looking at the data, there are duplicates in the entries. For example, the same file path is logged twice for some entries. Maybe that's just logging redundancy, but it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, the filenames include \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and \"word-copilot.min\", which might relate to Microsoft Copilot integration in Office. If the system is updating or installing Copilot features, this could be legitimate. However, if there's no recent update or installation, this might be suspicious. But without more context, like other events or user activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe key here is that all events are from a legitimate process in a legitimate directory, but the repetition and the number of files created might be unusual. However, since SDXHelper.exe is a known process and the paths are standard, this might just be normal activity. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious behavior indicated. But I'm a bit unsure because the repetition could hint at something. However, without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, privilege escalation, or other anomalies, it's probably safe to classify as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in standard Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directories, which aligns with legitimate Office update\/installation behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided multiple JSON entries, all indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files being created have names like word-copilot.min_... and officeaicopilot-strings.min_..., with different hash-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or solutions. However, creating multiple files with those names in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be part of a legitimate process, such as caching or updating packages. But why are there so many entries? Each entry is a file creation event, and they're all from the same process.\n\nWait, the paths are all within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. That's a common location for temporary or cached files. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. If the same file is created multiple times, maybe there's an issue with the process, or perhaps it's part of a normal operation where multiple versions are being generated.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they have min_ followed by a long string. That might be minified JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. But in the context of Office, maybe they're part of some add-in or copilot feature. However, the presence of multiple such files with different hashes might indicate that they're being generated dynamically, which could be normal or could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nBut here's the thing: the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft process. If this is a legitimate process, then creating these files might be normal. However, the high number of file creations (over 15 entries) might be unusual. But maybe each entry is a different file, just with similar names. Let me check the paths again. The first few entries have different GUIDs in the path (like 8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c and 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b), which might correspond to different packages. So each package might be generating multiple files. That could be normal if the packages are being installed or updated.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes might be normal for different versions. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is a standard event. If these are all legitimate, then the classification would be NOT INTERESTING. But if there's a possibility that SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously to create these files, then it's INTERESTING.\n\nBut considering that SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process, and the files are in the expected directory, this might be a normal part of Office's operation, such as downloading and caching resources for copilot features. Unless there are other indicators of compromise, like unexpected network activity or other suspicious processes, these logs alone might not be enough to flag as malicious.\n\nHowever, the high number of file creations might be more than usual. But without more context, like other events or known bad behavior, it's hard to say. The justification here would be that the events are related to a legitimate process creating files in a standard location, but the repetition might warrant further investigation. However, since the user is asking for classification based on the batch, and given that the process is legitimate and the files are in the expected path, it's likely NOT INTERESTING. But I'm not 100% confident. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6, as there's some unusual repetition but no clear malicious indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show SDXHelper.exe (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) creating JavaScript files in expected Office SolutionPackages directories.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries for the same files being created repeatedly. For example, the officeaicopilotchatstrings_af_...js file is mentioned twice, and the word-copilot.min_...js files are also duplicated.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Typically, Microsoft Office-related processes are things like EXCEL.EXE or WINWORD.EXE. SDXHelper.exe might be part of some third-party software or an add-in. But why would it be creating these JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory? That seems a bit unusual. Normally, Office might use such directories for storing resources, but the repeated creation of files with unique hashes (like 46ff5943d6963f95d5aaa582c21b4928.js) makes me think these could be malicious payloads. \n\nAlso, the filenames include things like \"officeaicopilotchatstrings\" and \"word-copilot.min\", which might be related to some copilot feature, but the presence of multiple hashes suggests different files being created, possibly as part of a dropper or a downloader. The repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate an attempt to persist or spread the malware. \n\nHowever, I should consider if this is a legitimate activity. Maybe the user is installing some Office add-on or update that's generating these files. But the lack of other processes or events related to installation or updates makes me lean towards malicious intent. The fact that all these files are created by the same process in a non-standard location (AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages) raises suspicion. \n\nAnother point is the use of the SolutionPackages folder. Typically, that's used for storing solution packages in Office, but creating files there with such names might be an attempt to hide the malicious files among legitimate ones. The hashes in the filenames are unique, which could be a way to avoid detection by signature-based methods. \n\nConsidering all this, the repeated creation of multiple files by an unknown process in a sensitive directory is a red flag. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like network connections or process injections, the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I think this batch is interesting and should be classified as such with a confidence level around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with unique hashes are created repeatedly by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, suggesting potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
