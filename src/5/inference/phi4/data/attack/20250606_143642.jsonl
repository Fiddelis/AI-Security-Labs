{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided JSON snippets appear to be logs of various system activities related to processes running on a Windows operating system. Here's an analysis based on the content:\n\n### Processes and Activities\n\n1. **Network Connections**:\n   - Logs indicate that `winlogon.exe` attempted a network connection using IP `10.8.200.4`. This might be part of the usual startup routine or a service-related activity.\n\n2. **Process Creation and Execution**:\n   - The `powershell.exe` process is frequently created, suggesting scripts are being run. Commands executed include `whoami.exe`, indicating a potential check for user permissions.\n   - There's an instance of `powershell.exe` removing files (`entrada_principal.zip`) from the Temp directory.\n\n3. **Registry Events**:\n   - Modifications to the registry by `services.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and again `powershell.exe`. These changes might relate to configurations needed for script execution or malware activity.\n\n4. **File Operations**:\n   - Creation of a temporary PowerShell script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) by `powershell.exe` followed by its deletion, which could suggest dynamic script execution.\n   \n5. **Image Loading**:\n   - Various DLL files and system components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded into memory, typical for PowerShell operations involving .NET libraries.\n\n### Potential Concerns\n\n- The frequent creation of processes like `powershell.exe` with various commands can be indicative of automated scripts or potentially malicious activity.\n  \n- Registry modifications by several executables (including `powershell.exe`) might indicate attempts to alter system configurations, possibly for persistence or disabling security features.\n\n- File operations involving temporary files and their subsequent deletion may suggest efforts to obscure actions taken on the system.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Regularly review logs for unexpected PowerShell scripts and commands. Consider implementing logging policies that capture more detailed script execution data.\n  \n- **Audit Registry Changes**: Use tools like Windows Defender or third-party security software to monitor and audit registry changes, ensuring they align with expected behavior.\n\n- **Enhance Security Policies**: Implement stricter access controls on sensitive directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) and consider applying application whitelisting to restrict unauthorized script execution.\n\nThis analysis suggests a need for heightened monitoring of system activities, especially those involving PowerShell and registry modifications, to ensure they are legitimate and secure."}
