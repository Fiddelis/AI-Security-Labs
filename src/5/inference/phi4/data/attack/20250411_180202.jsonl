Events such as 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'File created' using PowerShell suggest possible privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms being employed, which are typical in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware activity. Additionally, the use of `WMIC.exe` with multiple image loads could indicate attempts to bypass security controls.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
