This could indicate an attempt to run persistent or unauthorized tasks on the system.\n   - The presence of a binary (`tarefa_logico.exe`) in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin` suggests potential tampering or malware execution, especially if these paths are not commonly used for legitimate applications.\n\n5. **Security Concerns**:\n   - Changes to registry values and repeated service creation could be signs of a compromised system where malicious software is trying to establish persistence.\n   - The use of `svchost.exe` and other system processes in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell commands might indicate an attempt to disguise or execute malware.\n\n6. **Recommendations**:\n   - Investigate the legitimacy of the \"objeto_ativo\" service and `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - Review registry changes for unauthorized modifications.\n   - Conduct a full system scan using updated antivirus software to detect any malicious files or processes.\n   - Monitor network traffic for unusual activity that might indicate data exfiltration.\n\nOverall, this log indicates potential security issues that require further investigation to ensure the integrity and safety of the system."}
