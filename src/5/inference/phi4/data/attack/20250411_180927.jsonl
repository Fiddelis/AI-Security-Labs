The use of `net1.exe`, a non-standard executable name for `net.exe`, could indicate an attempt to evade detection or perform unauthorized actions. Additionally, several processes (e.g., `HxTsr.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `OneDrive.exe`) are involved in registry modifications, which might be indicative of malicious behavior. The frequent user account and security group management events suggest potential misuse or compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
