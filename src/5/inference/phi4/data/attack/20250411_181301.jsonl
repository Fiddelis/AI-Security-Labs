Powershell is frequently used for legitimate tasks but can be abused for malicious purposes when misused to set registry values or access processes. Additionally, tasklist.exe loading a non-standard image 'amsi.dll' directly could indicate potential evasion of anti-malware mechanisms like AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface). The pattern and combination of these actions suggest possible malicious behavior worthy of further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
