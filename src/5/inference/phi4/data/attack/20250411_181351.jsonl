The use of PowerShell for capturing screen contents and saving it to a temporary location is often associated with data exfiltration or preparation for further malicious actions. There are numerous registry events set by multiple processes, including 'powershell.exe', 'conhost.exe', and 'chrome.exe', which could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes typically seen in malware activities. The use of 'winlogbeat' suggests possible log collection that might be used to monitor system activities for further exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple entries involving powershell.exe with command lines that capture screenshots indicate potential malicious activity. Registry changes and frequent process access also raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell**: The batch contains numerous events where `powershell.exe` is accessed or used to execute commands. This alone isn't suspicious, but in combination with other factors, it raises red flags.\n\n2. **Screenshot Capture**: Several command lines involving `powershell.exe` are designed to capture screenshots and save them as temporary files (`unidade_logico.png`, `tarefa_comum.png`, `elemento_padrao.png`). This behavior is commonly associated with keyloggers or remote access trojans (RATs), which may be capturing screen data for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Events showing registry value changes by both `svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe` can indicate attempts to modify system settings, hide processes, or alter startup behaviorâ€”common techniques used by malware.\n\n4. **Process Access Patterns**: The repeated access to `powershell.exe` and other critical executables like `svchost.exe`, without corresponding file operations, suggests potential unauthorized access or manipulation of these processes.\n\n5. **Image Load Events**: Multiple events show `powershell.exe` loading various system libraries, which could be related to executing complex scripts that require those resources.\n\nGiven the combination of suspicious command execution, registry modifications, and process access patterns, this batch warrants further investigation for potential security threats. The confidence level is high due to multiple corroborating indicators of malicious activity."}
