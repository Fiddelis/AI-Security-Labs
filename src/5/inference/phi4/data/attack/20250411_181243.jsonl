Notable activities include file creation with PowerShell, registry value modifications involving several processes like 'conhost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and 'svchost.exe' (often associated with persistence or privilege escalation), and an unusual command executed via 'cmdkey.exe'. The repeated access of process permissions for processes such as 'powershell.exe' and 'winlogbeat.exe' is also suspicious. Additionally, there's evidence of a potentially malicious file named 'net1.exe', which mimics 'net.exe' but could be a custom or compromised binary. These patterns suggest possible unauthorized activity or preparation for further exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
