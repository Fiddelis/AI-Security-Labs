The repeated network connections from `chrome.exe` could indicate a compromised browser or command and control activity. The use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` for registry modifications, process creations, and access events suggests possible script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the loading of system DLLs by `WMIC.exe`, such as `urlmon.dll`, is unusual and can be associated with malicious activities like DLL hijacking.
