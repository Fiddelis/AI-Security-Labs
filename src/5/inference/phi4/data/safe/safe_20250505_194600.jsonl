Additionally, there are repeated file creation events by `winlogbeat.exe` and `notepad.exe`, which could indicate attempts to alter system configuration or store data covertly. The use of `notepad.exe` for potentially suspicious tasks like loading external images and creating files should also be investigated.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
