This could indicate an attempt to associate Discord with a custom URL scheme, which is commonly used by malware for command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\n2. **Frequent Process Access and Pipe Events:**\n   - There are numerous logs of `Discord.exe` being accessed and creating pipes. While not inherently malicious on its own, the combination with registry changes raises suspicion as it could indicate a compromised application attempting to communicate externally.\n\n3. **Overall Pattern:**\n   - The pattern of modifying the registry and frequent process interactions suggests potential misuse or compromise, warranting further investigation.\n\nGiven these points, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to the suspicious nature of the activities observed."}
