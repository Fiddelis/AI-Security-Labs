The presence of WMIC.exe loading system files like urlmon.dll is unusual, as WMIC should not typically interact with such DLLs in a benign manner. Additionally, the creation of temporary files by both PowerShell and winlogbeat suggests possible data exfiltration or configuration tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
