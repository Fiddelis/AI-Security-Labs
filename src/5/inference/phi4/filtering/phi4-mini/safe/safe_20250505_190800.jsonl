PowerShell is executing with 'ExecutionPolicy Bypass', which can be indicative of attempts to run scripts without standard security checks, possibly for malicious purposes. The presence of multiple image load and process access events suggests the loading of various system libraries, which could be used to obfuscate or support malicious operations.
