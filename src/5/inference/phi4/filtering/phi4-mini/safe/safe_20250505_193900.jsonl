Additionally, there are network connections initiated by both 'chrome.exe' and 'svchost.exe', which might be related to command-and-control communication. The use of WMI-related processes like 'WmiPrvSE.exe' and image load events for critical system files (such as amsi.dll) could also suggest attempts at evasion or exploitation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
