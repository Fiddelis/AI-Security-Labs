Malicious actors might exploit such processes to avoid detection.\n- **Lack of User Interaction**: These events seem automated, lacking clear user interaction which can be typical in malware deployment or script execution scenarios.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the plausible malicious potential while acknowledging that further investigation (e.g., content analysis) would be needed for definitive classification."}
