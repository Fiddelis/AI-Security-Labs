Additionally, command-line invocations involving deletion of 'notepad.exe' processes via WMI (WMIC.exe) and cmd.exe suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at cleaning traces of running processes. The use of 'cmd.exe' to replace the sticky keys executable (sethc.exe) with a backup version is another red flag for privilege escalation or persistence attempts.
