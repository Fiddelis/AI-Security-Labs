The use of certutil.exe to encode and decode files, especially encoding calc.exe and then decoding it as a different executable, is suspicious. This behavior suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications by both powershell.exe and chrome.exe are concerning, as they could indicate attempts to persist changes in system settings or configurations. The loading of SDXHelper.exe with System32 DLLs also raises suspicion, potentially indicating misuse of legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
