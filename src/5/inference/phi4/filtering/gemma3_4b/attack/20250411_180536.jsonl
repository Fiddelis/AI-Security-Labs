Powershell is frequently used for executing scripts that can perform a wide range of malicious tasks, such as privilege escalation and data exfiltration. The repeated registry access events and process accessed logs from powershell.exe raise concerns about potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms being set up. Additionally, the creation of a new configuration file for winlogbeat.exe ('C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new') could suggest an attempt to redirect logging data for malicious purposes or to establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
