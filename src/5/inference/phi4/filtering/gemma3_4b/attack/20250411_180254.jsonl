The use of tools like `powershell.exe` for registry modifications, process access, and the presence of `systeminfo.exe` commands can indicate reconnaissance or system information gathering. Additionally, multiple instances of `svchost.exe` performing registry changes could suggest malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms.
