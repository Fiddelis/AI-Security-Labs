Notably, there is a command-line event with `cmd.exe` querying system information and disk enumeration registry keys, and another using `reg.exe` performing similar queries, indicating potential reconnaissance activities. Additionally, frequent registry value set events triggered by various processes like `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, alongside multiple image load events for uncommon processes such as `WmiPrvSE.exe` with command-line parameters, suggest potential malicious behavior or configuration changes in the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
