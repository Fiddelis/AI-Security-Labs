{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious behavior including repeated access to powershell.exe and svchost.exe for registry events, and a process create event for whoami.exe which can be used for privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nThe batch contains several activities that warrant further investigation. The frequent access to `powershell.exe` is suspicious because it's often used by attackers to execute scripts or commands. Multiple registry value set events from `svchost.exe` are concerning due to their common use in persistence techniques and malware execution. Additionally, the creation of a process named `whoami.exe` at an unusual path (`C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32`) can indicate attempts for privilege escalation or information gathering on the system's user privileges. These combined activities suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants further scrutiny."}
