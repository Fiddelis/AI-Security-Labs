The events indicate attempts to create startup entries for executables ('estrutura_principal.exe' and 'pacote_temporario.exe') using both cmd.exe and reg.exe, which is typical of malware trying to maintain persistence on the system. Additionally, there are multiple file creation activities by PowerShell and winlogbeat.exe that could be related to setting up or modifying configurations. The combination of these indicators across different processes raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
