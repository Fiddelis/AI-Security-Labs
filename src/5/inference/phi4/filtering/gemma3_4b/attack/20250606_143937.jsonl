While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, it can be abused by malware to perform unauthorized actions, such as setting registry keys for persistence or privilege escalation. Therefore, this pattern warrants further investigation to determine if these are benign or indicative of an underlying threat. The confidence level is high due to the unusual behavior and potential security implications."}
