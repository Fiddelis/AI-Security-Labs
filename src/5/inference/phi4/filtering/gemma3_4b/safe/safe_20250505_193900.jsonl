{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' performing suspicious actions like setting registry values and creating pipes, along with an unusual updater process command line, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequent Network Connections**: Several events show `chrome.exe` making network connections. While this alone isn't suspicious, the frequency warrants attention.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple instances of `chrome.exe` setting registry values raise suspicion as malware often modifies the registry to ensure persistence or disable security measures.\n\n3. **Pipe Creation**: The creation of pipes by both `chrome.exe` and `updater.exe` can be indicative of inter-process communication, which is a common technique used in malicious software for command and control purposes.\n\n4. **Unusual Updater Process**: The presence of an updater process (`updater.exe`) with a detailed command line involving Crashpad suggests potential misuse or modification of legitimate software processes to hide malicious activities.\n\n5. **Image Load Event**: `chrome.exe` loading an image from `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll` could be benign if related to task scheduling, but it is unusual for a browser process and warrants further investigation.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests potential malicious behavior or compromise, thus classifying the batch as \"INTERESTING.\" The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple suspicious indicators without definitive proof of malicious intent."}
