Specifically, the creation, execution, and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1`) is suspicious as it suggests potential use for bypassing security controls or executing unauthorized scripts. Additionally, multiple `ImageLoad` events associated with `powershell.exe` loading various system DLLs could indicate an attempt to leverage legitimate processes for malicious purposes. The combination of these activities warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
