Multiple events involving `powershell.exe` accessing processes (`ProcessAccess`) and creating files. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but can be exploited for malicious purposes if misused.\n2. Use of `WMIC.exe`, which is often associated with remote code execution (RCE) attacks, loading images from critical system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `amsi.dll`, and `MpClient.dll`). This pattern could indicate an attempt to disable security mechanisms or execute unauthorized actions.\n3. The combination of these events shows patterns typically linked to reconnaissance or exploitation activities often seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n\nGiven these factors, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation due to its potential association with malicious behavior."}
