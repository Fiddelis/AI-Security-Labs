Additionally, `cmdkey.exe` is used to list credentials in memory, suggesting potential credential dumping. The repeated loading of the same file by different processes (`SDXHelper.exe`, `backgroundTaskHost.exe`) into `urlmon.dll` is uncommon and may signify an attempt at DLL injection or code execution. Overall, these events warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
