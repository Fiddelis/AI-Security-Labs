These include repeated use of scripts and commands in `powershell.exe` (e.g., `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, `gci -recurse`) which suggest enumeration or file exploration, creation and subsequent deletion of a script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1`), and loading of system DLLs that could be used to execute arbitrary code.
