The confidence level reflects the combination of unusual patterns and typical indicators of automated behavior that could be malicious."}

This could be part of normal operations, but given the context and pattern of file creation, it warrants further investigation.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries**: There are multiple entries for some files (e.g., two identical paths listed for certain files). This duplication suggests that the events might be automated or scripted rather than manual actions by a user.\n\n4. **Pattern of File Creation**: A significant number of similarly named files being created in quick succession could indicate an attempt to overload, manipulate, or exploit system resources, possibly through file-based attacks like DLL injection or script loading for remote code execution.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious Indicators**: Given the pattern and the lack of clear documentation or known benign use cases for `SDXHelper.exe`, these events are suspicious enough to be flagged as interesting for further investigation into potential malicious activities such as malware deployment, data exfiltration, or system compromise attempts.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 0.85 due to the strong indicators present, but recognizing that without additional context (such as system behavior post-creation or specific threat intelligence on `SDXHelper.exe`), there remains some uncertainty."}
