{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from `winlogbeat.exe` creating files and accessing the registry. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a legitimate tool used for collecting logs, so its activities are expected and usually benign.\n\nNext, there are several events involving `powershell.exe`. Powershell can be both a legitimate admin tool and abused by attackers. Looking closer, I see it's being executed multiple times with different command lines. The fact that it's accessing various system files like `mscoree.dll` and others might not raise red flags on their own since these are common operations.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell creates a file in the Temp directory named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`. Then, immediately after, it deletes that same file. This pattern is suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or to erase evidence of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell, which might indicate some initialization processes but don't necessarily mean anything nefarious. However, the combination with the file creation\/deletion in Temp is concerning.\n\nThe other events include network connections and registry changes by `ssh.exe` and `Explorer.EXE`, respectively. These seem more routine, especially since ssh is commonly used for remote access, and Explorer handling the registry isn't unusual.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated powershell activity, especially creating and deleting a script file quickly, stands out as potentially malicious behavior. This could be an indicator of script testing or attempting to execute unauthorized code. While some events are normal, this specific pattern suggests possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe activities including file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

That's a common system process, so it's not inherently suspicious. The task in each event is \"File created\", which suggests file creation activity.\n\nLooking at the file paths, the first event points to a directory: C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\XboxLive. The second event creates a specific file within that directory named AuthStateCache.dat. \n\nI know that svchost.exe can be associated with various services, including legitimate ones like Windows Update or Xbox Live services. Since these files are related to the Xbox Live configuration and authentication state cache, their creation is part of normal operation when an Xbox service runs.\n\nThere's nothing unusual in the file paths or the process name. No signs of known malicious activity like access to unexpected directories or writes to non-standard locations. The events don't show any attempts to execute files, modify system configurations, or interact with sensitive areas outside their expected scope.\n\nConsidering all this, these events are likely part of normal system operations, especially if there's an update or a service restart related to Xbox Live. Without indicators of compromise or anomalies, there's no reason to flag them as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show svchost.exe creating files in the XboxLive directory and its subfolder, which is a legitimate operation related to Xbox Live services.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
