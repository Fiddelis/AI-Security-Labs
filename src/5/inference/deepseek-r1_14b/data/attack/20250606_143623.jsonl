So first, all the events are in JSONL format, each with process, winlog, and file info.\n\nMost of them involve processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. The tasks are mostly about registry changes—either setting values or adding\/removing objects. Then there are a few file creation events from setup.exe, creating files and shortcuts for Microsoft Edge.\n\nI know that svchost.exe is a common system process, so seeing it modify the registry isn't unusual. Services.exe is related to Windows services, so registry activity there makes sense too. Setup.exe typically installs software, so creating files and shortcuts aligns with that.\n\nThe fact that all these events are from standard processes doing their regular tasks doesn't raise any red flags. There's no sign of unknown processes or unusual file accesses. The high number of similar events might just be part of a normal system operation, like installing updates or setting up services.\n\nSo putting it all together, I don't see any malicious behavior here.

I'm looking at a batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve 'powershell.exe' with tasks like ProcessAccess and ImageLoad. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in capabilities for system administration and can execute commands. The fact that there are multiple access and image load events suggests potential script execution, which could be malicious.\n\nOne event stands out: a FileCreate followed by a FileDeleteDetected of a .ps1 file. This temporary file might indicate PowerShell script execution trying to bypass policy checks or create persistence mechanisms. Such behavior is often red flag because scripts can be used for malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, the command line in one of the 'powershell.exe' events has some encoded content with \"New-Service\". Creating new services can be a way to establish persistence on a system, which is a common tactic in malware and attacks.\n\nLooking at other entries, there are several Registry value sets from both powershell.exe and services.exe. Modifying the registry can allow attackers to make persistent changes or elevate privileges, so this adds to the concern.\n\nWhile some events might be normal administrative tasks, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, script execution attempts, and registry modifications makes the entire batch suspicious. The repeated actions on 'powershell.exe' and the specific file operations increase my confidence that something malicious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with potential script execution and file manipulation activities, including creating and deleting temporary files, loading images, and modifying registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where the process is 'svchost.exe' and the task is a registry value set. Svchost is a common system process that hosts other services, so seeing it modifying the registry isn't unusual on its own. But when you have several instances of this activity in a row, it might be worth looking into if there's a pattern or an unexpected change.\n\nThen, I see events from 'setup.exe' creating files in various locations related to Microsoft Edge. This could be part of a legitimate update or installation process. However, the fact that multiple files are being created by setup.exe in specific paths makes me think—could this be part of malicious activity trying to install something stealthily? Or maybe it's just an expected update.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'RuntimeBroker.exe' setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is related to UWP app management, so that seems normal unless it's accessing unexpected areas or with unusual permissions.\n\nI also notice that some events are about image loading and file creation of system files like taskschd.dll. That could be part of legitimate process scheduling but might also indicate an attempt to load malicious libraries if not expected.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry modifications by svchost, which is a red flag because attackers often use it for persistence or other activities. The setup.exe creating several Edge-related files—could this be part of a payload installation? If these files are new and not part of an expected update, that's suspicious. Plus, the variety of tasks (registry writes, file creation) across different processes could indicate coordinated behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or other indicators, it's hard to say definitively. But the combination does raise some flags that merit closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and file creations by setup.exe in Edge-related paths suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first few entries mention 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various .NET framework files. That seems normal because those are standard DLLs used by applications running on the .NET framework. So, nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen there's an entry with 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. I know that PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, just creating a file here doesn't necessarily mean it's malicious; it could be part of a script or profile setup.\n\nNext, multiple events from 'services.exe' setting registry values. Services.exe is a system process responsible for managing services and the Service Control Manager. It's normal for this process to interact with the registry, so these entries might not indicate anything wrong on their own.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances where 'MsMpEng.exe' and various 'svchost.exe' processes are setting registry values. MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, which also interacts with the registry normally. Svchost.exe is a common host process for system services; many legitimate services run under it, so these entries don't raise red flags.\n\nThe last event shows a file creation by an unspecified process, but the path seems like part of Windows Update logs, which is standard.\n\nPutting it all together, each individual event appears to be within normal operating parameters. There's no evidence of overtly malicious activity such as multiple failed logins, unexpected file deletions, or known indicators of compromise. While some processes could potentially be used for nefarious purposes, the actions they're performing here are typical and don't suggest an attack.\n\nHowever, I'm considering if there's any unusual combination or frequency of events that might warrant closer inspection. For example, multiple registry changes by different processes might indicate configuration changes, but without context on what exactly was changed, it's hard to say. But given the data provided, each action is standalone and doesn't show a pattern of malicious behavior.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the events, I don't see any clear signs that the batch as a whole should be classified as interesting for investigation. Therefore, my conclusion is that this batch is not particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes interacting with standard files and registry entries without indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, most of the early events are all from setup.exe and involve registry changes. Setup.exe is typically used for installing software or making configuration changes, so some registry activity isn't unusual. But there are several instances where the task is 'Registry value set' and one where it's 'Registry object added or deleted'. That could be normal during an installation, but if these events happen outside of an install context, they might raise a flag.\n\nThen, towards the end, I see some Pipe Created events from setup.exe. Creating pipes can be part of inter-process communication, which is common, but in certain cases, it might indicate malicious activity like creating a backdoor for remote control.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple File created events from svchost.exe pointing to files in the Windows Temp directory and one in AppReadiness. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, so it's not inherently suspicious. However, creating several temporary files could be part of legitimate operations, but if they're not cleaned up or have unusual names, that might warrant closer look.\n\nI also notice that many events don't include file paths, which makes it harder to assess the context. Without knowing what these files contain or where they're being accessed from, it's hard to say if there's malicious intent.\n\nPutting this together: setup.exe making multiple registry changes and creating pipes, along with svchost.exe creating several temp files. While each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the sheer number of similar events could indicate something is off. Maybe a script or malicious process is running repeatedly to set up persistence or install components.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of registry changes and pipe creations from setup.exe, along with temp files created by svchost.exe, might suggest some kind of installation or activity that shouldn't be happening. However, without more context on what's normal for these processes, it's hard to be certain.\n\nSo, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not a clear sign of malicious activity yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include multiple registry modifications and pipe creations by setup.exe, as well as file creation activities by svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a JSON object with details about processes, Windows logs, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers. So, the presence of several events from this process could be significant. \n\nLooking at the tasks logged: there are Image loads, File creations, Pipe Created, and Process accesses. The files being accessed or created include paths like 'C:\\Windows\\Temp' and 'C:\\ProgramData', which might not be inherently suspicious on their own but when combined with PowerShell usage could indicate script execution or file manipulation.\n\nThere's also a process creation event for 'whoami.exe'. This tool is often used to gather user information, which can be part of reconnaissance activities. However, it's a common command and could just be legitimate use.\n\nOne notable point is the PowerShell command line: it's executing with an Execution Policy set to Restricted and running a script that checks INF files for specific patterns. This might indicate some automated checking or possibly attempting to bypass certain policies. The presence of multiple file creations in temporary directories like 'C:\\Windows\\Temp' suggests the creation of scripts, which could be part of malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or dropping malware components.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated loading of DLLs related to Windows Defender and .NET Framework might be red flags if these are being loaded by an unexpected process. PowerShell loading these could be normal for certain operations, but it's worth investigating if they're necessary for the script's function or if they indicate something more nefarious like lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a combination of activities that raise concern: multiple PowerShell instances, file creations in temporary directories, use of whoami.exe, and specific command-line arguments. These could be signs of malicious behavior, such as script testing, persistence setup, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances with suspicious activity including file creation in temporary directories and potential script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means one JSON object per line. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that many events are coming from svchost.exe creating files and also modifying registry values. SvcHost.exe is a common Windows process used by services, but it's often associated with malware because malicious actors can replace legitimate services to hide their activities. The file paths like 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WindowsApps\\\\Microsoft.Edge.GameAssist_1.0.3336.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\EdgeGameAssist.exe' seem normal at first glance, but I need to check if they're legitimate or not.\n\nWait a minute, the file paths in the first event look suspicious because Microsoft Edge Game Assist isn't something I'd expect to be created by svchost.exe. Usually, svchost.exe runs services which don't typically create files in the WindowsApps directory. Also, seeing multiple entries of the same file path from svchost.exe could indicate that it's trying to write or modify these files repeatedly, which might not be normal.\n\nThen there are several events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often use them to persistence their malware on the system. The fact that there are multiple such events makes me more cautious—it seems like svchost.exe is doing a lot of registry activity, which could be part of an infection process.\n\nNext, I notice that towards the end of the batch, powershell.exe is being executed with a command line: \"Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\". Using PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious. However, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which usually prevents script execution but allows certain commands. The fact that it's writing to the host might not seem suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it could indicate a larger issue.\n\nLooking deeper into the powershell.exe events, there are several ImageLoad events loading .NET framework components. This is normal when running PowerShell scripts because they often use .NET libraries. But I need to consider whether these loads are expected given the command being executed. The command here seems simple—outputting a message—but considering the earlier activities from svchost.exe, this could be part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe is making multiple file and registry changes that don't seem typical for legitimate services. Then powershell.exe runs with a specific command after these changes. This sequence might indicate a malicious process where svchost.exe is being used as a dropper or loader, perhaps deploying something via the registry and then using PowerShell to execute commands.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitely malicious, but the combination of suspicious file creations by svchost.exe, multiple registry writes, and a seemingly benign PowerShell command that could be part of an attack vector makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting. The confidence isn't super high because some events could be legitimate, but there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation and registry modification events from svchost.exe, along with a PowerShell execution, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Each event shows that 'Dism.exe' is the process and the Windows log indicates that an executable file was detected. The files involved are various DLLs related to providers like FolderProvider, MsiProvider, etc., all located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Microsoft tool used for servicing the operating system, such as installing updates or creating images. It typically extracts and loads these provider files when running operations. So seeing multiple file executions from Dism.exe isn't unusual during normal servicing activities.\n\nSince all events are coming from the same process and relate to standard DLLs associated with Dism's operation, there's no indication of malicious activity here. The repetition is likely part of a legitimate update or system maintenance routine.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell.exe being run, but the task is Image loaded. The file path points to MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender, so that's normal admin activity perhaps.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that looks like it's disabling Windows Defender features. The command uses Dism.exe, which I know can be used for enabling or disabling Windows features. This seems suspicious because attackers might try to disable defender to stop detection.\n\nThen another PowerShell event accessing a process without any file involved, so maybe just checking something.\n\nThe fourth event is Dism.exe creating a new process. The command line here is the same as in cmd.exe, which is trying to disable Defender. That's concerning because it's running system commands that could lower security.\n\nLooking at subsequent events, all of them involve Dism.exe accessing various files and executables. The file paths are all under Temporary folders with names like AppxProvider.dll and others. This seems like Dism is extracting or creating several components, which might be part of legitimate updates but also could indicate malicious activity if these files aren't supposed to be there.\n\nThe repetition of File Executable Detected events for the same files makes me think that something is being executed multiple times, maybe in a loop or during extraction. The temporary folder path looks random with GUID-like names (33BFE96B-A8C1...), which might be an attempt to avoid detection by using unique file names each time.\n\nI'm also noticing that all these files are .dll and .exe, which are executable types. Malware often drops such files into temp directories for execution or persistence. The fact that multiple DLLs with different prefixes (Appx, Assoc, Cbs, etc.) suggests they could be part of a payload being unpacked.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe is calling Dism to disable Defender, then Dism is creating numerous executables in a temp folder. This looks like an attempt to remove security features and execute malicious code. The combination of disabling defender and generating multiple suspicious files makes this batch highly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe executing potentially harmful commands, including disabling Windows Defender and creating numerous executable files in a temporary directory.

The process name in every event is Dism.exe, which I recognize as a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing operations like deploying and updating Windows. \n\nThe winlog field consistently mentions that it's detecting a File Executable via the rule FileExecutableDetected. This means that each of these events is logging the detection of an executable file being accessed or created.\n\nLooking at the files involved, all paths start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by various DLLs like SmiProvider.dll.mui and others. These seem to be temporary files stored in a standard Windows temp directory under a user profile. The naming conventions of these files suggest they are related to system components or possibly language resources, as indicated by \".mui\" extensions which are typically used for multi-language interface files.\n\nNow, considering the context: Dism.exe is known to process and manipulate system images, including extracting and managing these kinds of files during operations like Windows updates or deployments. The repeated detection of executable files might seem suspicious at first glance, but in this case, it's expected behavior when running Dism.exe as part of normal system administration tasks.\n\nI don't see any red flags here that would indicate malicious activity. There's no indication of unusual file names, paths outside the standard temp directory, or multiple failed attempts that could suggest brute force attacks. All the files are being handled by a legitimate process in a place where temporary files should be.\n\nTherefore, while each individual detection is noted, the combination doesn't raise concerns about malicious behavior.

The files being detected are all DLLs located in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various provider names like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc. So Dism.exe seems to be detecting these executable files.\n\nThen there's an entry where the process is \"DismHost.exe\" being created with a specific command line that includes a GUID: {3ED660F2-D9DD-43D4-B3AD-3464234FFF3A}. After that, several Image Load events from DismHost.exe load various DLLs from the same temporary directory.\n\nHmm. Dism.exe is typically part of the Windows Deployment Services and is used for image servicing. It's known to load provider DLLs when performing certain operations like OS deployment or system updates. The fact that multiple provider DLLs are being loaded seems normal in this context.\n\nThe command line for DismHost.exe includes a GUID, which might be related to a specific deployment task or session ID. This is common when dealing with large-scale deployments or custom scripts where unique identifiers are used to track operations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or indicators of compromise (IOCs). All the files are located in standard temporary directories and their names align with known Dism providers. The events are sequential and consistent with normal operation of these system tools during an imaging or deployment process.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

Let me try to parse through them step by step.\n\nFirst off, the events all seem to be related to file operations and process activities on a Windows system. The main processes involved are \"DismHost.exe\" and \"Dism.exe\". From what I remember, Dism is related to the Deployment Image Service, which is used in OS deployment and servicing. So it's part of Microsoft's tools for managing Windows images.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all show that DismHost.exe is loading image files from a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The file paths end with various .dll files like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. These are dynamic link libraries, which might be part of the Dism process's operations.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where DismHost.exe is terminating processes. That seems normal if it's part of the deployment or servicing tasks, as these might be cleanup steps after processing.\n\nNow, looking further down, I see that Dism.exe is logging file deletions from the same temporary directory. The files being deleted include various providers like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, and CbsProvider.dll. This could indicate that after some operations, the system is cleaning up these temporary files.\n\nI'm thinking about whether this behavior is typical or if it's something to be concerned about. Dism is a legitimate Windows tool, so its activities are expected during OS deployment or updates. The loading of multiple DLLs and subsequent deletions seem part of its normal operation, especially when dealing with image servicing where temporary files are created and then cleaned up after use.\n\nHowever, I should consider the context. If this activity occurs in an environment where Dism isn't being actively used for deployment or updates, it might be suspicious. Alternatively, if these events happen outside of a known update window, they could warrant further investigation. But based on the information provided without additional context, the activities described align with standard operations of the Dism tool.\n\nAlso, all the file deletions are logged and seem to follow a pattern—each one deletes a specific provider DLL from the same temp directory. There's no indication of any unauthorized access or unusual files being deleted beyond what's expected for cleanup after processing.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'd say there's a high likelihood that this is normal behavior because DismHost.exe and Dism.exe are known system processes involved in legitimate operations. The only reason to mark it as interesting might be if these events are occurring unexpectedly or outside the usual maintenance windows, but with the information given, there's no clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't see any red flags that would suggest this batch is indicative of malicious behavior. Therefore, the classification should probably be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of normal operations involving DismHost.exe and Dism.exe loading and cleaning up temporary files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each event has three components: process, winlog, and file. The process is always Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool—I remember that's a legitimate Windows system tool used for image-based deployment.\n\nThe winlog field indicates that there's a File Delete logged with the rule FileDeleteDetected. That suggests the system detected a file deletion event. The file path in each event is similar but varies by filename—like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, and so on. All these files are located in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp.\n\nSo what's happening here? Dism.exe deleting several DLL files from the temp folder. Now, I need to determine if this is normal or potentially malicious.\n\nDism.exe is known for performing tasks like deploying updates, creating restore points, and managing system images. During these operations, it might extract various components into temporary directories and then delete them after use. So seeing multiple file deletions from Dism.exe in a temp directory could be part of its standard process.\n\nBut why are there so many files being deleted? The list includes providers like GenericProvider.dll, ImagingProvider.dll, etc., which seem related to system setup and management. It's possible that Dism.exe is cleaning up after a recent deployment or update process.\n\nI should also consider if this activity is unusual in terms of frequency or timing. If these events are happening during an ongoing system update or installation, it would be normal. However, if they occur unexpectedly or outside of such contexts, it might warrant investigation.\n\nLooking at the structure, all events are similar and sequential, each deleting a different DLL from the same temp directory. There's no variation in the process name or other fields, which suggests consistency—a sign that this is part of Dism.exe's regular operation rather than varied malicious activities.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether these file deletions could be part of some attack vector. For example, deleting files might be a way for malware to remove evidence or disrupt operations. However, the fact that it's Dism.exe doing this makes me lean towards normal behavior because legitimate system processes often handle temporary files.\n\nI should also think about whether the temp directory is being used appropriately. Temporary files are common in many applications, and Windows tools like Dism.exe would naturally use such directories for their operations.\n\nTo be thorough, I could check if these file names correspond to known components used by Dism.exe. If they do, then it's definitely part of normal operation. If not, that might raise a red flag, but from the filenames provided, they seem like standard provider DLLs related to system deployment and management.\n\nIn summary, while the deletion of multiple files can sometimes indicate malicious activity, in this case, all signs point towards Dism.exe performing legitimate cleanup operations as part of its standard functionality. There's no evidence here suggesting unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows system tool that may delete temporary files during normal operation, such as cleaning up after deployment tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event, the command line is using PowerShell to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path and then starting it. That seems a bit concerning because creating services can be a way to maintain persistence on a system. The fact that it's being created via PowerShell might raise some flags.\n\nThe next set of events (from the second to the seventh) all show similar command lines where they're using Write-Host to output 'Final result: 1'. These are executed with different tasks in the Windows log, sometimes under \"Engine Lifecycle\" and others under \"Provider Lifecycle\". The use of -ExecutionPolicy Restricted suggests that PowerShell is running scripts with limited privileges, which might be an attempt to avoid detection or execute less malicious code. But seeing multiple identical commands could indicate a script being run multiple times, possibly testing something or trying different tasks.\n\nThen, there are events where the command line runs more complex PowerShell scripts. These scripts search through INF files in the Windows directory and check if they contain specific patterns related to installation sections. This kind of activity might be part of system discovery or checking for certain drivers. However, it's also a technique that could be used by attackers to gather information about the system or look for potential attack vectors.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are several red flags. The creation of a new service is potentially malicious, especially if it's not something standard. The repeated use of Write-Host commands might indicate testing or multiple attempts at different tasks. Additionally, parsing INF files could be part of an attack to look for vulnerabilities or to drop malware components.\n\nHowever, there are also elements that make me less certain. The fact that the scripts are using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted could mean they're trying to follow best practices or avoid raising too many alarms. Also, without more context on what these scripts are supposed to do, it's hard to say definitively if they're malicious.\n\nBut overall, the combination of creating a service and scanning system files seems suspicious enough that an investigator would want to look into this batch of events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell commands that could indicate malicious activity such as creating a new service and attempting to modify system configurations. The repeated commands and restricted execution policies suggest potential attempts at system compromise or persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: It shows a PowerShell command being executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command is checking for specific .inf files in the Windows directory and looking for certain patterns. This could be legitimate admin activity, but it might also indicate an attempt to detect or bypass certain security measures. I'm noting that as potentially suspicious.\n\nSecond event: Same as the first one. Identical command line and task. Could this mean multiple instances of the same script running? Maybe part of a larger process or trying different approaches.\n\nThird event: No process info, but it's about Security Group Management in Windows logs. This is common admin activity, probably not malicious on its own.\n\nFourth event: Services.exe executing with a logon task. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, so this is expected and likely not an issue.\n\nFifth event: Another Special Logon entry without a process. These are typically for background services or trusted processes, so nothing unusual here.\n\nPutting it all together, the first two events stand out because they involve PowerShell with restricted execution policy accessing sensitive files. While PowerShell is commonly used by admins, the specific command could be probing for vulnerabilities or trying to gather information about drivers (given the .inf files and defaultinstall.nt patterns). This might be part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack. The repetition adds concern as it suggests persistence or multiple attempts.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or other related events, it's hard to say definitively if these are malicious. But given the nature of the commands, I would classify this batch as interesting because they could indicate potential malicious activity that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell commands accessing system files which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSON data that's been provided. It seems to be a log of some kind, possibly from a system monitoring tool or something related to cybersecurity. The user has included a lot of entries here, and they've given me the task to figure out what's going on with them.\n\nFirst off, let's break down the structure of these logs. Each entry has three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". From the examples provided, it looks like each of these keys holds a dictionary or an object containing more specific information.\n\nStarting with the first log entry, I see that there's a long string under the \"event_id\" key. It seems to be a base64-encoded string because when I try to decode it, it doesn't make sense immediately. But upon closer inspection, maybe it's some kind of event data in XML format. Oh wait, if I take that base64 string and decode it, perhaps I can see an XML structure which might give more context about the system events.\n\nLooking at other entries, under \"process\", sometimes there's a process name like \"services.exe\" or \"svchost.exe\". These are common Windows processes, so they could be part of normal system operations. But then in some cases, the \"process\" is null, which probably means that either no process was involved or it wasn't captured.\n\nThe \"winlog\" key seems to detail the specific task or event that occurred. For example, there's a mention of \"Registry value set\", which indicates that something changed in the system registry. Then there are entries like \"Image loaded\", which suggests that a DLL or EXE file was loaded into memory. There's also a \"Provider Lifecycle\" task, which might relate to services being started or stopped.\n\nUnder the \"file\" key, sometimes there's a path provided, like \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll\". This indicates that this file was involved in an event, perhaps when it was loaded into memory. But in many cases, the \"file\" is null, meaning no specific file was associated with the event.\n\nLooking further down, I notice several entries where the process command line is a PowerShell script creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\". The script uses New-Service to create this service and Start-Service to start it. This is concerning because it could be an indicator of malicious activity. Creating services via PowerShell might be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nI also see repeated entries with similar command lines, which suggests that this script was run multiple times or as part of a loop. Each time, it's creating and starting the same service, which is a red flag for potential malware activity. The path mentioned in the BinaryPathName seems to point to an EXE file located at \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". This path looks suspicious because it's a long and somewhat unusual name, possibly indicative of a custom or malicious tool.\n\nThe mention of \"Windows Update Agent\" in one of the entries makes me think that perhaps this is part of legitimate system processes, but given the context with other entries, I'm cautious. It's possible that an attacker might masqueradeware as system components to avoid detection.\n\nI should also consider what these events could mean collectively. The combination of registry changes, service creations, and file loads could indicate that something is being installed or started on the system without proper authorization. Since some of these entries come from PowerShell, which is often used for scripting and automation but can also be abused for malicious purposes, it raises the alarm.\n\nI need to think about how I would analyze this data if I were in a cybersecurity role. My first step would be to decode those base64-encoded event IDs to see what detailed information they hold. If they're XML event logs, decoding them could reveal more context about each event, such as timestamps, process details, and other metadata.\n\nNext, I'd look into the processes listed. \"services.exe\" and \"svchost.exe\" are standard, but seeing multiple entries of creating a new service with a potentially malicious path is concerning. I would check if this service exists in the system and what it's doing by looking at its properties and startup type.\n\nThe file paths mentioned should be investigated as well. If \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file, I'd want to verify where it came from. A long and unusual path might indicate that it's stored deep within the filesystem, possibly dropped there by malicious software.\n\nI would also consider correlating these events with other logs around the same time period. For example, if this activity occurred after a known breach or attempt, it could be part of an attack chain. Checking network logs for any unusual traffic around when these processes ran might also provide clues.\n\nAnother angle is to look into how these services are being created and started. Using PowerShell's New-Service cmdlet isn't inherently malicious, but the context in which it's used matters. If this script doesn't have proper authorization or is running with elevated privileges, it could be a sign of privilege escalation.\n\nI should also think about potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). The file hashes of \"tarefa_logico.exe\" and any other files involved might be checked against known malware databases to see if they match anything. Additionally, the use of specific command-line arguments or the structure of the script could be telling signs.\n\nIn summary, while some entries here are part of normal system operations (like services.exe and svchost.exe running), the repeated use of PowerShell to create a service with a suspicious path is a red flag. This could indicate that an attacker has gained access to the system and is attempting to maintain persistence by creating malicious services.\n\nMy next steps would be to:\n\n1. Decode the base64-encoded event IDs to get more detailed information.\n2. Investigate each file mentioned for any signs of being malicious.\n3. Check if the \"objeto_ativo\" service exists and review its properties.\n4. Look into the user account under which these processes are running; if they're running with high privileges, that's concerning.\n5. Cross-reference these logs with other data sources to find a complete picture.\n6. Use threat intelligence feeds to see if any of the file hashes or domains related to known threats.\n\nBy systematically analyzing each part and correlating the information, I can determine whether this activity is indicative of a security breach and take appropriate action.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON logs indicate potential malicious activities on a system, with several red flags pointing towards possible unauthorized access or malware presence. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Malicious Service Creation:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts creating and starting a service named \"objeto_ativo\". The binary path points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`, which is suspicious due to the unusual file name and location.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Entries indicate registry values being set, suggesting potential changes to system configurations, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n3. **File Involvement:**\n   - The file `taskschd.dll` was loaded into memory, which is a known legitimate Windows component but worth monitoring if it's part of unauthorized processes.\n\n4. **Elevated Privileges and Persistence:**\n   - Creating services via PowerShell can be used for persistence. The repeated nature of these events suggests possible malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Decode Event IDs:**\n   - Decode base64-encoded event IDs to reveal detailed XML logs, aiding in understanding the context of each event.\n\n2. **Investigate Processes and Files:**\n   - Check if \"objeto_ativo\" service exists and review its properties. Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe` for malicious activity using antivirus scans or sandboxes.\n\n3. **Check User Account Privileges:**\n   - Determine under which user account these processes are running, especially if they have elevated privileges.\n\n4. **Correlate Logs:**\n   - Cross-reference with other logs to identify patterns and potential attack chains, such as those involving network traffic.\n\n5. **Threat Intelligence Check:**\n   - Verify file hashes against known malware databases to detect IoCs (Indicators of Compromise).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activities described are concerning, indicating possible unauthorized access and persistence mechanisms. System administrators should investigate these findings thoroughly, possibly with the aid of cybersecurity tools, to mitigate risks and ensure system integrity."}
