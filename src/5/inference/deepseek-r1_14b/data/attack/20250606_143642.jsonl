I'm looking at a series of events from the same process: powershell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is creating pipes, loading images, accessing processes, and files.\n\nI notice that some of the command lines in the logs show specific commands being executed by PowerShell. For example, one event has a command line that's querying INF files to check for certain patterns. That seems a bit suspicious because it looks like it's scanning for installation information, which could be part of malicious activity trying to gather system info or deploying drivers.\n\nAlso, there are file creations in the Windows Temp directory and references to DLLs loaded by PowerShell. While some of these might be normal, the combination—like multiple image loads and file operations—could indicate that something is being set up or executed.\n\nThe fact that it's using whoami.exe suggests an attempt to gather user information, which is common in attacks to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network. The use of restricted execution policies might be an attempt to run commands under certain constraints, but the other activities could bypass these restrictions.\n\nConsidering all these points together—suspicious file operations, command-line activity that looks like it's checking for specific system configurations, and elevated privileges—it seems like there's potential malicious behavior here.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at the JSONL data provided. \n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process name is 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. These can be common tools used by both legitimate users and attackers for command execution. The cmd.exe event has a command line that includes Dism with several parameters like disabling features and removing Windows Defender. That seems unusual because Dism (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) is typically used for servicing Windows images, not something a regular user would run.\n\nThen there are multiple events from 'Dism.exe' accessing various files in a temporary directory. The paths look like they're creating or accessing DLLs and other executables. This could be part of a legitimate system update process, but the combination of running Dism with specific parameters to disable Windows Defender and then accessing these files might indicate something malicious. Disabling defender could lower the system's security, which is a red flag.\n\nThe events show file creation and executable detection for multiple files in a temporary folder. This could be part of legitimate software installation or updates, but the fact that it's combined with disabling defender makes me suspicious. Attackers often try to remove or disable antivirus before deploying malware.\n\nI'm also noticing that there are several instances where Dism.exe is accessing these files, which might be part of unpacking or extracting components as part of a malicious payload. The repeated FileExecutableDetected events could mean the system is flagging these files as potential threats, which adds to the concern.\n\nPutting it all together: using cmd and powershell to execute Dism with commands that disable Windows Defender, followed by creating multiple executable files in a temp directory. This sequence looks like an attacker trying to remove security measures before deploying malware components. So, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe accessing and creating files, combined with disabling Windows Defender via cmd.exe and powershell.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. They all seem to be related to processes involving Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The events mention things like executable detection, process creation, and image loading. The file paths are all under the same temporary directory, which suggests it's part of a single operation.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the operating system, like deploying or configuring updates. It's common for it to load various DLLs as part of its operations. These events don't show any signs of unusual behavior, such as multiple failed attempts, access from unknown sources, or interactions with restricted areas.\n\nThe repeated File Executable Detected events are probably just the system monitoring normal activity. Since all these actions align with what Dism and DismHost are supposed to do, there's no red flag here.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. All the events have the same process name, which is \"Dism.exe\". The winlog field consistently mentions that a file executable was detected, specifically pointing out the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". The file paths all lead to different .dll.mui files located in the same temporary directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nFirst, I recognize that Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used for deploying and updating Windows operating systems. So it's a legitimate system process. However, seeing multiple instances of this process detecting executable files might raise some flags because it's unusual unless it's part of the normal operation during deployment or updates.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all end with .dll.mui, which suggests they are language-specific resources for DLLs. These files are typically used for internationalization and localization in Windows. The fact that multiple such files are being accessed by Dism.exe might be part of a legitimate process, like extracting or updating localized resources during an installation or servicing operation.\n\nBut the combination of multiple file executable detections from the same process could indicate something suspicious. Maybe the system is trying to execute these files, which shouldn't happen if they're just resource files. Alternatively, it could be that an attacker is using Dism.exe as a vector to execute malicious code by masquerading it as legitimate activity.\n\nI also notice that all the file paths are in the same temporary directory. Temporary directories can be risky because they might not have strict access controls and could be used to store malicious files temporarily before execution. The presence of multiple .dll.mui files suggests this might be part of a larger payload being unpacked or loaded by Dism.exe.\n\nConsidering that each event is identical except for the specific file path, it seems like a pattern of activity rather than isolated incidents. This repetition could be part of an automated process attempting to deploy malicious software components under the guise of legitimate system operations.\n\nI should also think about whether this kind of activity is typical during normal system operations. Dism.exe often deals with servicing updates and can extract various files, including DLLs. However, it's less common for it to trigger file executable detections on so many different files in quick succession unless there's something being unpacked or executed beyond just resource extraction.\n\nAnother angle is the use of MUI files. These are not typically executed as standalone executables; they're used by other processes as resources. So if Dism.exe is detecting them as executables, it might indicate that someone is attempting to execute these files directly, which could be malicious.\n\nTaking all this into account, the batch shows multiple instances of an legitimate process (Dism.exe) triggering file executable detections on non-standard files in a temporary directory. While this doesn't conclusively prove malicious activity, it does raise concerns about potential exploitation or misuse of Dism.exe for executing unauthorized code.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Dism.exe detecting executable files in a temporary directory suggest potential suspicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to see if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are from DismHost.exe loading various DLL files into memory. The paths all point to the same temporary directory, which is standard for some processes to use temp files. Each event shows different providers being loaded—like IBSProvider.dll, DmiProvider.dll, etc. Loading multiple DLLs isn't unusual, especially during setup or configuration tasks.\n\nThen, there's an event where DismHost.exe terminates. That seems normal too; processes usually start and stop as needed.\n\nAfter that, the logs switch to Dism.exe deleting files. It deletes several DLLs from the same temp directory, like AppxProvider.dll and others. Deleting temporary files after they're used is a common practice, so this doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these actions are part of normal system operations. Dism (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tools are often used for servicing Windows images, including installing, updating, or removing features. These operations would involve loading various provider DLLs during the servicing process and then cleaning up by deleting them once done.\n\nAnother point is that all these events happen in a sequence: loading, using, then deleting. This pattern aligns with how legitimate software handles temporary files to avoid clutter and potential security risks from leaving unnecessary files around.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any indication of malicious behavior. Malware often tries to stay hidden or persistent, but here the actions are straightforward—loading and then removing files. There's no evidence of unusual process names, file persistence mechanisms, or irregular access patterns beyond what's expected from Dism operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem consistent with normal Windows servicing activities. The batch doesn't show any signs of suspicious or malicious behavior. Therefore, I would classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the actions are typical and don't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate normal Windows servicing operations involving DismHost.exe loading provider DLLs followed by their deletion by Dism.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event involving the process \"Dism.exe\". \n\nThe first thing that stands out is that almost all these events are related to file deletions. The same executable name keeps recurring, and multiple files under the same temporary directory path are being deleted. It's a bit concerning because Dism.exe is typically associated with system deployment or disk management tools, not something you'd expect to see deleting many files in quick succession.\n\nI also notice that one of the events isn't a deletion but a change in file creation time. That might be suspicious on its own, as attackers often alter timestamps to avoid detection. But combined with all the deletions, it raises an eyebrow. \n\nThe path structure seems off too. The files are located in a temporary directory within the user's AppData folder. Temporary files can be legitimate, but having multiple DLLs and MUI (multi-language interface) files being deleted might indicate something malicious, like a cleanup routine after dropping some files.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether this activity is normal for Dism.exe. From what I know, Dism.exe usually deals with image servicing and can create or delete files during deployment processes. But seeing it delete so many specific files in the same directory might not be typical. It could be part of a legitimate process, but given the context of multiple deletions and timestamp changes, there's a chance it's something more nefarious.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of these events. If this happened over a short period, it might suggest an automated script or malware trying to remove evidence. On the other hand, if it's spread out, maybe it's part of regular operations.\n\nThe confidence level is tricky. While there are red flags, without more context like timestamps or additional logs, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of file deletions and a timestamp change from the same process, I'd lean towards interesting but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe targeting various files in a temporary directory could indicate suspicious activity. The combination of deletions and a timestamp change may suggest an attempt to remove traces of prior actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is something I should look into. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries. Each line has three main parts: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, the process name is always 'Dism.exe'. I remember that Dism is related to Windows deployment and servicing. It's used for installing, configuring, and updating Windows. So it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every entry says it's a File Delete logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. That means the system detected a file deletion event. Not unusual on its own since the OS logs these events regularly.\n\nNow, looking at the files being deleted: all paths start with 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\en-US\\' followed by various .dll.mui files. The last one is 'FfuProvider.dll'. These seem like temporary files or language-specific resources. \n\nI know that when you install software or update Windows, the system creates temp files and cleans them up after. Dism.exe might be part of the cleanup process during an OS deployment or servicing operation. So deleting these .dll.mui files could just be normal cleanup.\n\nBut wait, why so many deletions? Each entry deletes a different file, but all under the same temporary directory. That makes sense if Dism is handling multiple components or providers, each with their own resource files. It's not unusual for such processes to generate and delete several temp files in one go.\n\nIs there any red flag here? The paths look legitimate, no signs of user folders or personal data being accessed. Also, all events are from the same process and related task, so it doesn't seem like a spread-out attack vector.\n\nI should consider if Dism.exe is known for such behavior. From what I know, during Windows updates or deployments, Dism can perform file operations, including deletions. So this batch could just be part of a routine update or deployment process.\n\nAnother angle: the number of events. There are 14 entries, each deleting a different .dll.mui file. It's possible that these files were created during some operation and are now being cleaned up en masse. Since they're in a temporary directory, this is a common practice to avoid cluttering system directories with unnecessary files.\n\nCould it be something malicious? Malware often tries to stay under the radar, so multiple deletions might be suspicious. However, in this case, the process is legitimate, and the files are temp files. Unless there's evidence that Dism.exe was compromised, which isn't indicated here, I don't see a reason to flag it as malicious.\n\nI should also think about confidence level. Since all events fit within expected behavior for Dism.exe during cleanup, my confidence that this is not interesting is high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe targeting temporary .dll.mui files suggest normal system cleanup during deployment or servicing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, I'm looking at this batch of events where each line is a JSON object. Each event has three main parts: process, winlog, and file.\n\nThe process name in all these events is Dism.exe. From what I remember, Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Service Manager. It's a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating system images. So, it's usually not malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every single event has the same task: 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. This suggests that each of these events is logging a file deletion. The rule being referenced is specific to detecting such deletions.\n\nNow, the file paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by various .dll files. The filenames vary but they all end with .dll and seem related to different providers—like FolderProvider.dll, GenericProvider.dll, etc. These look like temporary files created during some installation or configuration process.\n\nSince Dism.exe is known for handling OS images and possibly deploying updates or changes, it's plausible that it's cleaning up after itself by deleting these temporary DLL files. Temporary files are often deleted once they're no longer needed to free up disk space or prevent them from causing issues if accessed again.\n\nI don't see any anomalies here because all the events are consistent in terms of the process name and the type of log entry. There's no indication that Dism.exe is behaving out of its usual role, nor are there signs like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or deletions outside its normal operation.\n\nAlso, considering the number of files being deleted—each one a different provider DLL—it aligns with standard cleanup procedures after an image servicing operation. It's possible that these DLLs were extracted during some process and are now no longer needed, hence Dism.exe is removing them.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure this isn't malicious because I can't find any evidence pointing towards suspicious behavior from Dism.exe in this context. All the actions described fit within its expected functionality.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file deletions by Dism.exe, a standard Windows tool, during cleanup operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. The first few entries show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating files, which could be normal script execution.\n\nThen there's a command line where powershell.exe runs with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. This might indicate some user executing scripts but since it's restricted, it's less likely to be malicious. However, the actual commands are worth looking at.\n\nI notice that several events have the same command-line arguments, including checking for specific patterns in .inf files and writing a result. This behavior seems like it could be part of a legitimate script or maybe an attempt to check system configurations. But I'm concerned because some of these actions can be used by attackers to determine if they're on a virtual machine or analyze system info.\n\nThe fact that multiple events repeat the same command suggests this might be part of a larger script execution, possibly for reconnaissance. While it's not overtly malicious, such behavior could be indicative of adversarial activity trying to gather information about the system.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while some activities are normal, others like the repeated command and checking .inf files raise flags that need further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell.exe instances with restricted execution policies and commands that check system information, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let's see what they're all about. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at each event, most of them involve powershell.exe commands. The first few events have a command that checks for specific patterns in .inf files located in the Windows directory. They’re using Get-Item and Get-Content, which seems legitimate but could be malicious if the pattern matching is looking for something bad. However, since it's just checking for certain sections in INF files, maybe it's part of some system configuration or analysis.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is used to remove files from the Temp directory. The command is Remove-Item targeting *.entrada_principal.zip files and using -Force to delete without prompting. This catches my attention because deleting specific files could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if they're trying to cover their tracks or remove evidence.\n\nI notice that in some events, the winlog task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and in others it's 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what each of these means, but perhaps they relate to different parts of Windows service management. If multiple events have similar commands but slightly different log tasks, it might be part of a process spread across different system components.\n\nAlso, looking at the command lines, some are using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted which is common for safe scripts, but others don't specify that parameter. The file field in these events is 'None', so no additional file info is provided beyond the command line.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has two types of activities: one scanning INF files and another deleting specific ZIP files from Temp. While scanning system files isn't inherently malicious, deleting files without a clear reason might be suspicious. The fact that multiple events are doing similar things across different log tasks could indicate some automated process or potential malicious activity trying to remove traces.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is normal behavior, so I'd lean towards classifying it as INTERESTING because the file deletion part stands out and there's repetition in commands which might be worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to delete specific files in the Temp directory, potentially indicating efforts to remove evidence or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to understand this cybersecurity log data. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to processes being created or accessed. For example, 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are known system processes, so their activity might not be suspicious on its own. But I should note that these were involved in registry value sets. Maybe they're part of normal operations, but it's worth checking if any unusual changes were made.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from 'powershell.exe'. It was created with a command line argument that removes a specific file: Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force. That caught my attention because deleting files can be part of malicious activities, especially if the file name seems suspicious. The fact that it's trying to remove a .zip file in the Temp directory might indicate an attempt to clean up evidence.\n\nLooking at the file operations, 'powershell.exe' loaded several DLLs, which is normal for script execution. However, the specific DLL paths should be checked against known malware indicators. For instance, if any of these DLLs are associated with malicious activities or if their versions don't match expected ones, that could be a red flag.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1. Temporary script files might be part of testing or legitimate operations, but the deletion after creation is something to look into. It could mean the script didn't run properly, or it was a way to hide evidence.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' has had some activity here. If this account isn't supposed to perform certain actions, especially administrative ones, that's worth investigating. Maybe their credentials were compromised, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nI should also consider the timeline of these events. Are they spread out or happening in quick succession? The fact that several processes and file operations happened within a short time frame might indicate a coordinated attack.\n\nLooking at the command lines, 'whoami.exe' was run without any arguments, which is a common way to check user privileges. If this wasn't expected, it could mean someone tried to find out who's logged in.\n\nPutting all this together, there are signs that suggest potential unauthorized activity, possibly involving PowerShell scripts and attempts to delete files or alter system configurations. I need to verify each of these actions against known baseline activities for the system. Any deviation from normal behavior should be flagged and investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate potential unauthorized activity on the system, particularly involving the use of PowerShell to execute commands and manipulate files. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Process Creation and Activity:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were created. Notably, one instance executed a command that attempted to delete specific files in the Temp directory (`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`). This could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or malicious files.\n   - The process `whoami.exe` was also created, which might have been used to gather system information.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) was created and then deleted. This could suggest that a malicious script was executed and subsequently removed to avoid detection.\n   - Attempts were made to delete files in the Temp directory, which is a common tactic by malware to clean up traces of their activity.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Processes like `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` modified registry values. While these are legitimate system processes, unusual modifications could indicate malicious activity aiming to persistence or alter system configurations.\n\n4. **User Account Activity:**\n   - The user account \"fiddelis\" was involved in these activities. If this account wasn't supposed to perform such actions, it might suggest unauthorized access or credential compromise.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual PowerShell Activity:** The execution of PowerShell with specific commands is a common vector for attacks.\n- **File Deletion Attempts:** Deleting files in the Temp directory might be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities.\n- **Registry Changes:** Unexplained registry modifications could indicate attempts at persistence or system configuration changes.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate Process Logs:**\n   - Review all instances where `powershell.exe` was executed, focusing on command-line arguments and scripts used.\n   \n2. **Check File Activity:**\n   - Ensure that the creation and deletion of temporary files are legitimate. Look for patterns or additional logs related to these operations.\n\n3. **Analyze Registry Changes:**\n   - Determine if the registry modifications by `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` were legitimate or part of malicious activities.\n\n4. **Review User Activity:**\n   - Confirm whether user \"fiddelis\" should have performed the actions logged. If not, it may indicate a compromised account.\n\n5. **Monitor for Further Activity:**\n   - Keep an eye on similar patterns in future logs to detect potential recurrence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consider Malware Analysis:**\n   - If suspicious files were deleted or created, consider analyzing remnants or checking for known malware indicators.\n\nBy carefully reviewing these points and cross-referencing with baseline system behavior, you can better determine if the system has been compromised."}
