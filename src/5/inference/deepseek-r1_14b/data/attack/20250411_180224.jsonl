{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's from winlogbeat.exe and mentions a file creation event for .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like part of the normal operation since Winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs. So probably nothing malicious here.\n\nNext, there are three events involving powershell.exe. The second event shows a file being created named entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks, so this could be suspicious. Maybe it's creating a new script or config file.\n\nThe third and fifth events show ProcessAccess task for powershell.exe without a specific file path. Accessing processes can be part of legitimate operations but also might indicate an attempt to interact with other running processes, which is often seen in malicious activities like lateral movement.\n\nThe fourth event is whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is used to check user permissions and sometimes by attackers to verify their privileges. The command line seems normal, but the fact that it's being run alongside powershell.exe might raise some flags if the context isn't clear.\n\nPutting this all together: There are multiple instances of powershell.exe activity with file creation and process access events, along with whoami.exe. While each event on its own might not be conclusive, the combination could indicate potential malicious behavior, especially since powershell is often used in attacks for obfuscation or command execution. However, without more context like timestamps or additional events showing other suspicious activities (like network communications or credential dumping), it's hard to be certain. \n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the elevated use of powershell and whoami.exe together, but my confidence isn't too high since there could be benign explanations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with file creation and process access may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell is being run with a command that tries to access 'C:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'. That script name looks suspicious because it's using terms like \"NonExistingScript\", which might indicate an attempt to execute something malicious. Also, the use of \"-ep bypass\" in the command line stands outâ€”this is a common technique to avoid detection by PowerShell's execution policies.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are used with similar commands. Schtasks is being used to create scheduled tasks that run PowerShell scripts. This could be part of an attempt to establish persistence on the system since scheduled tasks can execute at regular intervals. The fact that these tasks are named 'win32times' and use a command line that tries to bypass execution policies makes me think this is not just normal user activity.\n\nThen, there's svchost.exe making several registry changes. SvcHost is often used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware. The repeated Registry value sets could be setting up persistence or altering system configurations maliciously. Also, one of the svchost processes creates a file in the Windows Tasks directory, which might be part of creating a new scheduled task.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where Chrome is making registry changes. While Chrome does make some registry writes during normal operation, this many entries could be suspicious. It's unusual for a browser to make so many Registry modifications, especially if they're all related or follow a pattern.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file and another where PowerShell creates 'estrutura_geral.txt'. These might not seem malicious at first glance, but combined with the other activities, they could be part of exfiltration or establishing additional persistence points. The naming of these files doesn't immediately ring alarm bells, but in the context of all these events together, it's worth noting.\n\nPutting this all together, the sequence shows several red flags: multiple attempts to run PowerShell scripts with bypass flags, scheduled task creations using schtasks.exe, registry modifications by svchost.exe and cmd.exe, and unusual Chrome activity. These behaviors collectively suggest a potential malicious campaign, possibly involving persistence mechanisms, file creation for unknown purposes, and system configuration changes.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.85 that this batch is interesting because the combination of these events points towards potentially harmful activities rather than normal user behavior or standard software operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious activities such as attempts to execute PowerShell scripts with bypass flags, creation of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe, and registry modifications by svchost.exe. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
