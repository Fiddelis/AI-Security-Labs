{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries related to `chrome.exe` with network connection detections. That could be normal user activity, especially if the user is browsing the web. But then again, too many connections might raise an eyebrow, but not necessarily red flags yet.\n\nNext, there are several processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Notepad accessing registry values isn't typical, but it's possible for legitimate tasks. Powershell being used without any unusual command lines seems okay here, though I know it's often targeted by attackers, so that could be a point to watch.\n\nLooking at the events involving `calc.exe` and `cmd.exe`, especially with command lines that create scheduled tasks executing calc.exe on startup or logon. That's concerning because creating new scheduled tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that multiple schtasks.exe processes are involved in creating these tasks is a red flag.\n\nThe use of `svchost.exe` setting registry values and creating files in Task directories is another point to note. While svchost is a legitimate process, it's often used by malware to hide activities. The multiple RegistryEvent entries and FileCreate events here might indicate some malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated attempts to create scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe that execute calc.exe are indicative of potential malicious behavior. This could be part of an attempt to maintain persistence on the system by ensuring the payload runs at startup or logon. The combination of these activities across different processes suggests a possible attack vector rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving schtasks.exe creating scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity. Additionally, there are several RegistryEvent and FileCreate events from svchost.exe, which could be signs of persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. That might be normal since many system processes interact with the registry. However, repeated registry writes can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially if they're done by non-system processes.\n\nNext, I notice a lot of events from chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome is a legitimate application, but it's unusual for it to make so many registry changes in one session. This could be something suspicious because browsers typically don't modify the registry that frequently unless there's some malicious script or extension being loaded.\n\nLooking further down, I see winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool used for log management, but if it's writing to unexpected locations, especially in user directories, it might be worth looking into—though it's more likely just normal operation.\n\nThere are also some ImageLoad events from chrome.exe loading legitimate DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard system files, so nothing unusual there.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file named unidade_ativo.txt in the user's downloads folder. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. Creating a file directly might be benign, but it's worth monitoring, especially if combined with other actions like registry modifications or process access events.\n\nI also see ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Accessing processes can be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with other activities, it might indicate malicious behavior, such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nFinally, whoami.exe is run from the command line without any arguments. Whoami is a standard tool to display user information, so this could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker trying to gather system details.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple processes making registry changes, especially chrome.exe doing it numerous times, plus powershell.exe creating files and accessing other processes—these are red flags. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, like a script or tool being executed that's attempting persistence or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including chrome.exe making numerous registry changes and powershell.exe creating files and accessing other processes may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
