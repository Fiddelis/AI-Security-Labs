{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial events involve powershell.exe executing some commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines are using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which is a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. These scheduled tasks are set to run at logon with high privileges, targeting the Administrators group. That's concerning because it indicates an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. Registry modifications can be part of installing malware or configuring persistence mechanisms, so these actions are suspicious. The fact that this happens several times suggests a possible script running multiple commands.\n\nLooking further, some events show powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While PowerShell does use these libraries legitimately, the combination with other activities makes me cautious. It's hard to say without more context, but unusual image loads could be indicators of malicious behavior.\n\nThere are also entries from chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying registry values. Chrome is a common application, so while it can have legitimate reasons for such actions, multiple instances or patterns might warrant closer inspection.\n\nHowever, the most concerning part is the repeated use of powershell.exe to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges. This behavior aligns with techniques used in persistence and lateral movement within an attack. The command-line arguments show that each task is being registered under a different name (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral), which could be an attempt to avoid detection or blocklisting of specific task names.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activity involving powershell.exe and registry modifications. The repeated attempts to create high-privilege scheduled tasks are a strong indicator of possible compromise. While some events might have benign explanations, the overall pattern suggests a security incident that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` being executed with command-line arguments. This is notable because PowerShell can execute arbitrary commands and is often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The arguments involve creating scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`. These tasks are set to run at logon (`-AtLogon`) with high privileges (`-RunLevel Highest`). This behavior is suspicious as attackers often use such techniques for persistence.\n\n3. **Check for Privilege Escalation:**\n   - The scheduled tasks target the `BUILTIN\\Administrators` group, indicating they will run with elevated permissions. This could allow an attacker to maintain persistence and escalate privileges.\n\n4. **Look for Registry Modifications:**\n   - Events show `powershell.exe` accessing processes and setting registry values. These actions can be part of installing malware or configuring systems for malicious purposes.\n\n5. **Examine Image Load Events:**\n   - PowerShell loads several .NET framework components, which is normal, but the frequency and combination with other activities warrant attention. Malicious scripts may load legitimate libraries for obfuscation.\n\n6. **Review Other Applications' Activities:**\n   - Entries from `chrome.exe` show pipe creation and registry modifications. While Chrome can perform these actions legitimately, they could also be part of malicious activity if there's an unusual pattern or frequency.\n\n7. **Assess the Overall Pattern:**\n   - The repeated attempts to create scheduled tasks under different names suggest a potential attempt to bypass detection mechanisms or avoid blocklisting specific task names.\n\n8. **Determine the Likelihood of Compromise:**\n   - Given the combination of high-privilege task creation, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell usage, it is likely that the system has been compromised, possibly through an attack involving persistence and lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion:** The batch indicates a potential security incident where malicious actors are using powershell.exe to establish persistence on the system. Immediate action should be taken to investigate and remediate these findings."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. There are a lot of entries here, so I need to go through them carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for legitimate purposes but can also be abused by attackers. For example, one event shows powershell.exe being used with a command line argument that includes creating scheduled tasks. Specifically, the command creates a task that runs calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This seems suspicious because it could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThere are also several events where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories by powershell.exe. The paths look legitimate, but paired with other actions, this might be part of a larger malicious script execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of Registry value sets from chrome.exe. While Chrome can modify the registry for things like extensions or settings, multiple such events without any context could be normal user activity, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe most concerning part is towards the end where there are several entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task, all marked as None for process and file. This stands out because it indicates some form of remote execution activity without associated files or processes, which could be indicative of command-line attacks or remote code execution.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of suspicious PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks and multiple execute a Remote Command events makes this batch quite concerning. There's potential for malicious activity here, so further investigation is definitely warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution attempting to create scheduled tasks with calc.exe and numerous remote command executions, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's an entry from WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which often loads system-related DLLs. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process that hosts various services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. However, the frequency might be worth notingâ€”there are several such events in a row. Maybe it's part of normal service operations or could indicate something more.\n\nThen, another svchost.exe event shows a file creation under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. That path is standard for task scheduler files, so this seems legitimate unless the filename looks suspicious. The name \"unidade_comum\" translates to \"common unit,\" which doesn't immediately raise alarms but could be part of some localized configuration.\n\nLooking further down, there are two events where a remote command is executed without any associated process or file. This catches my attention because executing remote commands can be risky and often linked to malicious activities like remote code execution. The lack of context here makes me question the legitimacy of these actions.\n\nPowershell.exe appears a few times. It's a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious purposes. One event creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory, which is normal. Another creates files named 'entrada_principal.txt' and 'objeto_auxiliar.txt', which are generic names. Without more context on their contents, it's hard to say, but using Powershell alongside other activities might be worth monitoring.\n\nThere are multiple Chrome.exe entries setting registry values. Chrome often writes to the registry for settings, so this alone isn't concerning. However, combined with the remote command executions and the powershell activity, it adds to the noise but doesn't necessarily indicate malicious behavior on its own.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating files in a standard location for its data. That's expected if the system is running the winlogbeat service, so no issues there.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows normal activities like process executions and file creations typical of Windows operation. However, the two remote command executions are concerning as they could be signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity. Additionally, while the powershell and chrome activities aren't inherently suspicious, their combination with other events might warrant further investigation.\n\nI'm on the fence because some activities are normal, but others could indicate potential threats. The confidence level isn't very high since not all events are clearly malicious, but there's enough unusual behavior to merit attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential suspicious activities such as remote command execution and file creations with unclear purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
