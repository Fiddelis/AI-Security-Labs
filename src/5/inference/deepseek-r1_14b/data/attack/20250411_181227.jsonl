{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set\". Chrome often interacts with the registry, so these might be normal activities, like extensions or settings changes. Not immediately suspicious unless they occur at unusual times or in large numbers, but here it's eight instances, which could be a bit much but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe made a DNS query. That seems standard too; browsers do that regularly when navigating to websites. Nothing unusual here.\n\nNext up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so it makes sense for it to create configuration files. This doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe created an object_auxiliary.txt file in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. The creation of a text file could be part of data gathering or exfiltration. Malware might use this to store information, so this event catches my attention more.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, while most events are benign, the powershell.exe activity stands out as potentially malicious. It's combined with the high number of registry writes by chrome.exe, which could indicate something fishy, but individually they aren't conclusive. However, when considering the overall context, especially the PowerShell activity, it's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe and a FileCreate event from powershell.exe creating an arbitrary file in the Downloads directory, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. I need to analyze all these together rather than per event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being executed with command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction, which suggests they're setting up tasks to run on startup. The actions point to calc.exe, which is usually benign but could be a way to execute malicious code if combined with other behaviors.\n\nThe 'winlog' field in these events mentions 'Provider Lifecycle', which relates to Windows task management and scheduling. This seems relevant because creating scheduled tasks can be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nThen there are events where PowerShell.exe accesses processes, reads or writes registry values, and loads images like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These actions aren't inherently malicious but could be indicators if they're done in a way that's unusual for the environment. For example, accessing certain registry keys or loading specific DLLs might be part of legitimate operations, but repeated access could raise flags.\n\nI also notice that there are events from Chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing the registry. These seem less concerning on their own but should be considered in the broader context. Since they're not as common as PowerShell activities, maybe they're just normal user actions.\n\nThe key points here are multiple instances of PowerShell creating scheduled tasks, use of elevated privileges (BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest), and repeated interactions with system processes and registries. These behaviors can be signs of persistence or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of these activities—especially the scheduled task creations and the registry access by PowerShell—raises concerns about potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is setting up a persistent backdoor using these tasks, which would make this batch highly relevant for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe actions and accessing system processes\/registries, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of events in JSONL format, each representing different system activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all have the same 'winlog' task: \"Execute a Remote Command\". That seems suspicious because executing remote commands could be part of malicious activity like remote code execution. But wait, maybe it's legitimate traffic? I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe is used to create a scheduled task named 'unidade_comum' that executes calc.exe at logon. That stands out because Powershell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges might indicate something is off—maybe persistence mechanisms?\n\nNext, I see WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WMI is commonly used in attacks, so this could be part of malicious activity. There are multiple registry writes by svchost.exe, which is another red flag because svchost can be a common process for both legitimate services and malware.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file 'unidade_comum' under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks, which I think should only have system-generated files. So that's concerning—maybe persistence or dropping malicious code there.\n\nThere are also some events from Chrome loading DLLs and registry writes, but those might be normal as browsers interact with system libraries and tracking.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a config file is probably okay since it's an agent for log management.\n\nPowershell.exe creating 'entrada_principal.txt' could be writing to files in user directories, which if not explained, might be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple remote command executions, Powershell creating scheduled tasks with admin rights, WMI activity, registry writes by svchost, and file creation in system32\\Tasks. These are indicators that could point towards malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or backdooring.\n\nI'm pretty confident this batch is interesting for investigation because the combination of these activities isn't typical user behavior and aligns with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including remote command executions, suspicious Powershell usage creating scheduled tasks, WMI process loading, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My job is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and decide whether it's worth investigating.\n\nLooking through the first few events, I notice that there are several instances where powershell.exe is involved. Specifically, there are ImageLoad tasks for various DLL files. That in itself isn't too concerning because PowerShell is commonly used, but the paths mentioned like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll seem legitimate as part of .NET framework.\n\nThen, I see two events related to a file being created and then deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file might be an attempt to avoid detection or execute malicious code. It could indicate that something was run in memory or that the script was deleted after execution.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task. The command executes calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. This is concerning because creating a persistent task with admin rights could be part of a persistence mechanism for malware. It suggests that someone or something is trying to maintain access on the system.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry, multiple such events might indicate unusual activity, especially if they're not related to normal browser operations. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just part of legitimate updates or extensions.\n\nThe latter part of the log shows several entries where the process field is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This is worrying because it implies that something is executing commands remotely, which could be signs of remote access or command-and-control activities. Without knowing what's triggering these commands, it raises red flags about potential unauthorized access.\n\nPutting all this together: there are multiple indicators pointing towards potential malicious activity. The creation and deletion of a script file, the scheduled task execution with admin rights, and numerous remote command executions suggest that an attacker might be establishing persistence, executing arbitrary code, or exfiltrating data. While some events could be benign, the combination raises enough concern to warrant further investigation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about all of them—maybe the chrome.exe registry writes are normal—but given the other suspicious activities, it's safer to consider this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe executing a script that creates and deletes a file, which may indicate malicious activity. Additionally, there are numerous remote command executions that could be signs of unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
