{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nLooking at the events, I see multiple entries from `chrome.exe` with network connection and DNS queries. These are common activities for a web browser, so nothing unusual there.\n\nThen, there are several entries from `powershell.exe`. The first thing that stands out is the command line in some of these: `& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}`. This script seems to be listing directories and files recursively, which could indicate an attempt to gather information about the system's file structure.\n\nAdditionally, there are process access events and registry modifications. PowerShell often interacts with the registry, but repeated access or changes might warrant closer look. The creation and deletion of a temporary PS1 script file in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` is another point to consider. This could be part of a script execution attempt, possibly malicious.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events from PowerShell. These can sometimes indicate the use of certain cmdlets or modules that might have security implications.\n\nConsidering all these together, while individual actions like network connections or file deletions aren't necessarily suspicious on their own, the combination—especially the repeated PowerShell activities with potentially malicious scripting—increases the concern. This batch might be indicative of a potential attack or lateral movement within the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts and file operations, including creation and deletion of temporary files, along with process and registry activity, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The tasks include Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. Specifically, one entry has a command line with 'powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}'. This looks like it's running some script recursively through directories, which could be part of data collection or worse.\n\nThen there are several svchost.exe processes modifying the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate process but often used by malware because many services run under it. Multiple registry writes in quick succession might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not standard operations.\n\nThere's also an instance where conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are making registry changes. Conhost is typically related to console windows, so unexpected registry activity could be a red flag.\n\nI notice that some events have 'User Account Management' tasks with no process name. This might indicate privilege escalation or account manipulation attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there's repeated file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is an ELK tool for log management. However, in this context, it's creating files in a user's Downloads folder, which could be normal but needs to be checked against known baselines.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell activities, registry modifications across different processes, and repeated User Account Management events without clear process names suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because these activities are common indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell command execution, registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes, and user account management events which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I've got a batch of four events to analyze. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows process name as calc.exe with an ImageLoad task and file path C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is typically innocent, but sometimes attackers might use it for lateral movement or to execute malicious code. The fact that it's loading urlmon.dll could be suspicious because URLMON.DLL is related to handling URLs, which can be used in various ways, including potential exploitation.\n\nThe second event is svchost.exe with a Registry value set task. SvcHost is a common system process, often associated with services. However, seeing registry changes might indicate some activity, but it's not immediately alarming since many legitimate processes modify the registry. But multiple events from svchost could be concerning if they're doing similar things.\n\nThe third event mirrors the second: another instance of svchost.exe setting a registry value. So now we have two such events. That repetition might raise an eyebrow because attackers often use multiple instances or repeated actions to cover their tracks or perform malicious tasks without being immediately noticed.\n\nThe fourth event is Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. This is interesting because Calculator.exe, like calc.exe, is another common tool that's usually benign but can be used maliciously if modified or used in conjunction with other activities. The same file path as the first event suggests a possible pattern here.\n\nPutting it all together: we have two different legitimate processes (calc.exe and Calculator.exe) both loading urlmon.dll. Additionally, svchost.exe is making registry changes twice. Since svchost is often used by malware to hide their processes under common names, this could indicate malicious activity. The repetition in the events might be part of a larger sequence that's trying to establish persistence or spread within the system.\n\nI should also consider if these activities are normal. For instance, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll might not be unusual on their own, but combined with svchost.exe making registry changes, especially twice in quick succession, could suggest something is amiss. It's possible that an attacker is using these processes to execute malicious code or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe confidence level: since there are multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities and repetitions, I'd say the confidence is around 0.8. There's a strong possibility that this batch indicates malicious behavior, but without more context on the exact nature of the registry changes or how urlmon.dll is being used, it's not a certainty.\n\nSo, overall, this batch is interesting because it combines multiple events that could be part of a coordinated attack, especially given the repetition and the use of processes known for their dual-use potential.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe) performing potentially suspicious activities, such as loading urlmon.dll and making registry changes. The repetition and combination suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
