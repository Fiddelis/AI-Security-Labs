{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe showing network connections detected. That's a bit normal because Chrome handles a lot of network traffic, especially when browsing the web. But seeing multiple instances in a row might be worth looking into—maybe checking if they're part of legitimate activity or if there's an unusual number of connections.\n\nNext, I see some events from powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The file created is named 'componente_auxiliar.txt' which doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but it's in the Downloads folder, so maybe that's suspicious depending on how the system was being used.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe again. Registry modifications can be part of normal operation for software updates or configurations, but if they're happening frequently or in unexpected areas, that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere's an entry from SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. That sounds a bit concerning because urlmon is associated with URL handling and could potentially be involved in downloading files or executing code if misused by malware.\n\nAnother entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems less concerning since it's likely part of the log shipping process, but again, context matters. If this process is running unexpectedly or with elevated privileges, that might warrant attention.\n\nFinally, more powershell.exe events showing process accesses could be an indicator of post-exploitation activity where attackers are trying to access other processes or services on the system.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of normal and potentially concerning activities. The repeated network connections from Chrome, file creation by PowerShell in user space, multiple registry writes, loading of urlmon.dll, and process accesses could be red flags. However, without additional context like timestamps or known behavior patterns, it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several activities that individually seem normal but together might indicate something more concerning. The confidence isn't too high, maybe around 0.6, since some of these could be legitimate actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including network connections from Chrome.exe, file creation and registry modifications by PowerShell.exe, and loading of urlmon.dll by SDXHelper.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal browsing activity, nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is executed. It's often used to get system info, but without more context, I can't say for sure if it's malicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell can be both good and bad; it's a powerful tool that's commonly used by attackers but also admins. So this alone isn't suspicious, but multiple instances might raise a flag.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file seems related to log shipping or monitoring tools. If the system is using ELK stack, this makes sense and probably isn't malicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access—again, not inherently bad, but worth keeping an eye on if it's part of a pattern.\n\nThe cmd.exe command line stands out: it's running certutil with some parameters to encode and decode files. Certutil is often used in attacks because it can bypass certain restrictions. The command is trying to create calc.exe from encoded files in the temp directory, which is a red flag. This could be part of creating malicious executables.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes without any file info. Again, if this is happening alongside other suspicious activities, it's concerning.\n\nAnother cmd.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so that adds to the suspicion.\n\nCertutil.exe is used again here with encode and decode commands. This aligns with known techniques where attackers use certutil to create malicious files due to its ability to bypass certain file extensions restrictions. The path in the temp directory suggests they're trying to write executable files there.\n\nMultiple instances of certutil.exe setting registry values—this repetition makes me think it's part of a larger process, possibly installing malware or creating persistence.\n\nThe last few events involve rundll32 and some image loads from system32. These could be normal operations, but the combination with previous suspicious activities might indicate something more.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several signs that point towards potential malicious activity. The use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files is a common technique in attacks, especially to create executables like calc.exe which is often used as a test payload. Multiple instances of powershell and cmd accessing processes and modifying the registry without clear justification could indicate an attack. While there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, the combination of these events creates enough concern that this batch should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including the use of certutil.exe for encoding\/decoding files, cmd.exe commands attempting to create executables in temp directories, and repeated registry modifications. These patterns are indicative of potential malicious behavior such as payload generation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
