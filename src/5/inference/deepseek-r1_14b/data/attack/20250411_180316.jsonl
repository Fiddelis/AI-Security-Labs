{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at each event individually:\n\n1. **RuntimeBroker.exe** setting registry values. That's normal for Windows processes.\n2. **Notepad.exe** doing the same registry thing. Not unusual; many apps interact with the registry.\n3. **Powershell.exe** accessed. Powershell is a dual-use tool, so any activity here needs closer look, but access alone isn't bad.\n4. **Calc.exe** loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows component.\n5. **Svchost.exe** again setting registry values. Svchost is part of system services and often logs such events.\n6. More instances of svchost.exe doing the same—nothing suspicious yet.\n7. **Calculator.exe** also loading urlmon.dll. Again, standard behavior for some apps.\n8. Another svchost event. Still normal.\n9. **Winlogbeat.exe** creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely part of logging setup; no issues here.\n10. Powershell accessed again. Just access, not execution of commands.\n11. **Whoami.exe** run with command line showing its path. Basic system info tool, nothing wrong.\n12. ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry—standard Windows behavior.\n13. Calculator.exe again with registry set. Same as before.\n14. Powershell accessed once more; still just access.\n15. **Chrome.exe** creating a pipe and setting registry. Chrome is known to do this for extensions or plugins.\n16. WMIC.exe process creation with command to delete notepad.exe. Hmm, WMIC can be used maliciously, but the command here seems legitimate—deleting processes is normal admin activity.\n17. cmd.exe running a wmic command to delete notepad.exe. Again, system admin tasks.\n18. WMIC.exe loading urlmon and amsi.dll. Urlmon is standard; amsi is for antivirus, so that's fine.\n19. More events with chrome.exe and others doing normal registry operations.\n\nNow, considering the combination: The batch shows multiple legitimate processes interacting normally. Powershell is accessed several times but there's no indication of malicious commands being run. The WMIC command to delete notepad.exe looks like it could be from an admin script or a legitimate process. There are no signs of unusual file creations outside expected system files, and all image loads are for standard DLLs.\n\nI don't see any red flags like repeated failed logins, writes to unexpected files, or known malicious process names. All activities are within normal Windows operation parameters.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events from legitimate processes performing standard operations such as registry modifications and loading system DLLs. There's no indication of malicious activity or unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving 'chrome.exe' with tasks related to setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome might be adjusting some settings. There are five such events in the batch, so nothing too suspicious there.\n\nThen there's a 'powershell.exe' event where it accessed something but didn't involve any files. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I'll have to keep an eye on that.\n\nNext up, someone ran 'whoami.exe' via command line without any file involvement. Whoami just shows user info, which isn't too concerning unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n\nAnother PowerShell access event follows. It's showing up multiple times here; maybe the system runs scripts regularly with PowerShell, so this alone might not be a red flag yet.\n\nLooking further down, there's a 'cmd.exe' command line that copies an exe file and renames it. The command is: copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's interesting because replacing system files can be risky. I should check what sethc.exe does normally. If it's a legitimate process, maybe not, but if it's part of an exploit, that could be bad.\n\nAnother event deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. The command is schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f. Deleting tasks can hide persistence mechanisms or remove traces, so that's something to note.\n\nThere are multiple registry modifications by various processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of malicious activities for persistence or privilege escalation, but again, it depends on what exactly is being changed.\n\nI also see 'schtasks.exe' loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, so maybe not an issue unless there's something wrong with how the task is scheduled.\n\nPutting this all together, while most events are normal system processes like Chrome and PowerShell usage, there are a few red flags. The command replacing sethc.exe and deleting a scheduled task could indicate tampering or attempts to hide malicious activities. The repeated registry modifications across different processes might be part of an attack chain setting up persistence.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions together are definitively malicious, but they do raise some eyebrows. There's enough potentially suspicious behavior that it's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations and registry modifications by various executables, including cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing actions such as copying files and deleting scheduled tasks, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see if there's anything that stands out.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see processes like cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe. These are all common system and application processes on Windows machines. The tasks associated with them include things like Registry value sets, Image loads, Process Create, and File created events.\n\nI notice that cmd.exe is being used multiple times, which isn't unusual since it's a standard command-line tool. Chrome.exe loading some DLLs also seems normal—browsers often load various system files when running. Conhost.exe is another common process related to console windows, so its activity doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes are just running to get user information, which is a typical legitimate operation. The command lines for these processes don't seem suspicious either; they're straightforward executions without any unusual arguments.\n\nNow, the powershell.exe entries catch my attention because PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. I need to look closer at what each instance is doing. Most of them are creating processes or accessing registry values. For example:\n- One entry shows powershell.exe being started with a command line \"& {}\", which is just an empty script—maybe part of some automated task.\n- Another one creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1, which is unusual because it's creating a new PowerShell script in an unpredictable location. This might be to test script execution policies or could indicate malicious activity trying to execute scripts.\n\nI also see several instances where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which again isn't inherently suspicious but could be part of legitimate scripting operations. However, the creation of a new PS1 file in the Temp directory without any clear justification might be concerning. It suggests that something is generating or dropping scripts there, possibly to execute them later.\n\nPutting it all together, while most events are normal system and application activities, the powershell.exe instances creating a script file in an unexpected location might indicate potential malicious behavior. This could be part of a broader attack where scripts are being tested or deployed. Therefore, this batch should be considered interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell instances creating unexpected files and accessing registry values, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that include \"& {}\". This looks like they're executing a script or some commands via PowerShell. The tasks associated are \"Provider Lifecycle\", which suggests the PowerShell engine is starting up or initializing. There are several instances of this, so it might be part of legitimate script execution.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file was deleted using PowerShell. That's concerning because deleting files can indicate malicious activity, especially if done by a script. However, I need to check if the path looks suspicious. The path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1\". Temporary scripts often have such names and locations, so it might be part of a legitimate process, like testing script policies.\n\nThen, there's an event where a file was created in the \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\" directory. This seems normal as PowerShell profiles or cached data are stored here.\n\nLooking at other events, there are several instances of registry value sets and process accesses by PowerShell. These could be part of script execution or legitimate configuration changes. The use of 'whoami.exe' is a common command used to get user information, which isn't inherently malicious but can be part of recon scripts.\n\nI also notice that many of these events involve the same processes and files repeatedly. It might indicate a script running multiple times or checking certain conditions, like the existence of specific batch files in various directories. The command lines have complex paths with varying folder structures, which could be an attempt to check multiple locations for some file.\n\nWhile there are signs that PowerShell is being used extensively, which can be concerning because it's often exploited by attackers, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious behavior beyond the deletion event. No known malicious scripts or modules are referenced, and the repeated checks might be part of a legitimate process, perhaps a script verifying its environment before executing.\n\nTherefore, while there is some cause for caution due to the use of PowerShell and file deletions, without more specific signs like encrypted files, unusual network traffic, or known malicious scripts, this batch doesn't strongly indicate an ongoing attack. It might still be worth monitoring but isn't immediately classified as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate PowerShell activity and system processes without clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's look at the events provided.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in administrative tools and can execute scripts. The command lines show some conditional checks using Test-Path, which might be testing if certain files exist. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\\\\\"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This could indicate an attempt to check for the presence of specific files, possibly as part of a persistence mechanism or to ensure certain scripts are available.\n\nThere's also file creation and deletion events. Powershell created a temporary script \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1\" and then immediately deleted it. This might be an attempt to bypass script execution policies by creating and deleting the file quickly, leaving no trace. Additionally, a file named \"elemento_padrao.txt\" was created in the Downloads folder. It's unclear if this is malicious, but combined with other actions, it raises suspicion.\n\nAnother point is the multiple Registry value sets from chrome.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, especially for extensions or settings, repeated writes could be a sign of something unusual. If these are not related to known Chrome activities, they might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events, powershell.exe loaded several .NET and MS Core libraries. This is common in PowerShell scripts but can also be part of legitimate use. However, when combined with other suspicious activity, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe Pipe Created event from powershell.exe could indicate communication with another process or for lateral movement within a network. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, and their creation by malicious processes is a common tactic.\n\nThere's also Engine Lifecycle events from Powershell, which might be related to script execution or module loading. These alone aren't suspicious, but in combination with the other activities, they contribute to an overall pattern of potentially malicious behavior.\n\nI'm concerned about the repeated attempts to check for specific files and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts. These actions are often seen in attacks to ensure persistence or to clean up traces after execution. The involvement of Powershell along with these file operations is a red flag, especially when combined with registry modifications which can be used for persistence.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming, the cluster of activities involving Powershell, file manipulation, registry changes, and pipe creation suggests a coordinated effort that could be malicious. Therefore, this batch does merit further investigation to assess the risk and potential impact.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potentially malicious activity, making it interesting for further investigation.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Powershell Activity**: Multiple entries show Powershell executing scripts with conditional checks using `Test-Path`. These scripts attempt to check for the presence of specific files, which could be part of a persistence mechanism or file dropper routine.\n\n2. **File Manipulation**: Powershell creates and immediately deletes temporary scripts, possibly to bypass execution policies. Additionally, a file is created in the Downloads folder, raising suspicion about its origin and purpose.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Chrome.exe makes several registry changes, which while not inherently malicious, could indicate unauthorized activity or tampering if unrelated to known Chrome functions.\n\n4. **ImageLoad Events**: Powershell loads various .NET libraries, common in scripts but potentially suspicious when combined with other activities.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation**: A pipe is created by Powershell, often used for inter-process communication, possibly indicating lateral movement within a network.\n\n6. **Engine Lifecycle Events**: These events from Powershell relate to script execution, adding to the pattern of potential malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of Powershell usage with file operations, registry changes, and pipe creation suggests a coordinated effort that could be part of an attack. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature of these activities and assess the risk to the system."}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events involve powershell.exe being executed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers for malicious activities. So, seeing multiple instances of it running catches my attention.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks, there are several \"Registry value set\" events and some file creations. The Registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that might not be normal. I remember that attackers often use registry keys to maintain their presence on a system, so this is something to note.\n\nOne event stands out because it has a command line with a long string involving New-Item and Set-Content commands. These are PowerShell cmdlets used to create new items in directories and set content to files, respectively. The paths mentioned point to .bat files being created or modified. I'm thinking that creating batch scripts can be a way to execute other commands later, which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these could be legitimate, the combination with powershell.exe running scripts makes me cautious. Attackers sometimes use these frameworks to obfuscate their activities or execute malicious code.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1. Temporary PowerShell script files can be used for testing policies or scripts, but without knowing the context, it could indicate some form of script execution that might not be intended.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple powershell.exe instances, file creations, registry modifications, and script-related activities—it feels like this batch could be indicative of malicious behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell and the specific commands used are red flags in a cybersecurity context. While it's possible some of these actions are legitimate, the combination raises concerns about potential attacks.\n\nI'm leaning towards marking this as interesting because the pattern doesn't look entirely normal, especially with the file and registry changes along with script executions. It would be wise to investigate further to see if any of these scripts or modifications are part of known attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is marked as **interesting** due to multiple instances of powershell.exe execution combined with file creation and registry modification activities, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interested\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple powershell.exe executions, file creations, and registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a File Delete task involving powershell.exe deleting a .ps1 file in the Temp directory. That's interesting because scripts in Temp can be malicious, but it's not definitive yet.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe creates files with names ending in .bat. These batch files are often used for executing commands, which could be suspicious if they're created dynamically or in unusual locations.\n\nI also notice several Registry value sets from powershell.exe and conhost.exe. The Registry is a common target for malware to maintain persistence, so this adds concern.\n\nThe events show a lot of Image loaded tasks by powershell.exe, loading various .dll files. This is normal for PowerShell, but the specific modules being loaded could be suspicious if they're part of known malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are many Process Create and Access events related to these processes, which might indicate some form of process injection or lateral movement within the system.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with these file operations, registry modifications, and potential script execution points towards potentially malicious behavior. The creation of .bat files suggests they might be used to execute commands later on.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The events are all in JSONL format, each being a separate log entry.\n\nFirst, I notice that most entries involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used by attackers because it has built-in encryption and can execute scripts. So that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, several have complex paths with backslashes and are using Test-Path to check for specific files. For example: \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\\" which seems like they're checking if certain .bat files exist. The pattern of checking multiple locations across different directories might indicate a script trying to verify its presence or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also see that there are events where temporary PowerShell scripts are created and then deleted quickly, such as 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1'. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files rapidly can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry writes by powershell.exe, which could be setting up persistence points or modifying system configurations in a way that's not typical for standard operations.\n\nOther events show powershell.exe accessing other processes and loading DLLs related to Windows Defender. This might be an attempt to bypass antivirus or to check if certain security tools are present before executing malicious activities.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of immediate harm, like files being deleted or exfiltration attempts, but the pattern of behavior is concerning. The repeated use of powershell.exe with these specific commands suggests a potential script running multiple checks across the system, possibly for lateral movement or to ensure persistence.\n\nSo overall, while it's not conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the combination of behaviors—using powershell with complex paths, creating\/deleting temp scripts, registry modifications—is significant enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances are checking for specific files across various directories using Test-Path.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that check for the existence of certain files. For example, the command lines like Test-Path on specific paths seem unusual. Why would PowerShell be checking so many different file locations? It could indicate someone is trying to verify if certain binaries exist, which might be part of malicious activities.\n\nThen, I see several ImageLoad events where powershell.exe loads various .NET and other DLLs. While this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the combination with the other events might raise a flag. Malware often uses legitimate processes like PowerShell to hide their activities.\n\nThere are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for temporary script files. Creating and then deleting a file quickly is a common tactic to avoid detection or to clean up evidence after executing malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where whoami.exe and cmd.exe are used with command lines that check the existence of files in the temp directory. Using whoami could be an attempt to gather system information, which is often part of reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nThe Registry value sets in powershell.exe events make me think about potential persistence mechanisms. Attackers might try to set registry keys to ensure their malicious scripts run on each login or startup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions with file checks, temporary file creation\/deletion, use of other tools like whoami and cmd for file existence checks, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst off, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities due to its extensive scripting capabilities and the ability to execute commands without raising too many alarms.\n\nLooking at the events:\n- There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing something with 'ProcessAccess'. This could mean it's trying to access other processes or files, which might be part of a larger attack.\n- Some events show Registry value sets. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to maintain access after reboots.\n- There are several instances where whoami.exe is being executed. While whoami is generally benign and used for user identification, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate an attempt to gather information about the system.\n\nI also see that some PowerShell commands have complex command lines. For example:\n- The command checks if a specific file path exists using Test-Path. If it doesn't exist, it exits with 0; else, 1. This might be part of a script checking for certain files to execute malicious code conditionally.\n- These repeated checks across different paths could indicate a broader lateral movement or file reconnaissance within the system.\n\nThe events where task is 'Provider Lifecycle' are a bit unclear, but they involve PowerShell again. It's possible that these are related to event subscription or handling in .NET, which could be part of more complex scripting activities.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed.\n- Registry modifications, which can be used for persistence.\n- Use of whoami.exe, possibly for system information gathering.\n- Complex command-line arguments suggesting script execution with conditional checks on file existence.\n  \nThese indicators collectively point towards potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at a batch of events from system logs. The user wants me to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation as a cybersecurity expert. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. \n\nStarting with the first few events: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being run. The tasks logged include Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, etc. I notice that some PowerShell scripts are creating files in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. Those temporary files might be a sign of script execution or testing.\n\nLooking deeper, the command lines for powershell.exe are complex and include if statements checking for file paths. The 'Test-Path' cmdlet is used to see if specific .ps1 scripts exist in various directories. This could indicate that the scripts are attempting to locate and execute other PowerShell scripts, which might be malicious.\n\nThere's a mix of events: some are Image loads and File creations\/deletions, others involve Registry access and Process accesses. Also, there's an event where whoami.exe is run, which is often used for privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nI'm concerned because multiple attempts to check for the existence of scripts (like Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different paths might suggest a persistence mechanism or data exfiltration. The use of temporary files and registry modifications could be part of an attack chain.\n\nHowever, some of these events are typical PowerShell activities, especially in environments where scripts are regularly executed. But the repeated checks for specific script locations and the creation\/deletion of temp files make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious or just legitimate, but given the indicators like file deletions, registry changes, and multiple process creations with specific command lines, I think there's a high probability that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions attempt to access or modify system components, including temporary files and registry entries, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}

I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first few entries show `powershell.exe` accessing processes and loading images like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET Framework. That seems normal since PowerShell often loads these libraries when running scripts.\n   \n2. Then there are events where a temporary PowerShell script is created and immediately deleted. This could be suspicious because creating and then deleting files might be an attempt to avoid detection, but I'm not sure yet.\n\n3. There's an event showing the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory by PowerShell. That might indicate some configuration changes or persistence mechanisms, which is something to look into.\n\n4. Another event involves `whoami.exe` being run, which is commonly used to gather user information and could be part of reconnaissance activities.\n\n5. Notepad and Calculator executables are involved in registry events and loading URLMON.DLL respectively. While not inherently malicious, these might be red flags depending on the context. For example, Notepad accessing the registry isn't typical unless it's for some malicious script execution.\n\n6. There's a lot of activity related to `powershell.exe`, including multiple instances being run with different command lines checking for specific script paths (Get-Keystrokes.ps1). This script name sounds like it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is definitely a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several concerning activities:\n- Multiple attempts by PowerShell to check and potentially execute scripts from various locations.\n- Creation and deletion of temporary files, possibly to avoid detection.\n- Use of `whoami.exe` which can provide user information useful for lateral movement or credential harvesting.\n- Registry modifications by both Notepad and svchost.exe, which could be signs of persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile individual events might not raise alarms on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated checks for specific scripts and the associated file operations are concerning. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell, including script creation\/deletion and potential reconnaissance with whoami.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they seem to be from a system log parser, probably something like ELK with winlogbeat. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The fields include process details, Windows logs (winlog), and file information.\n\nThe first event is about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its data directory. That's normal because winlogbeat would be writing its configuration or logs there. Not suspicious at all.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from 'powershell.exe'. Some are just process accesses, which could mean PowerShell is being run but not necessarily doing anything malicious. Then there's a 'Process Create' event for whoami.exe and powershell.exe again. Using whoami to check user info isn't unusual unless it's part of privilege escalation, but alone, it's fine.\n\nLooking further, several events are about network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is standard since it's a browser. Svchost is a known Windows process for services; seeing it make network connections might be concerning if unexpected, but without more context, I'm not sure.\n\nThere are also DNS queries from chrome.exe. That makes sense because browsers need to resolve domain names. No red flags there.\n\nThen, in the middle of the logs, powershell.exe is creating a new process with a command line that includes some PowerShell commands: 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. Using ls and get-childitem recursively could be part of information gathering or file enumeration. This might be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often use such commands to explore the file system.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry accesses and image load events from powershell.exe. Registry modifications can indicate persistence mechanisms or changes to system settings, which is something to watch for. Loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll might be part of normal PowerShell operation, but it's worth checking if these loads are expected.\n\nThe volume of events related to powershell.exe stands out. While some are standard, the combination of file enumeration commands and registry modifications could indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell for malicious purposes. The repeated 'ProcessAccess' events on powershell.exe might suggest process injection or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps showing close proximity or signs of failed attempts, it's hard to be certain. But considering the activities together—file enumeration, registry changes—they tilt towards being potentially malicious. Therefore, this batch is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell events with potential file enumeration and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe creating a file in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because PowerShell scripts are often used for malicious activities. Then, another event shows that same file being deleted. File creation and deletion in quick succession might be an attempt to hide something.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe runs some commands with \"&\" which is a command separator. The specific commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem could indicate directory traversal or gathering system info—common tactics for reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, I see several instances of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in PowerShell. These aren't typical day-to-day activities; they might be part of setting up modules or loading malicious code.\n\nThen there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is the ELK agent for log shipping. That seems normal unless it's modifying logs to cover tracks. Also, conhost.exe accessing registry values caught my eye because conhost is often used in command-line attacks and could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nPowerShell accessing the registry without a specific reason raises flags too. Registry modifications are common for persistence or privilege escalation. Lastly, there's another file creation by powershell.exe in Downloads, which might be dropping malicious files.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious commands, file creations\/deletions, registry accesses, and the use of conhost.exe—all point towards potential malicious activity. The repeated provider and engine lifecycle tasks suggest a script is being executed or loaded, possibly for lateral movement or to establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious activities such as file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and command-line operations indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
