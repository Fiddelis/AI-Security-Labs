{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the first event is schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks, and it would typically load that DLL. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, svchost.exe has a registry object change. Svchost is a common system process, so registry activity isn't unusual. I'll keep an eye on the other events to see if this happens too much or in combination with something else.\n\nThen, cmd.exe is involved in setting a registry value..Cmd is a standard command-line tool, and it's often used for legitimate tasks. But sometimes attackers use it for malicious purposes. The command line here just says \"\/c\", which usually means running a single command. Not enough info yet.\n\nConhost.exe also sets a registry value. Conhost is related to console windows; again, not inherently suspicious unless there are multiple such events or other anomalies.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing a process. Powershell is powerful and often used by both admins and attackers. The task is 'ProcessAccess', which could be legitimate, but I'll note this since powershell can execute scripts.\n\nAnother whoami.exe run without any command line arguments. Whoami just gives user info; unless it's being used in a larger context or with other malicious activities, it's not concerning on its own.\n\nThere are multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe accessing processes or registry values. This repetition could be normal admin activity or part of a script, but I'm flagging it because powershell is commonly misused.\n\nLooking further, there are several chrome.exe events loading DLLs and setting registry values. Chrome is a legitimate application, so unless these activities are outside the norm for its operation, they might not indicate malicious behavior.\n\nI also see multiple 'Process Create' tasks for cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. These could be part of normal operations or script executions, but again, powershell's involvement makes me cautious.\n\nIn total, I notice a pattern where several processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) are accessing the registry and creating new processes. While each individual event might not be suspicious, the combination—especially the repeated use of powershell with process access tasks—might indicate potential malicious activity like script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps, user accounts involved, or unusual file paths, it's hard to be certain. The fact that some events are repeated and involve known tools used in attacks could still make this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, along with repetitive use of cmd.exe and other system processes, may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've been given a batch of JSONL events and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The output should be just one classification with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's WMIC.exe loading a file from Windows Defender's directory. That might be suspicious because WMIC is often used by attackers. But wait, sometimes legitimate processes do load defender-related files, so maybe not always bad.\n\nNext, there are several events where programs like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities to maintain persistence or change system configurations. But again, some legitimate software also modifies the registry during operation.\n\nI notice that cmd.exe is used in a couple of events with specific command lines. For example, one event copies an exe file and renames it. The command line is \"\/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like an attempt to replace sethc.exe, which could be a way to hide malicious code since legitimate programs might not check the new version.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event runs \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", deleting a scheduled task. If this is happening multiple times or without user interaction, it could indicate an attacker trying to remove evidence or disrupt monitoring.\n\nThere are also events where schtasks.exe itself is used with the same command line as before, deleting the same task. This repetition might be concerning because it suggests persistent attempts to remove tasks from the system.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe, there are multiple instances of it being accessed and modifying registry values. PowerShell is powerful and often misused in attacks for executing scripts or commands. The repeated access could be an attempt to execute malicious scripts, especially if combined with other actions like registry modifications.\n\nThe whoami.exe events don't seem too suspicious on their own, but when combined with the other activities, they might indicate reconnaissance or credential gathering.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances of legitimate tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) being used for tasks that could be part of malicious activities. The repeated attempts to delete scheduled tasks and replace system files suggest potential tampering with system integrity. Additionally, the combination of registry modifications across different processes might indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or hide malicious activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of events shows signs of possible unauthorized system changes and could be indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe performing suspicious actions, such as deleting scheduled tasks and replacing system files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of events here, each with process info, winlog tasks, and sometimes file paths. The processes involved include RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and others.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several types like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, Process Create, Pipe Created. Some of these seem normal for regular system operations, but others might indicate something malicious.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is appearing multiple times with tasks like 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set'. Powershell can be legitimate but is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's accessing registry values could be part of an attack.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe process running \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Wmic is another tool often associated with attacks because it allows remote commands. Combining this with deleting processes (like notepad.exe) might indicate someone trying to remove traces or kill certain processes, which could be malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the use of whoami.exe and WMIC.exe in Process Create events stands out. These tools are typically used for gathering information about the system but can also be part of an attack chain, especially if used with elevated privileges or to execute commands.\n\nThe file paths mentioned sometimes point to System32 DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Malware might inject into legitimate processes (like Calculator.exe) using these DLLs as part of their activities, trying to bypass detection mechanisms or load malicious components.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. SvcHost is commonly used by services in Windows but can also be exploited by malware to hide their processes under legitimate service host names, making it harder to detect.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe file being created. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper for Windows logs, so if this process is running legitimately on the system, it might not be suspicious. But if it's unexpected or part of an attack, it could be a red flag.\n\nTaking all these events together: multiple calls to powershell and cmd with wmic, deletion commands, use of whoami and WMIC, and file loads into System32 DLLs—this combination suggests potential malicious activities such as process termination (possibly to remove evidence), persistence mechanisms, or privilege escalation. The repeated attempts with different tools and command-line arguments make me lean towards this being an attack rather than normal system operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this batch of logs is definitely interesting for investigation because there are several red flags indicating possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process accesses and registry modifications, cmd.exe with wmic commands to delete processes, and WMIC.exe execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this JSONL data to analyze. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst line: The process is whoami.exe being created. That seems normal because it's a system utility used to identify the current user.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe. I know PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious. Let me check the tasks associated with these processes. \n\nLooking at the second entry, powershell.exe accessed something (ProcessAccess). Not sure if that's suspicious yet. Then it set a registry value—registry modifications can be indicators of malicious activity, especially when done by scripts.\n\nThe third event is another process create for powershell.exe. That's standard but needs context. The command line looks empty or possibly malformed (\"powershell.exe & {}\"), which might indicate some automation or script execution.\n\nFourth and fifth events are more ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe. Not immediately alarming, but repeated access could be part of a script's process.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs loaded by PowerShell. These are normal when running scripts that require .NET components, so maybe it's just a script execution. But I should consider if these specific DLLs are commonly used in malicious scripts or not.\n\nLooking further down, there's a FileCreate event for a PS1 file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. That filename looks suspicious—often scripts with random names and underscores might be generated by malware to avoid detection. Also, creating a temp script file is a common step before executing it.\n\nThen immediately after, there's a FileDeleteDetected event for the same file. This could mean that the process tried to delete it quickly after creation, which is a red flag because attackers often clean up evidence.\n\nNext few events are Provider Lifecycle tasks again for powershell.exe with command lines containing \"& {}\". Not sure what that signifies exactly, but repeated such events might indicate an automated or script-based process.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for winlogbeat.exe, creating a config file. Winlogbeat is likely part of their monitoring setup, so this seems benign unless it's unexpected in the environment.\n\nFinally, Pipe Created and Engine Lifecycle events for PowerShell—these are normal when scripts use pipes to communicate or create named pipes for interprocess communication, which can be both legitimate and malicious depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, including creating a temp script file that gets deleted quickly. The repeated process creations with \"& {}\" in the command line might indicate some form of persistence or script execution trying to hide itself. The use of multiple registry accesses and image loads could be part of setting up an environment for malicious activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the combination of creating, deleting a temp script quickly, along with other PowerShell activity, suggests potential malicious behavior. However, it's not conclusive since some actions could be legitimate scripts or normal admin tasks. My confidence is moderate—around 0.7—because while there are signs that warrant attention, they might also be explainable non-malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including creating and deleting a temporary script file, repeated process creations with unusual command lines, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities like executing scripts or downloading payloads.\n\nLooking closer, I see that in some events, PowerShell is creating new files. For example, 'New-Item' creates \"modulo_secundario_script.bat\" and sets content using 'Set-Content'. This seems suspicious because it's generating batch files which can be executed later, potentially malicious commands.\n\nAnother point is the command lines used. They're constructing file paths that go up multiple directories with \"..\", which might indicate attempts to write to unintended locations or access restricted areas. For instance, \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\\" could be trying to reach a parent directory, possibly outside the intended folder.\n\nThere are also registry changes and image loading events from various .NET framework files. While some of these might be normal for PowerShell execution, the combination with file creation suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nThe fact that multiple similar events occur with different paths and filenames raises my concern. It appears systematic, like a script running in a loop or across different directories, which is common in attacks to spread malware or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm noticing that all these events are from the same process, so it's likely one script generating multiple logs. This could be part of an attempt to drop files across the system or create scheduled tasks for later execution.\n\nThe justification here is that the activities show signs of file manipulation and path traversal using PowerShell, which are common tactics in cyberattacks. The confidence is high because the pattern of behavior aligns with known malicious techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating new batch files and writing content to them, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various DLL files. These are things like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Loading these modules could be part of normal PowerShell operations, especially if they're related to .NET framework or system processes. But sometimes, attackers use PowerShell for malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event in the Temporary folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Then immediately after that, it deletes the same file. This pattern—create and then delete—is suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious code before deleting them to cover their tracks.\n\nAnother point is the command lines in PowerShell. The commands are checking if certain batch files exist by using Test-Path. If they don't exist, the script exits with 0. It's a bit odd that they're checking for file existence this way, especially since it's done through PowerShell and involves multiple checks on different paths.\n\nThere are also several registry value set events from chrome.exe. That might seem normal at first glance because Chrome does interact with the registry for settings. However, if these changes are happening outside of typical user interactions or in large numbers, they could be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe repeat multiple times. This repetition could indicate something unusual, but since it's from a legitimate process (Chrome), unless there's evidence that Chrome itself was compromised, I'm not sure if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activities stand out more because they involve creating and deleting temporary files, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection. The repeated ImageLoad events might be part of normal operations, but combined with the file creation\/deletion and specific command-line checks, it raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n\nSo overall, the batch seems interesting because there are several red flags related to PowerShell behavior that could indicate an attack. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context, so my confidence is high but not absolute.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious PowerShell activities including the creation and deletion of a temporary file and multiple ImageLoad events, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell process creating some files and setting content using New-Item and Set-Content commands. This could be normal script execution but might also indicate malicious activity, like creating persistence scripts.\n\nThen there are multiple events where PowerShell is creating temporary files in different paths. The file creation tasks (rule: FileCreate) are happening, which could be part of legitimate scripting or could be writing malicious scripts to disk.\n\nI notice that some files being created have names ending with \"_script.bat\". This naming suggests they might be script-related files. Legitimate scripts use similar names, but it's a red flag because attackers often use such names to hide their activities.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is accessing the registry (rule: RegistryEvent). Registry modifications can be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations, which could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a temporary file in one event. Deleting files after execution is common for attackers to cover their tracks. The fact that it's a PowerShell script being deleted might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple image load events (rule: ImageLoad) involving various DLLs. While this is normal during script execution, the combination with other suspicious activities raises concern.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple file creations, especially .bat scripts, registry modifications, process access attempts, and temporary file deletions—it's plausible that these events are part of malicious activity. The repetitive patterns in command lines and consistent use of PowerShell suggest a potential attack or unauthorized script execution.\n\nSo, the combination of creating files with possible persistence mechanisms, modifying the registry, and deleting evidence points towards something not just routine but potentially harmful.

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that many of these events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and commands. But on its own, just seeing powershell isn't always suspicious—it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks.\n\nLooking at the specific actions, there are several entries where powershell is creating files, accessing processes, and modifying registry values. For example:\n- One event shows a file being created in \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local...\", which could be part of user-specific configurations.\n- There's also an event where a registry value is set, which might indicate configuration changes but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nI notice several events with command lines that check for the existence of .bat files. The paths like \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\" seem constructed in a way that an attacker might use to evade detection or to ensure certain scripts are present before proceeding. The use of Test-Path suggests they're checking if specific files exist, and exiting with 0 or 1 based on that.\n\nAlso, some processes are created for conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process used by PowerShell to host console windows. Whoami is usually harmless but could be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system's user context.\n\nThe repetition of similar command lines in different events makes me think this might be part of a script that's looping or running multiple times, possibly trying different paths or attempting multiple evasive tactics.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n1. The repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments that check for file existence.\n2. The target files and paths seem arbitrary and not standard system locations, which might be a way to avoid detection.\n3. The combination of registry modifications and process creations could be part of setting up persistence or changing system configurations in a malicious way.\n\nWhile each individual event might not raise red flags on their own, the pattern collectively suggests possible malicious activity. However, without more context (like timestamps showing rapid succession or other indicators), it's hard to be certain. Still, the clustering around powershell and specific file checks leans towards being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command-line arguments checking for files in non-standard paths, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Also, the repeated use of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement techniques.\n\nAdditionally, I see cmd.exe and whoami.exe being executed.

These commands exit with 0 or 1 based on whether the file exists. This kind of activity could be part of a script checking its dependencies, but it's a bit repetitive and could indicate automated checks.\n\nNext, I notice events where PowerShell creates temporary files in the user's AppData folder. Specifically, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1 that's created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is suspicious because creating and immediately deleting files might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace of malicious activity.\n\nThere are also entries related to loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. These aren't unusual on their own but could be part of a process that's attempting to load legitimate modules as a way to hide malicious actions under the guise of antivirus operations.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry value sets and file creations in the StartupProfileData folder, which might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms for a script or application. This is concerning because such actions can allow persistent malware to run at system startup without user knowledge.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, the repeated PowerShell executions with specific checks, coupled with the creation and deletion of temporary files, suggest potential malicious activity. The use of temporary files could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or test for certain conditions without leaving a permanent trace on the system.\n\nThe fact that multiple events involve checking various .bat files across different directories also raises eyebrows.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing an event. Each event has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. \n\nThe first event is a process named powershell.exe accessing something, which triggers a ProcessAccess task. That's normal because PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be malicious.\n\nNext, whoami.exe runs without any file access, just creating a process. This seems benign; whoami is usually used to check user information and doesn't indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes or registry values. The fact that PowerShell is being accessed multiple times might be concerning if it's not part of normal operations. Additionally, one event shows a command line with an if statement checking the existence of specific files. This could be testing whether certain directories exist, which might be part of malicious activity like file reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the 'file' field, most entries don't have any file access info except for some ImageLoad tasks related to DLLs. These are normal operations as PowerShell loads various libraries when running scripts.\n\nThere's a pattern where the same command line is repeated with different paths being checked in each event. This repetition suggests automated checking across multiple directories, which could be part of an attack trying to find specific files or establishing persistence if certain conditions are met.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell with conditional checks on various file paths stands out. While individual events might not look suspicious, the combination indicates potential malicious behavior, such as a script testing for the presence of other components (maybe dropped by an earlier part of an attack) or attempting to execute code conditionally.\n\nI'm also noticing that all these events are from PowerShell processes with specific command lines, which might be part of a larger script trying multiple paths. This could be indicative of lateral movement within a network or testing for file existence across different directories, which is often seen in more sophisticated attacks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows several characteristics that could be red flags: repeated PowerShell executions with conditional checks on various files and paths, which might be part of a malicious script attempting to establish persistence or spread within a network.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is a process creation of 'whoami.exe'. That's a common tool used to check user information, so it could be either benign or malicious depending on the context. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful scripting tool often used by attackers, but it's also commonly used for legitimate admin tasks. The command lines in these events all seem to check if certain files exist using Test-Path and then exiting with 0 or 1. This pattern repeats several times across different paths.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these powershell.exe processes, some are 'Process Create', others are 'Registry value set' and various image loads of DLLs which are normal for PowerShell execution. The repeated file checks in the command lines might be part of a script trying to verify the presence of specific files or directories. This could be an attempt to check if certain malicious files exist before proceeding, which is a common tactic in malware to ensure persistence or to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice that some events are 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks, which typically relate to resource management and aren't usually indicative of malicious activity on their own. However, combined with the repeated file checks, it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe fact that so many powershell.exe processes are being created or accessed could raise a flag. Legitimate scripts might run PowerShell once, but multiple instances checking for files in different locations might suggest some sort of persistence mechanism or lateral movement within the network.\n\nAnother point is the command lines themselves. They all follow a similar structure with if statements and exit codes based on file existence. This uniformity suggests they're part of a larger script that's being executed repeatedly, possibly across different directories. If these files don't exist or are supposed to be present but aren't, it could indicate that an attacker is trying to check for certain conditions before deploying more malicious activities.\n\nConsidering the command line in one event includes checking if 'unidade_comum.exe' exists and exiting accordingly, that's a bit concerning because I haven't heard of this file being legitimate. If it's supposed to be there but isn't, it might trigger an alert.\n\nThe repeated calls to powershell.exe with these specific checks could indicate an attempt at persistence or deploying additional malicious payloads once certain conditions are met. Additionally, the fact that some events are about registry changes and image loads further supports the idea of potentially malicious activity, as attackers often use such techniques to maintain access or hide their presence.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination—multiple powershell.exe instances performing file existence checks across various paths along with process creation and registry modifications—points towards potential malicious behavior.

PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep an eye on. The first two events show that powershell.exe loaded some DLLs (MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll). These files are related to Windows Defender, so that might seem normal. But I should check if the paths look correct.\n\nNext, there are file creation events where PowerShell creates temporary .ps1 files in the user's AppData directory. The names of these files include \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\". This looks a bit suspicious because scripts with random names often indicate malicious activity trying to avoid detection. Also, these files are created and then deleted shortly after, which is another red flag for potential malware behavior.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where whoami.exe was executed. That's usually used to check user privileges and might be part of a reconnaissance phase by attackers to gather information about the system. The fact that it's being run without any obvious reason could indicate something fishy.\n\nAdditionally, multiple events show powershell.exe checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files using Test-Path. This kind of activity is often used in persistence mechanisms or to ensure certain scripts are present before executing them. If these scripts aren't supposed to be there, it might mean an attacker is trying to establish a foothold.\n\nI also notice several \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell. These can be normal during script execution, but combined with the other signs, they add to the suspicion.\n\nOverall, while some of these actions could be legitimate (like Windows Defender updates or system scripts), the combination—especially the temporary file creation\/deletion, whoami.exe usage, and repeated checks for specific scripts—points towards potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation, deletion, and checking script existence, along with the use of whoami.exe, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving PowerShell.exe. It starts with FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks. Sometimes it accesses other processes. Then there are instances where whoami.exe is used, which can be a red flag because it's often part of privilege escalation tactics. \n\nNotepad.exe writing to the registry seems suspicious too, as that's an unusual activity for such an app. There's also Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which might indicate malicious behavior since legitimate apps shouldn't need to load DLLs from system32 in this way.\n\nLooking at winlogbeat.exe creating a file, I'm cautious because it's an external tool; unexpected writes could be part of data exfiltration or log tampering. The repeated NetworkConnect events by Chrome and svchost.exe are also concerning—maybe the browser is connecting to malicious domains or acting as a downloader.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities show signs of possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior. The combination of multiple unusual processes accessing files, registry edits, and network connections suggests potential threats. So, I think this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including PowerShell.exe process accesses, whoami.exe execution, Notepad.exe modifying the registry, Calculator.exe loading system32 DLLs, and repeated network connections from Chrome and svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events are related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts. The first event shows a process command line with a path checking script: Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" suggests it's meant to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic for malware to steal information.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, there are several types like Process Create and Image Load. The fact that powershell.exe is being created (Process Create) and loading various image files might be normal, but combined with the file operations, it's worth paying attention to. There's also a File Created event followed immediately by a File Delete logged for a temporary .ps1 file. This pattern—creating and then deleting a script—is often used by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of Test-Path in the command lines. It seems like the scripts are checking if certain files exist, possibly trying to determine if they're running on a system where specific malware components are present or absent. This kind of behavior can be indicative of reconnaissance or an attempt to avoid being detected.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Image Load events for different DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these might seem normal, the sheer number could indicate that the script is loading several modules, which might not be typical for standard PowerShell usage.\n\nThere's also a file create event from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management. But since it's creating a config file, this doesn't raise red flags on its own but should be noted as context.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell processes checking for specific script files, creating and deleting temporary scripts, loading various modules—these are all behaviors that could be part of malicious activity. The repeated attempts to check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might suggest an attempt to ensure it's present or perhaps a failed execution where the script wasn't found.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of events suggests potential malicious behavior, especially the use of PowerShell with scripts that could be designed for surveillance. The confidence isn't 100% but is high enough to warrant investigation due to the suspicious file operations and repeated checks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe processes checking for malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), creating, then deleting temporary files, which may indicate attempts to execute or avoid detection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: Chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal; browsers do that all the time.\n\nNext is PowerShell accessing something, but without more context, it's hard to say. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is a common tool for user identification. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nI notice multiple entries where PowerShell accesses things and sets registry values. That could be part of legitimate scripting or could be malicious activity. The use of 'ls' and 'get-childitem' suggests file enumeration, which might be exploring the system.\n\nThere are several Image Load events for different DLLs when running PowerShell. This is typical because scripts often load various components. However, the specific paths mentioned don't immediately raise red flags, but it's something to note.\n\nA file was created and then deleted in the Temp folder by PowerShell. That's interesting because creating a script file only to delete it might be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence. Malware sometimes does this to clean up traces of its activity.\n\nThe Pipe Created event is another point of interest. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which could be part of legitimate scripting but could also be a way for malicious code to hide its activities.\n\nMultiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from the same command line look repetitive and might indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or run multiple scripts. This repetition could signal automated or malicious behavior trying different approaches to stay undetected.\n\nPutting it all together, while some actions are normal, the combination of repeated PowerShell usage with suspicious commands, file creation\/deletion, and pipe creation raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The high number of events related to a single process also suggests something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources, creating temporary files, and deleting them suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that several entries involve powershell.exe. I know PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so that's a red flag. Looking at the command lines, some of them have commands like 'ls -recurse' or 'get-childitem -recurse', which are common directory listing commands. But when combined with 'gci -recurse', it seems like they're recursively searching through directories, maybe looking for something specific.\n\nThe second thing is the tasks in the winlog field. There are mentions of Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. These seem to be various system events related to processes starting, files being created or modified, and registry changes. \n\nI also notice that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing different parts of the filesystem and registry. For example, one event shows a file being created in the Windows Defender directory, which might be legitimate, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious.\n\nThere's another process named winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log management tools like Elastic's WinlogBeat, used for forwarding logs to Elasticsearch. It's creating files and possibly setting registry values. That in itself isn't malicious, unless it's being misused or there's an irregularity in how it's operating.\n\nThen there are events where conhost.exe is involved in a Registry value set task. Conhost is typically associated with command-line interfaces, so that's another point to consider—malware often uses legitimate tools for their activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with various commands and the combination of file creation, registry changes, and process access could indicate malicious activity. It might be part of an attack chain where an adversary is using PowerShell to gather information (like listing files), establishing persistence (registry modifications), or dropping files.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if all these activities are malicious. Sometimes legitimate scripts or tools can trigger similar events. But the pattern of multiple powershell.exe processes with varied commands and file\/registry interactions does raise concerns. Also, the presence of other processes like winlogbeat.exe could be coincidental or part of a larger attack.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of events suggests possible malicious behavior. The confidence isn't 100%, but it's high enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with varied commands, file\/registry interactions suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
