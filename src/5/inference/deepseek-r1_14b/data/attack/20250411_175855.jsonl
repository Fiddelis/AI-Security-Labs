{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what they might mean.\n\nFirst, there are three events here. The first one shows that powershell.exe was accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both legitimately and maliciously. It's commonly targeted by attackers because it allows for script execution and can do a lot of things under the hood. So, seeing it being accessed might raise some flags.\n\nThe second event is whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows utility that displays information about the current user. On its own, executing this isn't suspiciousâ€”it's often used to check permissions or credentials. However, when combined with other actions, especially from something like powershell.exe, it could be part of a larger script or command.\n\nThe third event again shows powershell.exe being accessed. So we have two instances where PowerShell is being run. The repetition makes me think that maybe this is part of a loop or multiple commands within a script. This could indicate something more than just casual use.\n\nLooking at the events together, I'm noticing that there's an alternation between accessing PowerShell and running whoami.exe. If these were separate users or unrelated processes, it might not be as concerning, but since they're part of the same batch, perhaps this is a script executing multiple commands. That could mean someone is using elevated privileges to gather information about the system, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm also considering whether the confidence level should be high. Given that PowerShell is often used in attacks and whoami.exe can provide useful info, the combination could be part of an attack chain. The confidence isn't super high because each event on its own isn't necessarily malicious, but together they suggest potential malicious activity.\n\nSo overall, I think this batch is interesting enough to investigate further because it combines the use of PowerShell with a system information tool, which are common in attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple accesses to powershell.exe and execution of whoami.exe, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the batch of system log events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved:\n\n1. **winlogbeat.exe** appears twice, creating files. This seems normal as it's likely a logging service.\n2. **RuntimeBroker.exe** sets a registry value. That's common for Windows services and shouldn't be suspicious on its own.\n3. **notepad.exe** setting a registry value might be unusual but not necessarily malicious if Notepad is being used for some legitimate task.\n4. **powershell.exe** accessing processes and later setting registry values. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so this could be a red flag depending on the context.\n5. **calc.exe** loading urlmon.dll, which seems normal since it's part of Windows System32.\n6. **svchost.exe**, appearing multiple times setting registry values. SvcHost is a common host process for services, so such activity isn't concerning unless there are unusual patterns.\n7. **Calculator.exe** loading urlmon.dll again, which should be standard.\n8. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** setting registry values; this is a known Windows process and likely benign.\n9. **chrome.exe** has multiple events: creating pipes, accessing registries, and loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem normal for Chrome's operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths:\n\n- Most files are standard system files or related to legitimate processes like Chrome extensions or antivirus components.\n- The only non-standard path is `.winlogbeat.yml.new`, but this is likely part of the winlogbeat configuration.\n\nThe repeated registry writes by various processes, especially PowerShell and chrome.exe, might warrant closer look. However, without additional context indicating unusual behavior or anomalies (like timestamps clustering, unexpected users, etc.), these events appear within normal operational parameters.\n\nThus, while there are some points to consider, they don't collectively suggest malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of standard system activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and process loading of common DLLs. No unusual patterns or signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event is MpDefenderCoreService.exe with a network connection detected. That seems normal since it's part of Windows Defender, probably checking for updates or scanning.\n\nNext, there are multiple chrome.exe entries with network connections. Browsers connecting to the internet is standard behavior; no red flags here.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe accessing processes and registry events, I should be cautious. PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks but also by attackers. The RegistryEvent could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nThere's a whoami.exe process created, which is usually harmless unless it's being misused to gather user information. Then, cmd.exe with some commands. The command lines show \"dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key\" and \"| findstr \/e .key\". This looks suspicious because it's searching for files ending with .key, possibly looking for keys or credentials. Using cmd to search through directories could be part of data exfiltration.\n\nThere are also multiple registry writes from cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be indicators of malicious activity, such as creating persistence points or altering system settings without user consent.\n\nWinlogbeat is a known tool for log management; its events creating files don't seem concerning on their own.\n\nThe file creation by powershell.exe could be writing to the disk, potentially storing malicious scripts or configurations. This combined with registry changes might suggest an attacker trying to establish persistence or modify system behavior.\n\nI notice several instances where processes are accessing the registry and creating files. The repeated use of cmd.exe with specific commands targeting .key files is concerning because it might indicate credential harvesting.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities: suspicious process creations, registry modifications, and file searches that could be looking for sensitive information. These actions don't seem to align with normal user behavior and could be signs of an attack. Therefore, the batch should be classified as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious activities such as repeated network connections from Chrome, registry modifications by PowerShell and cmd.exe, and a command searching for .key files which could indicate credential harvesting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
