{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let's start by looking at each one carefully.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems pretty benign; it's often used just to check user information. Nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext up are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. The second and third events show that powershell.exe accessed something, but without more context, I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, the command line for powershell.exe catches my eye. It's using some findstr and select-string commands searching for \"password\" patterns in various file types. That sounds like it could be trying to extract sensitive information. Definitely a red flag.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with other actions. I'll need to keep an eye on that.\n\nThe next few events show powershell.exe loading various image files. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the specific paths and DLLs being loaded could be part of a larger malicious routine. It's worth noting but not immediately concerning unless we see more.\n\nThen there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PS1 script in the user's AppData folder. Creating and then deleting a script file might be an attempt to hide traces, which is a common tactic in malware or APTs. This adds to the suspicion level.\n\nMultiple events show powershell.exe being executed with the same suspicious command line. Repetitive process creations with malicious-looking commands suggest automated or malicious activity trying to stay under the radar by repeating actions that might not be flagged individually but together are concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for sensitive data, create temporary files, and access registry entries suggests a potential attack. The batch shows behavior consistent with data exfiltration or credential harvesting. Even though each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination points towards malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious commands and accessing sensitive system components suggest possible unauthorized activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the batch of system log events provided is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from 'chrome.exe'. There are a lot of tasks related to registry value sets, which seems normal because Chrome probably interacts with the Windows Registry when it runs. Then there are some DNS queries, which also make sense since browsers do a lot of DNS lookups for websites.\n\nI notice that the first several events (lines 1-6) are all 'Registry value set' tasks in Chrome. That's pretty standard. Then on line 7 and 8, there are two more DNS queries from Chrome. Moving to line 9, there's a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems okay too; it's just the log beat process setting up its data.\n\nLine 10 is another registry set in Chrome. Line 11 shows that Chrome loaded 'amsi.dll', which is the Antimalware Scan Interface, part of Windows Defender. Loading system DLLs is normal for processes. Then line 12 loads 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender again, so that's also standard.\n\nLines 13-20 are more registry sets and a couple network connections detected in Chrome. Browsing would naturally involve these activities, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nOn line 21, powershell.exe creates a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. That caught my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. Creating a file with that name doesn't inherently mean it's bad, but combined with other behaviors, it could be concerning.\n\nLine 22 is another registry set in Chrome, and line 23 is a DNS query without any associated process name. That might be odd because the process is listed as 'None', which could indicate an anomaly or potential tampering of logs.\n\nSo, considering all events together, while most are normal browser activities, the creation of a file by PowerShell and the last event with no process but a DNS query might point to something malicious. However, without more context, like additional suspicious actions, I'm not entirely certain. But there's enough here that could indicate potential malicious behavior to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry modifications and DNS queries by chrome.exe, as well as a file creation by powershell.exe which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if it's interesting or not. There are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\n1. The first event has a process named powershell.exe with a specific command line that includes searching for 'pass' in various file types. This might be concerning because it looks like it's searching for sensitive information.\n\n2. The second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is probably normal since it's part of log management.\n\n3. Notepad.exe setting a registry value—nothing unusual there.\n\n4. Another powershell.exe accessing something, could be benign or malicious depending on the context.\n\n5. Calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL, so that seems okay.\n\n6. Powershell.exe again, loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a good sign as it's part of antivirus software.\n\n7. Another powershell.exe event with the same command line as the first one, which could indicate repeated suspicious activity.\n\n8. Svchost.exe setting registry values—svchost is commonly used by services, but sometimes malware uses it too. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\n9. More svchost.exe events doing the same thing. Could be part of normal operation or something else.\n\n10. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again, which as before seems normal.\n\n11. Findstr.exe being executed with a command searching for 'pass' in files. Combined with powershell, this might be part of a script trying to gather credentials.\n\n12. OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query—this is likely related to Microsoft updates or checking licenses, so probably benign.\n\n13. Powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This could be writing configuration files, but sometimes attackers use powershell for persistence by placing scripts here.\n\n14. More powershell.exe registry writes, which could be setting up persistence points or altering system configurations.\n\n15. Conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe also modifying registry values. These are legitimate processes, so unless there's something else, it might not be suspicious.\n\n16. Calculator.exe again modifying the registry—this is unusual for such a basic application and might indicate tampering.\n\n17-20. Chrome events: pipe creation and registry writes. Browsers often do these things, so likely normal activity unless linked to other malicious events.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice multiple powershell.exe processes with potentially suspicious command lines searching for passwords. The repeated use of findstr.exe looking for sensitive terms adds concern. Additionally, several registry modifications by different processes might indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. While some activities are benign, the combination raises flags about possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity and findstr.exe searching for sensitive terms, combined with registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events from a system. The goal is to determine if these logs are interesting enough for further investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where `winlogbeat.exe` is creating files. That makes sense because WinlogBeat is an agent that collects logs, so it's normal for it to write configuration or data files periodically. The paths mentioned are typical locations where such tools might store their configurations, like `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see multiple instances of `powershell.exe` performing different tasks. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by administrators, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers. One event shows `powershell.exe` creating a file named `estrutura_ativo.txt` in the Downloads folder. That caught my attention because dropping files into user directories might indicate malicious activity, like downloading content or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are several entries where `powershell.exe` is accessing processes and registry events. For example, one event shows it accessing a process (ProcessAccess), another sets a registry value (RegistryEvent). These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with other activities, they could be red flags. Registry modifications can be part of persistence techniques or installing malware.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple `cmd.exe` instances running commands to delete scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines show deletions of specific task names like `\"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\"` and `\"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\"`. Deleting tasks can be part of cleaning up after malicious activities, preventing detection by system admins. This behavior is concerning because it suggests someone is trying to remove traces of their actions.\n\nAdditionally, `schtasks.exe` is used both to create and delete tasks. The creation of new tasks with names like `\"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\"` might be part of establishing persistence. If these tasks are scheduled to run on logon or startup, they could execute malicious code each time the system starts up.\n\nThere's also an instance where `svchost.exe` modifies registry objects. Since svchost is a legitimate Windows process used by services, any unusual registry activity from it might be worth investigating further, as it could indicate a compromised service or a rootkit.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple entries of `conhost.exe` modifying the registry. Conhost is another system executable, often used by console applications. Unusual behavior here could signal malicious activities, such as creating new services or modifying existing ones.\n\nPutting all these together: we have multiple processes (powershell, cmd) performing file operations and registry modifications, deleting scheduled tasks, and creating new ones. These actions collectively suggest potential unauthorized system changes. While each individual event might not be alarming, the combination points towards possible malicious activity, such as setting up persistence mechanisms, downloading files to user directories, and cleaning up logs or tasks to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is interesting enough for investigation because it shows signs that could indicate a breach or attack on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of potentially malicious activities including file creation by PowerShell, registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks suggest possible unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event is a PowerShell process accessing something. Then there are multiple entries about User Account Management and Security Group Management, which seem like normal user activity. But then I see commands like 'net.exe' and 'cmd.exe' deleting users across the domain. That's a red flag because deleting users, especially with administrative names, could be part of an attack to cover tracks.\n\nThere are several instances where different executables like cmd, powershell, net1.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, sc.exe, etc., are being used with specific commands. The repeated use of ' Registry value set' tasks might indicate tampering with system configurations or hiding activities. Also, the deletion of services via 'sc delete' could be an attempt to remove monitoring tools.\n\nThe pattern here shows multiple processes creating and accessing registry entries alongside user deletions. This combination suggests possible malicious activity like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The extensive use of PowerShell and command-line tools for administrative tasks without clear justification raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch definitely seems relevant for investigation as there are signs of potential unauthorized access and system tampering.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of user deletions via command-line tools and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are a lot of processes being created and some file accesses. I notice that cmd.exe and powershell.exe are appearing multiple times. For example, the first event shows cmd.exe running with a command line that deletes notepad.exe using wmic. That seems suspicious because deleting processes can be malicious activity.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is accessed. Powershell is often used by attackers for command execution and script runs. Another event has WMIC.exe being used to delete notepad.exe as well, which reinforces the idea that something is trying to remove or hide traces of other processes.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where Registry values are set. This makes me think that someone might be attempting to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation. The use of net.exe and net1.exe with commands like 'net user \/del' suggests an attempt to delete user accounts, which could indicate account compromise or privilege escalation.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe multiple times. While this is a legitimate command to check permissions, repeated usage without a clear reason might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the pattern seems concerning. The combination of deleting processes (possibly to cover tracks), using powershell and cmd for command execution, modifying registry entries, and attempting user deletions points towards potential malicious activity. These actions could be part of an attack chain, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm a bit unsure because sometimes legitimate scripts might perform similar actions, but the frequency and variety here make it more likely to be malicious. For example, the repeated use of different commands (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe) for process deletion is unusual in normal system operations. Additionally, attempting to delete user accounts could indicate an attempt to elevate privileges or remove evidence.\n\nTaking all this into account, I think the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation because it shows signs that could be part of a cyberattack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including process deletions, registry modifications, and user account manipulations, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where whoami.exe is being executed. This tool usually just outputs the user information, but it can be part of malicious activity if used inappropriately. Then there are multiple powershell.exe processes with different tasks like accessing files or setting registry values. Powershell is commonly used by attackers for its scripting capabilities, so repeated access could indicate something suspicious.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe process deleting files in the Temp directory. The filenames look suspicious, maybe remnants of an executed script or malicious program. Deleting such files might be an attempt to cover tracks. Additionally, there are multiple Registry value sets across different processes—cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of installing persistent malware.\n\nI also see a process with a command line 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems unusual. It's possible this is a way to execute Powershell without it showing up in certain ways, maybe to avoid detection. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks from Powershell could be part of script initialization or persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple process creations with potentially malicious tools, file deletions that might erase evidence, registry modifications for persistence, and unusual Powershell usage patterns. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with tasks like Image loaded and File created. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this might be a red flag. The files being accessed are some DLLs and .ps1 scripts in temporary directories, which could indicate script execution.\n\nThere's an event where a file __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. This behavior seems suspicious because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious code without leaving traces. The deletion might be an attempt to cover their tracks.\n\nAnother point is the process creation of whoami.exe, which is typically used to check user permissions. If this is executed in conjunction with powershell, it could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI also notice that some events are from winlogbeat.exe, which is an agent for collecting Windows logs. The creation of its configuration file might not be suspicious on its own but combined with other activities, it could indicate log tampering or attempts to cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the tasks: ImageLoad, FileCreate, ProcessAccess, and RegistryEvent. These are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the combination of multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe and subsequent file operations raises concern about potential malware loading components.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe suggest that other processes might be interacting with it, possibly hooking into its process to inject code or monitor its execution.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a series of activities that could indicate malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, I notice several instances where `whoami.exe` is being executed. Specifically, there are events showing the creation of this process with its command line path correctly pointing to `C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe`. While `whoami.exe` is a legitimate tool used to display user information, multiple executions might be worth noting depending on the context. However, without additional indicators of compromise (like unusual account access or time stamps), this could just be normal user activity.\n\nNext up are several entries related to `powershell.exe`. These events show that PowerShell processes were accessed but don't provide details about what commands were executed. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated accesses without specific actions might not raise immediate red flags unless they're part of a larger suspicious pattern.\n\nThen there are instances where various system processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `Calculator.exe` are interacting with the registry or loading DLLs. These activities aren't unusual on their own, as many applications require registry access for proper functioning. However, repeated registry writes could be a sign of configuration changes, which might warrant closer examination.\n\nI also see entries from `svchost.exe`, which is a known process that hosts various system services. The fact that it's writing to the registry multiple times isn't inherently suspicious unless these actions are outside normal operational parameters for the specific service instances running.\n\nThere's an event involving `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in a user directory. This could be part of log shipping or data collection processes, which is more about monitoring than anything malicious, so it doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nThe `chrome.exe` entries show multiple DNS queries and network connections. While this aligns with normal browser behavior (navigating to websites), if the domain queried appears suspicious or if there's an unusual volume of requests, that could be a red flag. But in this case, without specific details about the domains involved, it's hard to classify these as malicious.\n\nLooking at all these events collectively, I don't see any clear signs of malicious behavior like known malicious process names, unexpected file creations, or unusual network destinations. The activities are mostly within the realm of normal user operations and common application behaviors. While some processes might raise eyebrows on their own (like multiple PowerShell accesses), without additional context or more specific indicators, it's difficult to classify this batch as suspicious.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events together, I don't find enough evidence to suggest that they're indicative of malicious activity or something out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, registry access, and file operations without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
