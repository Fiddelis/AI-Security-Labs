{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user has given me a JSONL file with multiple entries, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event is \"whoami.exe\" being executed. That seems normal; it's often used to check the current user or permissions, so not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be both a legitimate tool and commonly exploited for malicious activities. The command lines here look suspicious because they're using 'findstr' to search for keywords like \"pass\" in various file types (xml, doc, txt, xls). This seems like it's trying to find sensitive information, which could indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nLooking at the events, I see that powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading several images. While some of these actions are normal for PowerShell scripts, the repeated use and specific command lines make me raise an eyebrow. Additionally, there's a file being created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory, which might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks without any corresponding process creation or other events. This could mean that something is trying to stay under the radar, perhaps loading malicious components without creating new processes that would be easily spotted.\n\nThere's also a file being created related to winlogbeat.exe, which I assume is part of their log management setup. Not too concerning unless it's misconfigured. The notepad.exe and calc.exe events seem benign, just regular process activities.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated powershell.exe activity with specific command-line arguments that search for sensitive data, combined with suspicious file creation\/deletion patterns and provider lifecycle events, strongly suggests potential malicious behavior. This batch of logs shows signs of possible unauthorized access or data theft.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts searching for sensitive information in various file types, combined with suspicious file creation and deletion activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The keys are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll — PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but sometimes it's just legitimate use. MpClient.dll sounds like part of Windows Defender, which is legitimate.\n\n2. powershell.exe command line has a string searching for 'pass' in various files — This could be suspicious because searching for passwords or sensitive info might indicate data theft. The command uses findstr and select-string, which are common tools but can also be malicious.\n\n3. svchost.exe setting registry values — SvcHost is a legitimate process, often used by services, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\n4. Another svchost.exe event doing the same thing as above — Could just be normal service activity.\n\n5. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll — Calculator is typically benign, but sometimes malware can masquerade as it. However, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component for URL handling.\n\n6. findstr.exe being called with specific arguments to search for 'pass' in various file types — Similar to the second event, this might be part of malicious activity to extract credentials.\n\n7. powershell.exe accessed and created a file in the StartupProfileData directory — This could be an attempt to persist across reboots by placing scripts or configurations there. That's concerning because it can lead to persistent malware.\n\n8. OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query — Could be normal activity, but sometimes attackers use DNS for command and control communications.\n\n9. Another powershell.exe instance creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory — This repetition might indicate an ongoing or persistent process, which is more suspicious.\n\n10. conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting registry values — These processes are legitimate, often related to console windows and application frameworks.\n\n11. Calculator.exe again accessing the registry — As before, while not necessarily malicious, repeated registry access by Calculator might warrant attention if combined with other events.\n\n12. chrome.exe performing multiple registry writes and DNS queries — Chrome is a common process; however, many instances of registry writes could indicate something amiss, especially if they're part of an exploit or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at the overall picture:\n\n- Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines, searching for sensitive information like passwords.\n- Creation of files by powershell.exe in the StartupProfileData directory, which is a common tactic for persistence.\n- Repetitive registry modifications by various processes, including legitimate ones, but in combination with other events, could indicate malicious activity.\n- The use of findstr and select-string within powershell commands adds to the suspicion as they're often used to extract information.\n\nI'm considering whether these activities are indicative of an attack. The repeated attempts to search for passwords, coupled with file creation in Startup directories by powershell.exe, suggest possible credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms. While some events could be legitimate (like svchost and chrome activity), the combination points towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system events exhibits several red flags that collectively suggest potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to search for sensitive information using `findstr` and `select-string`. These activities are concerning as they could be part of credential harvesting.\n\n2. **File Creation in Startup Directory**: Powershell.exe creating files in the `StartupProfileData` directory, a common tactic for persistence across system reboots, indicating possible malware attempting to maintain access.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**: Several processes, including legitimate ones like `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`, showing multiple registry writes. While not inherently malicious, the frequency combined with other suspicious activities raises concerns.\n\n4. **Use of Tools for Information Extraction**: The use of `findstr.exe` to search for sensitive terms in various files, which is often associated with malicious intent to gather credentials or data.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these events—suspicious command-line arguments in PowerShell, file creation in startup directories, repetitive registry modifications, and the use of tools for information extraction—indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. This batch of events should be investigated further to determine if an attack is occurring."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format with each line being a JSON object.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see events from chrome.exe involving image loading, registry changes, and network connections. These seem normal as Chrome often loads images and communicates over the network. There's also an event where a file named MpOAV.dll is loaded by Chrome. This file is related to Windows Defender, which is legitimate.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of 'Registry value set' tasks in chrome.exe. While unusual, they might be due to some extension or update. However, the frequency could raise a flag but not necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe creates files and accesses processes. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, so this could be concerning. Specifically, creating files like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt' without clear context might be suspicious.\n\nThere are also events involving cmd.exe with command lines that delete scheduled tasks. The commands use schtasks to delete specific tasks. This behavior is often seen in malware attempting to remove competition or persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag.\n\nFurthermore, there's an event where 'whoami.exe' is executed. While this can be benign for checking user information, it's also used by attackers to gather system details.\n\nThe presence of schtasks.exe creating and deleting tasks adds to the concern, as task deletion without legitimate cause can indicate malicious activity aiming to remove traces or establish persistence.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe accessing registry events is notable since it's a common process but often exploited by malware for persistence and privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of multiple tools (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe), file creations, process access, and task deletions—it seems like the batch shows signs of potential malicious activity. The combination suggests possible attack vectors such as credential dumping, persistence removal, or system information gathering.\n\nHowever, without more context on the specific tasks deleted or the contents of the created files, it's hard to definitively classify this as malicious. It could also be a legitimate administrative task, though given the frequency and variety of actions, it leans towards suspicious.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, I'm moderately confident that this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple activities including file creation by PowerShell, registry modifications, network connections from Chrome, and deletion of scheduled tasks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where schtasks.exe is being used with commands like \/delete and specific task names. That stands out because schtasks is often used for scheduling tasks, but deleting them without legitimate reason could be suspicious. It might indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activity or prevent logging.\n\nThen I see several entries from cmd.exe, especially ones with command lines that delete processes using wmic and net commands. For example, deleting notepad.exe processes and user accounts like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Using cmd to delete processes and users is something an attacker might do to clean up after themselves or escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity from powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. Powershell is a powerful tool often used in scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes like executing commands or avoiding detection. The repeated process accesses could be part of a script trying to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nAdditionally, WMIC.exe is being used with commands that delete processes and load various DLLs. WMIC is another tool that's legitimate but often misused by attackers for command execution and process management. The fact that it's loading different system files might be normal, but combined with other activities, it raises flags.\n\nRegistry events are happening frequently too. Modifying registry values can be part of installing malware or changing system configurations to allow persistence. Tools like whoami.exe and conhost.exe being used could also be part of privilege escalation or creating new processes under different credentials.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of process creation, deletion, and registry modifications. These activities don't seem to align with normal user behavior. They look more like someone trying to remove traces, escalate privileges, or set up persistence mechanisms. The combination of using multiple tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, WMIC.exe) and the types of commands executed (deleting tasks, processes, users) suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm also noticing that some of these events are repeated, which could indicate a script running multiple times to achieve certain goals. This repetition isn't typical in legitimate user activities but is common in automated attacks or scripts designed to cause harm.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows signs of potentially unauthorized access and system manipulation, which makes it interesting for investigation purposes. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present across different tools and operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including process deletions, user account removals, and registry modifications using various tools like schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, sc.exe, and services.exe are being executed with specific command lines. The tasks logged include things like \"Registry value set,\" \"Process accessed,\" \"Process Create,\" \"User Account Management,\" and \"Security Group Management.\"\n\nLooking at cmd.exe, I notice several instances where it's used to execute commands. For example, one event shows cmd.exe deleting a user account: \"\/c net user \\\"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\\\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". Another deletes a service using \"sc delete win32times.\" These actions are concerning because they involve administrative operations that could be part of malicious activities, like creating or deleting users or services.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with tasks indicating it's being accessed. Powershell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and can execute commands that might be obfuscated or malicious.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is run without any arguments, which in some cases could be normal, but repeated use might indicate someone checking permissions or trying to identify the system's identity.\n\nThere are several events related to user account management and security groups. The deletion of user accounts via net.exe and net1.exe is a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting accounts they created. Similarly, modifying services with sc.exe could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the Registry activity, there are multiple instances where registry values are being set or objects are added\/deleted. This can be a sign of malware attempting to modify system configurations or install components.\n\nThe combination of these events—deleting user accounts, modifying services, and extensive Registry changes—is significant. These actions don't seem like normal user behavior and could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or erase evidence.\n\nI'm also noting that while some processes are benign on their own (like whoami.exe), the frequency and combination with other activities make them suspicious. The use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe in these specific ways is a common tactic for adversaries.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious activity: user deletions, service modifications, Registry changes, and repeated use of powerful tools. These collectively suggest that an investigation would be warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as user account deletions, service removals, and registry modifications, which are often associated with attacker behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe processes. Both are common tools for legitimate use but can also be used maliciously. For example, the first event has powershell.exe accessing something via 'Process accessed', which is normal but could be suspicious if it's not expected behavior.\n\nLooking at the second event, cmd.exe is deleting files in a temp directory. This might be part of cleaning up after some task runs, but without more context, I'm not sure. Also, there are several instances where cmd.exe is setting registry values and deleting files, which could indicate an attempt to remove traces or modify system settings.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe, which is often used by attackers to check permissions or gather information about the current user. It's a red flag when combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nPowershell.exe is being created multiple times and accessing various registry entries and files. The fact that it's loading several .NET framework components might be normal, but the repeated 'Registry value set' tasks could suggest something malicious, like installing persistence mechanisms or modifying security settings.\n\nI notice a file creation and then deletion of a PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest...). This is concerning because attackers often create temporary scripts to execute commands and then delete them to cover their tracks. The combination of creating and deleting such files might indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the logs from powershell.exe could be signs that PowerShell is being used for something more complex, possibly malicious scripts or modules loading.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple processes with potential malicious activities: deleting files, modifying registry, using whoami, creating\/deleting script files. These are indicators of possible attack behavior. However, some events like file deletions could be legitimate system tasks, so I'm not entirely certain without more context. But overall, the pattern looks concerning enough to classify it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, file deletions, and the use of command-line tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe in a potentially malicious manner.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data, there are multiple entries with different processes and tasks. The main thing that stands out is the repeated use of `powershell.exe` along with other activities like creating files and accessing registries. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nI notice several events where `powershell.exe` creates new files, loads images, and accesses processes. For example, there are file creations in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory. This could mean someone is trying to persistence their access or perform some malicious activities using scripts. Also, the repeated use of whoami.exe might be an attempt to gather information about the system's user.\n\nAnother point is that multiple instances where `Registry value set` tasks occur with various processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe. These are legitimate processes but frequent registry changes can indicate tampering or installation of malicious software.\n\nAdditionally, there are some normal activities like winlogbeat creating a config file and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which seems harmless. But these are outweighed by the suspicious powershell activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern suggests possible malicious behavior, so I'd classify this batch as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution or information gathering. Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications that may suggest system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the data directory with a .winlogbeat.yml.new extension. That seems normal since Winlogbeat is responsible for collecting logs, so it might be updating its configuration file. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers, but it's also legitimate for admins. However, without seeing actual command-line arguments or more context, it's hard to tell if this access was malicious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a standard tool to get user information, so unless it's used in an unusual way, like with some extra parameters, it's probably not suspicious here.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event follows, again without command details. This could be part of a script or legitimate admin work, but again, no clear signs of misuse yet.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both made registry changes. ApplicationFrameHost is related to Windows apps, so that seems normal. Calculator is a standard app; it's unlikely to do anything malicious with the registry unless there's an unusual value being set.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe entries: multiple DNS queries and network connections. Chrome often connects to various domains for browsing, so these could be legitimate user activity. Unless they're connecting to known bad domains, which I don't see here, this doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together, none of the events on their own seem particularly malicious. The only thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe without command lines, but without more context, it's hard to assess. However, there's no clear indication of unauthorized access or malicious activity across the entire batch.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch contains normal system activities with no evident signs of malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events include legitimate processes like Winlogbeat updating configuration, PowerShell access (without commands), and standard application behaviors. No evidence of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
