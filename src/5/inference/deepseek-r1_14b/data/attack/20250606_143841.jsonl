This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process running, which is another tool often used by attackers to check system information. The combination of multiple PowerShell activities with registry modifications and file deletions raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like someone is trying to execute scripts stealthily, possibly exfiltrating data or installing malware.

I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first few entries are about processes being created or accessed. Notably, there's cmd.exe with a command line that seems suspicious because it's just \"\/c\" without any arguments. That could be a red flag.\n2. Then there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script downloading, so repeated instances might indicate malicious activity.\n3. There are file creation events in temporary directories (like C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp), which could be a sign of script execution or dropping malware components.\n4. A file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1 is created and then deleted. This seems unusual, especially if it's a PowerShell script. The naming suggests an attempt to bypass certain policies or test script execution permissions.\n5. There are also registry accesses and image loads related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender components. While this isn't immediately suspicious, the combination with other events might raise concerns about process injection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances, file creations\/deletions in temp directories, a deleted script file, and command line anomalies could indicate an attempt at executing malicious scripts or setting up persistence.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity from `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so the volume here could be significant. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed, which might indicate script execution or other operations.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one entry shows powershell.exe executing a script that checks if `procdump.exe` exists in a specific directory. If it doesn't, the script exits with code 1; otherwise, it exits with 0. This behavior is unusual because procdump.exe is typically used for debugging and process dumping. The script's attempt to check for its presence might be a precursor to downloading or executing it later, which could be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's file creation and deletion activity. Powershell creates a temporary PS1 file, runs some operations, and then deletes it. This pattern is often seen in attempts to avoid detection by leaving fewer traces on the system. The fact that the file is created and immediately deleted adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe batch also includes process creations for `whoami.exe`, which could be used to gather information about the current user or system, potentially for reconnaissance purposes. Combined with the powershell activities, this might indicate an attack chain where initial access is followed by lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point of interest is the registry value set event in one of the entries. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms to ensure malicious scripts run on subsequent boots, making it a red flag for potential malware activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern that suggests possible malicious behavior: repeated powershell executions with specific commands, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications. These actions collectively are indicative of an attack rather than normal user or system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes accessing various files and registry values, along with process creations and deletions, indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. That immediately stands out because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed, sometimes with specific command lines.\n\nOne event shows that powershell.exe was run with a command line that includes \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". That part looks suspicious because it's creating a new PowerShell drive mapped to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\", which could indicate an attempt to access another system or a shared resource. This might be an indicator of remote command execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\nAdditionally, there are several instances where files are being created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Specifically, a file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\" is created and then deleted. Creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection, especially if it's part of testing script execution policies.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity related to loading various DLLs into memory. While PowerShell does load several modules and libraries when running scripts, the combination here might indicate that malicious scripts are being executed. The different ImageLoad events could suggest the loading of components necessary for executing commands or lateral movement.\n\nFurthermore, there are registry value sets by powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be a sign of persistence mechanisms, where attackers set up registry keys to ensure their malicious activities continue after a system restart.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that whoami.exe is being executed twice. While this could be legitimate for checking user information, in the context of other suspicious PowerShell activity, it might be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system or user credentials.\n\nThe fact that these events are all clustered around powershell.exe and related processes makes me lean towards this batch being indicative of malicious behavior. The creation and deletion of a script file in the Temp directory is especially concerning because it's a common technique used by malware to execute scripts without leaving long-term traces on the system.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities could be part of normal user or admin operations. While some PowerShell usage is routine, the combination of creating\/deleting files quickly, registry modifications, and the specific command line arguments make this batch more suspicious than not.\n\nIn summary, the repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands, coupled with file creation\/deletion in Temp and registry activity, points towards a possible attack. The confidence level isn't 100% but is high enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including suspicious command-line arguments, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is something interesting that needs investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them are related to PowerShell and cmd.exe being used with some commands. For example, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing processes or files. One event shows whoami.exe being run, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of privilege escalation if combined with other actions.\n\nThen I notice that cmd.exe was used with the command \"\/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". That's a red flag because turning off Windows Defender Firewall can help hide malicious activities. Disabling it is often a step attackers take to prevent detection after compromising a system.\n\nThere are also several entries where svchost.exe is modifying registry values and objects. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but it's commonly used by malware to hide their activity because many services run under this host process. The repeated registry changes could be an attempt to create persistence or modify system configurations in a malicious way.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (even though they aren't provided), if these events happened around the same time, it might indicate a sequence of malicious activities. The combination of disabling firewall, using PowerShell for potentially malicious scripts, and svchost.exe registry modifications all together suggests possible unauthorized access or installation of malware.\n\nSo putting this all together: disabling the firewall is risky, PowerShell is often used in attacks, and svchost.exe changes could be part of persistence mechanisms. These factors make the batch quite concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including disabling firewall, use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious commands, and registry modifications via svchost.exe which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are from svchost.exe with tasks related to Registry object changes. Svchost is a common process, often associated with services in Windows, so some registry activity isn't unusual. But there are 17 instances of this, which seems like a lot. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just normal operation.\n\nThen, looking further down, I see events where powershell.exe is being executed with the command line argument: \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". The task types are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. Using PowerShell for drive mappings isn't inherently suspicious, but I should check if this is a common activity or if it's part of an attack.\n\nThe command seems to be creating a new PowerShell drive (g:) pointing to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\". This looks like it might be accessing another system over the network, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack. The fact that multiple events show this command line suggests repeated attempts or maybe part of a script.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and several PowerShell commands creating remote drives. While each event on its own might not raise red flags, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity, like setting up persistence mechanisms or lateral movement in a network.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because of the repetitive and potentially suspicious actions across multiple processes. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context, so my confidence is around 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry and powershell.exe executing commands to create network drives suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and there are two identical ones here. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's a process event where PowerShell is being executed with a command line that includes an if-else statement checking if a specific file exists. The path mentioned is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". So, the script checks if this file exists; if it does, it exits with 0, else 1.\n\nThe second event is exactly the same as the first one. Both have no file information attached.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether these events together are interesting. The command itself isn't inherently malicious, but repeated attempts could indicate something suspicious, like a script trying multiple times to access a file that might not exist or testing permissions.\n\nHowever, since both events are identical and there's no additional context about other activities around this time, it's hard to tell if they're part of normal operations or an attack. It's possible the user is running a script for legitimate purposes, like checking for updates or configurations.\n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether such PowerShell activity is common in the system. If unusual, it might be interesting; if not, then not so much. But with no extra info, I have to make an educated guess based solely on these two events.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think it's somewhat interesting but not certain. My confidence would be around 0.5 because there's potential for concern, but without more data, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains two identical PowerShell commands checking for the existence of a specific file. Such repeated attempts could indicate an attempt to access restricted files or test system configurations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of 24 system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Let me go through them one by one and see what they're telling me.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that all of them have similar structures. The process name is 'svchost.exe' every time. That's interesting because svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used for hosting services. However, it's known to be commonly used by malware as well since many malicious programs can create processes that mimic legitimate ones.\n\nNext, each event has an entry in the winlog field indicating that a Registry object was added or deleted. The rule associated with this task is 'RegistryEvent'. So these events are all about changes made to the Windows Registry. Now, why would svchost.exe be making changes to the registry multiple times? I know that some legitimate services do modify the registry, but repeated writes might raise a red flag.\n\nLooking deeper, each event is identical in structure and content. There's no variation in the process name or the type of log entry. If this were a legitimate operation, I'd expect maybe different tasks or varying parameters. The consistency suggests that this could be part of an automated or malicious script designed to make repeated registry changes without any variation.\n\nI'm also noticing that there are 24 such events in a row. That seems like a lot for normal system activity. Legitimate processes usually don't generate so many identical log entries unless something is wrong, but malware often does this to try to blend in or to create a persistent presence on the system.\n\nAnother point is the absence of any file-related data. The file field in each JSON object is marked as None. This means that no files were accessed or modified during these events. If svchost.exe were doing something malicious, I'd expect it to interact with files for tasks like downloading payloads or storing configuration information. But since there's nothing there, maybe the focus is purely on registry modifications.\n\nPutting this all together, each event is an instance of svchost.exe making a registry change. The repetition and consistency might indicate that this process is trying to establish persistence or modify system configurations in a way that's hard to trace. Malware often uses registry keys for persistence, so these changes could be part of installing itself on the system.\n\nI'm considering whether these events are indicative of malicious activity. While svchost.exe isn't inherently bad, its frequent and repeated use alongside registry modifications is suspicious. The number of entries also stands out, making me think that this batch might indeed be from a compromised system.\n\nHowever, I should also consider legitimate scenarios where svchost.exe would make multiple registry changes. It's possible for some services to update their registry keys during startup or runtime. But 24 identical events in quick succession seem excessive even for legitimate purposes.\n\nAnother angle is the possibility of logging errors or debug information. Maybe these events are part of a debugging process where the same task is logged multiple times, but that doesn't align with the 'Registry object added or deleted' task being repeated so many times without other context.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of repetitive registry changes by svchost.exe is a red flag for potential malicious activity. The high frequency and identical nature of each event make it unlikely to be normal system behavior, especially since there's no variation or additional context in the logs.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that this batch is relevant for investigation due to these signs of possible unauthorized access or malicious code on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events showing svchost.exe making registry changes may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system events. So, there are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event from the Windows event log. The user wants me to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Starting with the first few entries, I notice that the process command line is powershell.exe being executed with some arguments. The task in the winlog field varies between 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. These tasks are related to how PowerShell handles different stages of its operation.\n\nLooking closer at the first event, the command line has a Powershell script attempting to create a new PS drive using New-PSDrive with the parameter -unidade_auxiliar pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems a bit suspicious. Creating a new drive in Windows could be part of legitimate administration tasks, but it might also indicate an attempt to access a remote system or modify drive mappings, which could be malicious.\n\nThe next several events show powershell.exe being called with empty curly braces, like 'powershell.exe & {}'. This is interesting because executing Powershell with an empty command can sometimes be used as part of a larger script execution or to bypass certain security measures. However, without additional context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen, towards the middle and end of the batch, there are events where the command line is more complex. They're checking whether a specific file exists at \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\" using Test-Path. The script exits with 0 if the file exists and 1 otherwise. This could be part of a larger script to ensure that certain tools are present before proceeding, which might indicate malicious activity like dropping additional files or preparing for an attack.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: there's a mix of Powershell commands, some of which seem legitimate but others that raise red flags. The initial attempt to create a new PS drive could be an attempt to access a remote system or change drive mappings in a way that might not be authorized. The later parts with checking for procdump.exe could indicate that the attacker is trying to ensure their tools are present, possibly leading up to executing them.\n\nAdditionally, the frequency of these events—multiple instances within a short period—might suggest automated or scripted behavior, which is often associated with malicious activities. Legitimate administration tasks typically don't execute Powershell scripts in such a repetitive and varied manner unless part of a scheduled task, but even then, they usually aren't checking for specific files across different paths.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level here. While some parts might be innocent, the combination of creating new drive mappings, empty command executions, and file existence checks points towards potential malicious behavior. However, without more context like timestamps or additional log data, it's hard to be 100% certain. But given the patterns observed, there's a moderate confidence that these events merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple Powershell commands including attempts to create new PS drives and check for specific files, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
