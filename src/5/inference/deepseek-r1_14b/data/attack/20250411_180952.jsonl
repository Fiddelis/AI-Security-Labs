{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL logs and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe are making DNS queries and network connections. That's pretty standard for most applications, especially browsers that need to connect to websites. Nothing too suspicious there yet.\n\nThen I see powershell.exe being accessed a few times with different tasks. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has legitimate uses but can be weaponized. The command line in some cases is obfuscated or involves adding users and groups, which might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, there are cmd.exe commands that add users to the domain and add them to the Domain Admins group. This is concerning because adding new admins could mean an attacker is trying to gain higher-level access. The commands use specific usernames like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and passwords like \"registro_temporario_pass123!\", which seem too generic and might be part of a credential dump or brute force attempt.\n\nThere are also entries where net.exe and net1.exe are used similarly, adding users and groups. This repetition is making me think this could be part of an automated attack script trying to create multiple backdoor accounts.\n\nI notice that some processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are creating files. Winlogbeat is likely a legitimate tool for log management, but the file paths seem normal. However, powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_base.txt might be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts.\n\nAnother point is the multiple attempts by svchost.exe to create SRUtmp.log files. Since svchost is a common process that can host various services, it's hard to tell if this is normal activity unless there are signs of deviation from usual patterns.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell and cmd with user-adding commands stands out as malicious activity. These activities could be part of an attack where the attacker is attempting to gain persistent access by creating new admin accounts and possibly exfiltrating data. The combination suggests a potential compromise rather than regular system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations, network connections, and file operations indicate potential malicious activity such as user privilege escalation and data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
