{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of 18 JSONL events. The first thing that stands out is the prevalence of powershell.exe in almost every event. Powershell can be legitimate but it's also commonly used for malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking closer, several events show powershell.exe accessing system resources like registry values and loading various DLLs. This isn't unusual on its own, but when combined with other actions, it raises flags. For instance, creating temporary files in user directories (like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\) suggests the script is doing something that doesn't require admin privileges, which could be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice multiple instances where files are created and then immediately deleted. This behavior often indicates an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or test permissions without leaving evidence. The repetitive pattern of file creation and deletion in these events is concerning.\n\nAdditionally, the command lines show Powershell executing Compress-Archive commands repeatedly with different paths. These commands could be part of data exfiltration attempts, compressing files into ZIPs and sending them elsewhere. However, without seeing where these ZIPs are being sent or who is requesting them, it's hard to confirm.\n\nThe events involving registry access (Registry value set) might be for persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious scripts to survive reboots or hide their presence. This adds to the suspicion because such actions are often part of more sophisticated attacks aiming to maintain control over a system.\n\nWhile some of these activities could be legitimate, like during script testing or system administration tasks, the combination—multiple Powershell executions with similar commands, file operations in temp directories, repeated Compress-Archive calls, and registry modifications—points towards potential malicious behavior. The high number of events related to Powershell and file handling makes the batch particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes executing suspicious commands, including creating temporary files, accessing registry values, and compressing files into ZIP archives in temporary directories. These actions could indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the entries involve PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and script-based attacks. Each PowerShell instance has a command line argument, which includes Compress-Archive commands. This suggests they're trying to compress files into ZIP archives in various directories. The destinations are pointing to TEMP folders with different names like componente_auxiliar.zip or unidade_geral.zip. That's a bit unusual because legitimate processes might not create multiple ZIP files in the same way, especially across different paths.\n\nLooking at other events, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating some file, which is probably part of log management and likely benign. Then, there are entries where Registry values are being set by various processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, etc. These could be normal system operations or signs of malicious activity altering system configurations.\n\nAlso, several instances show \"File created\" events, which might indicate file creation for logs or configuration files. But the repeated ZIP file creations and the use of PowerShell commands make me suspicious. Malware often uses these techniques to package data for exfiltration or to prepare payloads.\n\nThere's also an entry where a process named MpClient.dll is loaded by Windows Defender, which seems normal unless it's being used maliciously. The ImageLoad events are standard but combined with other indicators, they add up.\n\nI'm concerned about the multiple ZIP file creations and the command-line arguments in PowerShell. These could be part of data collection or lateral movement techniques. Additionally, the registry modifications by various processes might be for persistence or to alter system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, the consistent use of PowerShell with Compress-Archive commands across different directories, combined with other process and registry activity, raises flags. It's possible that an attacker is using these techniques to gather information or prepare for further actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands across various directories, combined with other process and registry activities, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries are from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. These seem pretty standard because Chrome often interacts with the registry and loads various DLLs as part of its operation. For example, loading amsi.dll is normal for anti-malware scanning interfaces, which is part of Windows Defender.\n\nThen there's an entry from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely a tool used to collect logs, so this could be it setting up its configuration file. That doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nNext, there are two events from 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, but seeing it accessing processes isn't unusual unless there's suspicious activity like repeated access or combined with other actions.\n\nOne event stands out: 'whoami.exe' being executed. This tool is often used to get system information, which can be part of reconnaissance during an attack. However, in this case, it's just running by itself without any malicious commands or unusual paths. It doesn't have any suspicious arguments, so it might not indicate anything恶意.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, there are no signs of known malicious behaviors like repeated failed logins, writes to system files, or unexpected network connections. The events seem to be part of normal operations—browsing with Chrome, log collection, legitimate use of PowerShell, and a simple system info check.\n\nI don't see any anomalies that would suggest an attack or unauthorized access. Each event can be explained by standard user activities or expected behavior from the software involved. Therefore, while each individual event might seem interesting on its own, together they don't paint a picture of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal system events such as Chrome registry operations, DLL loading, and legitimate process creation. The 'whoami.exe' execution is benign without suspicious command-line arguments.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
