{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of conhost.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, and especially powershell.exe being executed with various command lines. These seem like legitimate system utilities, but the way they're being used might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see a lot of Process Create events for these executables, which isn't unusual on its own. But then there are tasks like Registry value set and Registry object added\/deleted, which make me think that something is modifying system configurations. That could be part of normal operations, but in some cases, it's a red flag.\n\nNotably, powershell.exe appears several times with command lines that aren't clear. For example, one event has \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems odd and possibly indicative of obfuscation or malicious scripting. Powershell is often used by attackers for its powerful scripting capabilities, so repeated usage without clear purpose raises an eyebrow.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple attempts to delete registry entries using cmd.exe and reg.exe. Specifically, the commands target the Run key in the HKCU hive. This might be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms that malware uses to ensure it runs on startup. Such activity could indicate that someone is trying to clean up traces of malicious software or maybe deploying their own.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread out and involve multiple tools suggests a possible campaign rather than isolated incidents. The repeated use of powershell.exe with unclear command lines, combined with registry modifications, makes me think there's something more going on here.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination—especially the powershell usage and registry edits—points towards potential malicious activity or at least something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious process creations (powershell.exe, cmd.exe) with unclear command lines and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing multiple events here, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, a lot of the events involve powershell.exe processes with command lines that download files from GitHub. The URLs point to different paths but all under 'raw.githubusercontent.com'. That's a red flag because downloading files directly from such sources can be a common technique in malicious activities. These could be attempts to fetch scripts or tools.\n\nLooking at the tasks, there are Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for powershell.exe. Those might indicate legitimate operations, but combined with the downloads, it's suspicious. Also, some of these PowerShell instances create files in TEMP directories, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection by keeping files temporary.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome can make such changes during normal operation, repeated Registry modifications without clear purpose might indicate something fishy, especially if it's done by multiple processes.\n\nAnother powershell.exe instance is loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That seems legitimate because Defender uses PowerShell scripts, but sometimes attackers mimic legitimate activities to blend in. I'll have to be cautious here; it could be either benign or malicious.\n\nThere are also some events for conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Conhost is often used by scripts as a host process, which can be part of malicious activities, while winlogbeat might be monitoring logs, which could be normal but sometimes attackers use log monitoring tools to gather data.\n\nThe DNS query event doesn't provide much info on its own, but combined with the other events, it adds up. It's hard to tell if that's related or just normal browsing.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated downloads from GitHub using powershell.exe, file creations in TEMP, and multiple registry modifications are concerning signs of potential malicious behavior. While some activities might be legitimate, the volume and combination suggest an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub repositories and creating temporary files, along with suspicious Chrome registry modifications and a DNS query, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're all from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking and DNS lookups when browsing. So those might just be regular user activity.\n\nThen there's an event involving powershell.exe. The command line has a WebClient downloading a file from GitHub into the TEMP directory. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for scripting, which can be malicious. Also, downloading files from GitHub could be part of legitimate script execution or it might be malicious code.\n\nNext, I see multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is normal for scripts running in PowerShell since they load .NET frameworks and other libraries, but the sheer number makes me think something's up. Maybe the script is doing more than usual.\n\nThere are Registry value sets, which could be setting persistence points or altering system configurations. That's another red flag because attackers often use registry modifications to maintain access.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the TEMP folder. Creating files in TEMP isn't suspicious on its own, but combined with the download and deletion of that file immediately afterward, it looks like an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence. The file is created and then deleted, which might be trying to avoid detection.\n\nThe last few events are more powershell.exe instances downloading different files from GitHub into TEMP. Each time, it's a different repository path but similar commands. This repetition suggests automated or script-based activity, possibly distributing multiple malicious payloads or testing different URLs for delivery.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch shows legitimate Chrome activities but also several signs of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts downloading and executing files, modifying system settings, and trying to cover their tracks by deleting temporary files. The repeated downloading from GitHub under different paths could indicate a campaign trying various methods or evading detection mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of events points toward possible malicious activities, especially the PowerShell downloads and file deletions which are common in attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub into temporary directories, along with registry modifications and file operations that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are a lot of entries from various processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe. These are common tools that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. That's something to note because it means they're versatile but could indicate potential issues if misused.\n\nI see several instances where powershell.exe is involved in tasks like FileCreate, RegistryEvent, and ProcessAccess. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities. If there are multiple events from powershell accessing files or registry entries, it might be a sign of something suspicious, especially if the actions aren't explained.\n\nThere's also an entry where cmd.exe is used with SCHTASKS to delete a task: \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\". This command suggests that someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks are often used by malware to maintain persistence, so deleting them could be an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt legitimate processes.\n\nAdditionally, the use of schtasks.exe in creating and managing tasks is another red flag. Malware frequently uses scheduled tasks to ensure it runs at startup or定期 intervals. If there's a pattern of creating and then deleting tasks, especially with specific names like \"spawn,\" it could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\nI also notice multiple RegistryEvent tasks from various processes. Modifying the registry can be part of installing malware or changing system configurations to allow persistence or privilege escalation. This kind of activity is often seen in attacks, so repeated registry changes might warrant closer investigation.\n\nLooking at other entries, some are related to file creation and loading images like urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate Windows component. However, when combined with the other suspicious activities, even these could be part of an attack vector, such as loading malicious libraries or injecting code into processes.\n\nOverall, while not all events are necessarily bad on their own, the combination of multiple potentially malicious actions (using powershell and cmd for deletion, modifying registry entries, creating\/schtasks.exe) raises concerns. The presence of commands aimed at disrupting system tasks and the use of powerful tools like schtasks.exe without clear justification suggests that this batch might indeed be worth investigating.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these actions are malicious, but given the types of processes and commands involved, it's better to err on the side of caution. Therefore, I classify this as INTERESTING with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple potentially suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process accesses, cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks, and registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The use of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a config file seems normal for log management.\n\nThere are multiple Registry writes by powershell.exe and cmd.exe. That's a bit concerning because attackers can modify system configurations to maintain access or hide their activities.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe could mean it's being used to interact with other processes, which might be part of malicious activity chains.\n\nwhoami.exe is run, which is often used to check permissions or gather system info.

The tasks include things like Registry value sets, Pipe creations, Process accesses, and Image loads.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is involved in multiple activities, such as setting registry values, creating pipes, accessing processes, and loading images. This is concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. However, without specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to say definitively if these actions are malicious.\n\nThere are several Registry value sets across different processes, which could indicate configuration changes. While legitimate software often modifies the registry, repeated modifications might warrant attention. The file creations and image loads seem normal for typical application behavior but don't raise immediate red flags.\n\nOne event stands out: powershell.exe executing a command that deletes a specific ZIP file in the TEMP directory. This deletion could be part of malicious activity, such as removing evidence or cleaning up after an attack. However, without context on why this file exists, it's hard to classify as suspicious.\n\nThe overall pattern shows multiple instances of processes accessing each other and making registry changes, which might suggest some form of automation or script execution. This is more common in a compromised system but could also occur during legitimate operations, especially if PowerShell scripts are being run.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does exhibit behavior that merits closer examination. While not conclusively malicious, there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activities and suspicious file deletions indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to understand what's happening. The first few events involve cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe performing actions like creating processes and accessing registry values. These are common system commands, so individually, they don't raise red flags.\n\nThen, there's a significant number of events related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. I notice that several events show 'Registry value set' tasks, which could be malicious if they're modifying system configurations or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs might indicate the execution of scripts or loading of malicious modules.\n\nThere are also FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events where a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 is created and then deleted. This is suspicious because it suggests some automated testing or potentially malicious activity trying to bypass policy checks by creating, testing, and then deleting files quickly.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell.exe instances have \"& {}\". This might be an attempt to run additional commands or scripts without logging them directly, making it harder to detect. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks are less clear but could be related to PowerShell's own operations, possibly trying to avoid detection by cycling through providers.\n\nCombining all these events, the frequent use of powershell.exe with registry modifications and file manipulations is concerning. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nI'm moderately confident about this assessment because while there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution, the sequence and types of events align with behaviors commonly seen in cyberattacks. However, without more context or additional indicators like known exploit signatures, it's hard to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe show suspicious activity including registry modifications and file creation\/deletion, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being used with command lines that delete files in the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\tarefa_base.txt -Force...\" repeated several times. This pattern suggests that someone might be trying to clean up traces of their activity or remove evidence from the system.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell accesses registry values and processes. Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often use them for persistence mechanisms, like adding startup entries or changing configurations to maintain access.\n\nI also notice that several entries involve file creation and deletion. The script \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\" is created and then deleted. This behavior could indicate a test of script execution policies or an attempt to execute malicious scripts that get removed after use to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, the process \"whoami.exe\" was executed. While this command can be innocent (used to check user permissions), in the context of multiple PowerShell activities, it might be part of privilege escalation attempts or information gathering.\n\nThe repeated usage of PowerShell with different commands and parameters is concerning. Attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities and built-in functionality. The combination of file deletions, registry changes, and process access makes this batch stand out as potentially malicious.\n\nI don't see any direct evidence of data exfiltration or immediate damage in these logs, but the overall pattern—multiple PowerShell commands, file manipulations, and system process accesses—points towards suspicious activity that could be part of an attack chain.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events are related to powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers, so that's something to watch out for.\n\nLooking at the first few events: they show powershell.exe loading various .NET framework files and others. These might just be normal operations if it's a script running. However, the later events catch my attention more.\n\nI see a series of FileCreate and then FileDeleteDetected events in the logs. Specifically, a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a temporary name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Then it's deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is removing files from the TEMP directory using Remove-Item commands. Each command targets different zip files, like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. The fact that it's deleting several files with .zip extensions suggests it might be trying to remove some malicious payloads or evidence.\n\nAlso, there are events labeled as 'Pipe Created' and tasks related to 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These can indicate communication between processes or module loading, which could be part of a larger script execution chain.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that chrome.exe is involved in registry changes and loading some defender-related DLLs. While this might not seem immediately suspicious on its own, combined with the powershell activities, it's something to consider as attackers often use multiple tools to cover their tracks or execute different parts of an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows powershell.exe creating and deleting a script file, which is unusual behavior, especially when followed by multiple deletions of files in TEMP. This could indicate that the script was malicious and tried to clean up after itself. The repeated use of Remove-Item suggests an attempt to remove potentially malicious files, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while the actions are suspicious, they might also be part of a legitimate script's cleanup process. However, the combination of file creation\/deletion and multiple deletions from TEMP raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events showing file creations, deletions, and loading of potentially suspicious modules, along with a series of file removals in the TEMP directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that remove files in the TEMP directory. The commands look like they're deleting specific text files without any error handling. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially file deletions which might cover tracks.\n\nThen, I notice some events related to file creation by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. File creation events aren't inherently bad, but combined with the deletion attempts, it raises questions about what data is being handled or exfiltrated.\n\nThere are also several registry value set tasks from chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. While Chrome can make registry changes, multiple such events might indicate something unusual, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that shouldn't be happening frequently.\n\nLooking at the process names, I see whoami.exe being run twice. This tool is often used to gather system information, which could be part of reconnaissance activities. If this is running without a clear purpose, it might warrant investigation.\n\nThe events involving ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks make me think about potential privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network. These types of activities are common in attacks to gain more access or spread across systems.\n\nPutting all these together, there's a pattern of file manipulation, registry changes, and process monitoring that doesn't seem normal for regular user activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe for deletions and file creation stands out as potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the whoami.exe runs and multiple registry modifications add to the suspicion.\n\nI'm confident enough based on these observations to classify this batch as interesting because it shows signs of possible malicious activities, such as data deletion, system reconnaissance, and potential persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell deletions, registry modifications, and process creations indicate potentially malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided several JSONL entries, each representing an event from the logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. However, seeing powershell.exe access alone isn't necessarily suspicious unless there's unusual activity around it, like accessing sensitive files or running malicious scripts. In this case, the events just mention process access without any file operations or network connections, so I'm not sure if that's concerning yet.\n\nThen there are several Process Create events for whoami.exe. Whoami is a standard Windows utility used to display information about the current user. It’s typically benign and often used by legitimate processes to check permissions or user details. The command line in these events looks normal, pointing directly to the system32 directory, which is expected behavior. No red flags here.\n\nI also see some File Create events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely an agent that's part of an ELK stack for logging, so its activity should be expected if it's running as intended. The file paths mentioned seem to be related to the software's data directory and a text file named pacote_ativo.txt. Without knowing more about what this file contains or why it's being created by powershell.exe, it's hard to say if that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at all events together, there doesn't seem to be any combination of actions that raise alarms. No high privilege escalations, no network communications, and no indication of data exfiltration or known malicious file operations. The repetition of process accesses might suggest some automated tasking, but without context on what's normal for this system, it could just be legitimate activity.\n\nOn the other hand, powershell.exe is a common tool for attackers, so any investigation should keep an eye out for it. But in isolation and with no additional indicators, these events don't cross into suspicious territory. The confidence level isn't very high because while each event alone is somewhat notable, together they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the events, I'd classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" for investigation since there's no evidence of malicious activity or anomalies that stand out when considering the entire log.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated process accesses and creations, including powershell.exe and whoami.exe, which are not inherently suspicious.
