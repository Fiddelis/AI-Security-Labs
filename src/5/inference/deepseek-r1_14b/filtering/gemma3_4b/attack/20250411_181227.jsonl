{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event to see what's happening. There are several entries where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. The commands all seem similar but have different names for the tasks: \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. Each of these tasks is setting up a new scheduled task using Powershell's New-ScheduledTaskAction, triggering at logon, and running with high privileges as BUILTIN\\Administrators.\n\nThis pattern stands out because creating multiple scheduled tasks that run on logon with admin rights could be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Typically, attackers set up such tasks to ensure their malicious code runs every time the user logs in, which is a common tactic for long-term access.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where Powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies registry values, which aligns with how scheduled tasks might store configurations or create triggers. These actions can be stealthy and hard to detect unless monitored closely.\n\nOther events in the batch include normal activities like Chrome creating pipes and loading images, which don't raise any red flags on their own. However, the repeated Powershell activity is concerning because it's often used for executing malicious scripts due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to bypass certain security measures.\n\nThe fact that all these scheduled tasks are being created in quick succession is another point of interest. Legitimate use of Powershell for administrative tasks usually doesn't involve creating multiple similar scheduled tasks, especially with such specific naming conventions that don't seem to have an obvious purpose.\n\nConsidering the overall picture, this batch shows a potential attempt to establish persistence on the system using scheduled tasks created by Powershell. The combination of multiple task creations, elevated privileges, and the use of Powershell makes it highly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with high privileges suggest potential malicious activity for persistence.\",\n  \"file paths\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\mscoree.dll\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\Framework64\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\mscoreei.dll\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\Framework64\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\clr.dll\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\assembly\\\\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\\\\mscorlib\\\\316b66ba76e2cd70541b5fe8161637c9\\\\mscorlib.ni.dll\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\Framework64\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\clrjit.dll\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're worth investigating. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that raises an eyebrow. The first few events show Image Load and File Create\/Delete actions related to temporary files. Creating and then deleting a script file could indicate some kind of script execution or testing.\n\nLooking closer, there are two instances where powershell.exe is called with command lines. One creates a scheduled task named \"estrutura_auxiliar\" that runs calc.exe at logon as an Administrator with highest privileges. The other creates a task named \"unidade_comum\". Scheduling tasks to run calc.exe isn't inherently malicious, but using Administrator-level access and non-standard naming might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, the frequency here is notable. However, without more context on what specifically was changed, it's hard to assess if this is恶意行为。\n\nThe latter part of the logs has numerous \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process or file information. This could indicate remote execution attempts, which are often signs of potential attacks like remote code execution or command injection.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, and repeated remote command executions suggests a possible attack vector. While some activities might be legitimate, the overall pattern—especially the use of Administrator-level scheduled tasks and remote commands—is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including Powershell command execution creating malicious scheduled tasks,registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and numerous remote command executions. These indicators collectively suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to cybersecurity, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each log entry one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows `WmiPrvSE.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`. I remember that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and is usually legitimate, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\n2. Next, there are multiple entries of `svchost.exe` setting registry values. Svchost is a common process for services in Windows, but sometimes it's used by malware. However, without more context, these could just be normal service operations.\n\n3. Then, another entry from `svchost.exe` creating a file at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum`. The path looks standard, so maybe it's part of system updates or task scheduling.\n\n4. There are two events where the process is `None`, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds concerning because if there's no associated process, it might indicate some kind of remote attack or unauthorized access. I should note this as potentially suspicious.\n\n5. Powershell.exe creating files and setting registry values comes next. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for scripting and execution. Creating files like `entrada_principal.txt` could be part of malicious activities, such as storing scripts or configuration data. This definitely raises a red flag.\n\n6. Conhost.exe modifying the registry—Conhost is typically related to console services. While it's legitimate, any unusual activity here might warrant attention, but I'm not sure if this is normal or not.\n\n7. Chrome.exe events dominate the logs. It's loading various DLLs and setting registry values multiple times. This could be part of normal browser operations, especially since some of these are system-related files like `amsi.dll` which is related to antivirus scanning. However, the repeated registry writes might indicate something malicious trying to maintain persistence.\n\n8. Winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files—Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool for log management. Its activity doesn't seem suspicious here.\n\n9. Another remote command execution event with no process. This reinforces the earlier concern about possible unauthorized access or remote commands.\n\n10. More Powershell.exe file creation events, again pointing towards potential script execution or data storage for malicious purposes.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are a few red flags:\n- Multiple remote command executions without associated processes.\n- Powershell being used to create files, which could be scripts or configuration files for attacks.\n- Chrome making many registry changes, possibly indicating malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if some of these actions are normal. For example, svchost.exe is common but might sometimes be abused. The repeated registry writes by chrome.exe and the use of Powershell to create files stand out as concerning. Additionally, the remote command executions with no process context seem particularly suspicious.\n\nI think this batch should be classified as interesting because there are several events that together could indicate malicious behavior, especially involving Powershell and multiple remote commands.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities, including remote command executions without associated processes, Powershell creating files possibly for malicious scripts, and unusual registry modifications by Chrome.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
