{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has some process info, a Windows log task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of web activity, so these could be regular browsing activities. But then there's this switch to 'powershell.exe' events which catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer at the PowerShell processes, I see they have command lines that include downloading files from GitHub repositories. For example, one line has a command where it uses WebClient to download a file from \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_base\/objeto_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" into the TEMP directory. This is suspicious because downloading files directly via PowerShell without proper justification can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nMoreover, I notice that after downloading these files, there's a FileCreate event and then immediately a FileDeleteDetected event. That makes me think that maybe the file is being created but then deleted quickly, which could be an attempt to remove evidence or avoid detection. This behavior is often seen in malware where they drop files temporarily and then clean up after themselves.\n\nAlso, multiple instances of downloading different LICENSE.txt files from various repositories suggest that there might be a pattern here. It's unusual for legitimate scripts to download so many files, especially if the file paths being downloaded are changing each time with different repository names like 'modulo_temporario', 'unidade_base', etc. This could indicate that someone is trying to execute multiple scripts or modules in a loop, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother point is the use of the RegistryEvent tasks. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, allowing them to run at startup or maintain their presence on the system. Combining this with network activity and file operations makes it more concerning.\n\nThe events also show that the same PowerShell process is creating multiple files in the TEMP directory under different names. For example, '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1' and others. This might be an attempt to create malicious scripts on the fly or test script execution policies. If these scripts are being deleted right after creation, it's another red flag.\n\nI'm also thinking about the command lines in the process events. The way they're constructed with WebClient.DownloadFile is a common technique for downloading files without using more obvious methods like Invoke-WebRequest, which might be flagged by some security tools. Using WebClient can bypass certain detection mechanisms, making it a preferred method for attackers.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that there are multiple such download commands in different events suggests automation or a script that's looping through several URLs to download and execute files. This could be part of a payload delivery mechanism where each file is a component of an attack, or perhaps they're attempting to fetch different modules to execute later.\n\nPutting it all together: regular Chrome activity isn't concerning, but the PowerShell activities with multiple file downloads, registry modifications, and quick file deletions are indicators that something malicious might be happening. These actions could be part of an attempt to gain persistence, download malware components, or execute attacks without leaving traces. The repeated pattern in downloading files from GitHub repositories is also unusual and raises suspicions.\n\nSo yeah, I think this batch is definitely worth investigating further because the combination of these factors points towards potential malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:**\n   - Majority of events are from `chrome.exe`, which is normal for web browsing.\n   - Transition to `powershell.exe` processes is notable due to its dual-use nature.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Command Lines:**\n   - Commands use WebClient to download files from GitHub repositories, indicating possible external script execution.\n   - Examples include downloading `LICENSE.txt` into TEMP directories.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - File creation followed by deletion suggests attempts to hide traces of activity, a common tactic in malware.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Events show registry access, possibly for persistence mechanisms, which are often used by malicious software.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Multiple downloads from different repositories suggest automated or script-based activity, potentially indicating an attack campaign.\n\n6. **Conclusion on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - The combination of file downloading, registry changes, and file deletion is indicative of malicious behavior, suggesting the need for further investigation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags, including suspicious PowerShell activity, multiple file downloads from external repositories, and attempts to delete evidence. These actions are consistent with potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or payload delivery. Therefore, this batch is indeed interesting for cybersecurity investigation purposes. \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the batch contains indicators of potential malicious activity and requires further investigation.}}"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub repositories. The command lines show that they're using WebClient to download LICENSE.txt files into the TEMP directory under different names like estrutura_temporario.txt and estrutura_logico.txt. This is a bit concerning because downloading files from external sources can be part of malicious activities, especially if it's executed via PowerShell.\n\nThen, I notice several events where processes are creating files in the user's Downloads folder, such as elementpadrao.txt and others. These file creations happen after the downloads, which might indicate that the downloaded content is being saved locally.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value sets from Chrome.exe. While Chrome can modify the registry for extensions or settings, this many changes could be suspicious, possibly indicating a compromised extension or malicious activity modifying system configurations.\n\nAnother point is the repeated file creation events by winlogbeat.exe, which I think is related to log management tools. If it's creating configuration files, that might be normal, but the same path being written multiple times could suggest something is off, like a misconfiguration or potential log tampering.\n\nMpDefenderCoreService.exe shows a network connection. That service should handle antivirus tasks, so if it's making unexpected connections, it might indicate it's been compromised.\n\nLooking at all these events together: PowerShell downloading files, file creations in various directories, registry modifications from multiple processes—especially Chrome and others that aren't typically known for such activity—it raises red flags about potential malicious behavior. The repeated actions could be part of an attack chain, like download, execute, and persistence through registry changes.\n\nI'm also noting the use of different GitHub repositories as sources, which might not be inherently bad but could be a way to avoid detection by varying the sources or using legitimate-looking domains. This combination makes me think that these events together are indicative of an ongoing malicious process rather than isolated incidents.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because there's a pattern suggesting unauthorized activity, potentially indicating a breach or attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from external sources and creating files in various locations, combined with unusual registry modifications and network activities, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are common Windows processes. But then there are multiple events involving svchost.exe modifying the registry, which could be suspicious since svchost is often used by malware to hide activities.\n\nI notice Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll, which might not be unusual, but it's worth noting. Then there are several powershell.exe instances with process access and registry modifications. Powershell can be legitimate or malicious, so the context matters here. The command lines in some events like using SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\" could indicate an attempt to remove scheduled tasks, which might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also cmd.exe deleting registry entries related to Run keys and using REG DELETE on specific values. These actions are often used by malware to clean up traces or disable defender components. The use of multiple command-line tools like schtasks.exe, reg.exe, and cmd.exe with such commands suggests possible malicious activity.\n\nThe combination of these events—registry modifications, deleting tasks, and using common tools in a way that hides persistence—is concerning.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. There are several entries where PowerShell is being executed with an empty command line argument, which might indicate some automated or script-based activity. Notably, there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary PowerShell script, which could be a red flag for malicious behavior since attackers often use such techniques to remove traces of their activities.\n\nAdditionally, multiple registry value sets by PowerShell might suggest attempts to persistence or modify system configurations, which are common in malware activities. However, it's also possible that this is legitimate administrative activity, given the nature of PowerShell scripts used in system management.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate because while there are concerning signs like file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, they could also be part of normal operations, especially if the environment involves frequent script executions.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is about whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal because whoami is a common tool used for system information. Next, there's a PowerShell process accessed. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious, but on its own, it's not suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of cmd.exe and conhost.exe accessing the registry. Registry modifications alone aren't always bad, but repeated attempts might indicate something. Then I notice several instances where PowerShell is being used, including creating files and deleting them quickly. The file creation and deletion in a short time frame could be a sign of script execution testing permissions or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also see that some events show the command line as 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an attempt to execute commands without outputting anything. This kind of obfuscation might be trying to hide malicious activities, making it suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, which could indicate it's loading various modules or components. While normal for scripts, the frequency here raises concerns about potential exploitation.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a lot of process creations and registry modifications, which might be part of setting up persistence or lateral movement within a network. The repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious command lines is a red flag. This combination suggests possible malicious activities, making the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and registry modifications involving powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from Calculator.exe and chrome.exe creating pipes and setting registry values. That seems a bit odd because these are common applications; why would they be interacting with the registry like that? Maybe it's just normal behavior, but having several such events makes me wonder.\n\nThen there are quite a few powershell.exe processes. Powershell is often used for scripting but can also be a vector for malicious activities. The command lines in some of these entries look suspicious, especially the one where it's trying to remove a file from the TEMP directory. That could indicate an attempt to delete logs or evidence of something else running.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with powershell.exe, there are registry value sets and process accesses. These actions can be part of legitimate script execution, but they're also common in attacks to modify system configurations or gain persistence.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process which is used to check user information. It's usually harmless, but when combined with other scripts, it could be part of an attack to gather information about the system.\n\nThe image loads for various DLLs by powershell.exe might be normal if they're part of legitimate script execution. However, depending on the context and the files being loaded, some of these could be red flags.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination—especially multiple powershell instances performing file operations and registry modifications—could indicate malicious activity like a script trying to clean up traces or establish persistence. This makes the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications, and file operations that may indicate an attack attempt.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute scripts. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks for MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which seems normal since they're part of Microsoft's security tools. But then there are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for a temporary PowerShell script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. That's suspicious because creating and deleting files in the Temp directory might be an attempt to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks from chrome.exe loading AMSI and MpOAV.dll. Chrome accessing these DLLs is normal as part of its operations, so that doesn't seem too concerning on its own. However, combined with the powershell activity, it's worth noting.\n\nThen I see several command lines where powershell.exe is being used to delete files in the TEMP directory using Remove-Item. The paths like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc., don't ring any bells immediately, but deleting multiple temporary files could be part of an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activities. The fact that each deletion is done with -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the user wants to suppress error messages if the files aren't found.\n\nThere are also Process Create and Process Access events for whoami.exe. Whoami is often used to get system information, which can be part of reconnaissance or legitimate activity. But when combined with other powershell actions, it might indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the system.\n\nAdditionally, there's a Registry value set by conhost.exe. Conhost is associated with command-line tools like cmd.exe and PowerShell. Manipulating registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms for malware.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell processes are creating and deleting temporary files, accessing processes and registry keys, and deleting several files in the TEMP directory. These activities don't definitively prove malicious intent but do exhibit behaviors commonly associated with attack patterns. The repeated use of powershell.exe, file deletions to cover tracks, and system process interactions raise flags that this batch could indicate potentially malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are creating, deleting temporary files in the TEMP directory, and accessing registry values.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe being created with a command that tries to remove a file in the TEMP directory. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when it comes to deleting files which could be an attempt to cover tracks or delete evidence.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads various images. These might be normal operations since PowerShell uses the registry, but they could also indicate script execution or persistence mechanisms. The fact that some of these are repeated makes me think it's part of a larger script or process.\n\nLooking further, I see several FileCreate events for temporary files ending with .ps1, which suggests that PowerShell scripts might be executing them. This is concerning because scripts can execute malicious commands. However, in this case, one of the files is immediately deleted after being created. That deletion could mean an attempt to erase logs or evidence, which raises a red flag.\n\nThere are also Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events tied to powershell.exe. These might be part of normal script execution, but combined with other activities, they add to the suspicion. Additionally, there's a whoami.exe process creation, which is often used to check user privileges. If this is run in conjunction with other scripts, it could be part of privilege escalation.\n\nI notice that some events show powershell.exe accessing files like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are legitimate .NET framework components. But the way they're loaded might indicate script execution, especially if combined with the file creation\/deletion pattern.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management, so this might not be suspicious on its own. However, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use such tools to exfiltrate data or disrupt logging mechanisms.\n\nConhost.exe accessing the registry could indicate another process running with elevated privileges or attempting to create persistence points. This adds a layer of complexity to the overall activity, making it harder to pinpoint the exact nature of the events.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell.exe instances creating and deleting files, accessing the registry, loading images, and interacting with various system components. The repeated attempts to delete temporary files could indicate an attempt to remove logs or evidence of malicious activities. The use of whoami.exe might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile some activities might seem normal for a user running scripts or tools, the combination here raises concerns about potential malicious behavior. The recurring themes around powershell.exe and file operations in TEMP directories are particularly telling.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to delete temporary files, which could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\n2. **Registry Access and Image Loading**: Several events show registry access and image loading, potentially indicating script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Temporary Script Files**: Creation and immediate deletion of `.ps1` scripts suggest possible malicious activities, such as executing harmful commands and then erasing evidence.\n\n4. **whoami.exe Execution**: This tool's use could be part of privilege escalation tactics during an attack.\n\n5. **File Operations with winlogbeat.exe**: While `winlogbeat.exe` is typically benign, its activity here adds complexity and could relate to log management or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Conhost.exe Registry Access**: Indicative of possible elevated privileges or persistence attempts.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities—especially the repeated file operations and PowerShell usage—is suspicious. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation into user activity and system integrity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm just starting to learn about cybersecurity and system logs, so bear with me.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, there are multiple entries, each a separate line. Each entry has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The goal is to analyze all of them together to decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLet's break down the events one by one:\n\n1. **Initial Events with chrome.exe**: There are several entries where the process name is 'chrome.exe' and the winlog task is 'Registry value set'. This seems normal because Chrome is a common browser, and it might access the registry for updates or settings. Not sure if this alone is suspicious.\n\n2. **RuntimeBroker.exe**: There's one event with 'RuntimeBroker.exe' accessing the registry. I know Runtime Broker is related to Windows User Account Control (UAC) and managing user sessions. Registry accesses by such processes are standard, so probably not an issue.\n\n3. **Powershell.exe Activity**: Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. There are multiple 'Process accessed' events for Powershell. This could be normal admin activity or potentially malicious since scripts can do various things. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might raise an eyebrow.\n\n4. **whoami.exe Runs**: Several entries show 'whoami.exe' being executed with its command line path correct. Whoami is a standard system tool used to display user information, often part of legitimate scripts or troubleshooting. However, repeated use could be monitoring or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n5. **File Creation by winlogbeat.exe**: This process created a .yml file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an agent for collecting Windows logs, so creating config files makes sense. No immediate red flags here.\n\n6. **File Created by Powershell**: One event shows Powershell creating a text file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. The filename translates to something like \"active package\" or similar. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but it's also common for malware to create files with such names as part of payload deployment.\n\nNow, considering all these together:\n\n- **Powershell and whoami.exe**: Both are tools that can be used maliciously. The repeated access to Powershell might indicate scripting or lateral movement.\n- **File Creation by Powershell**: Creating a file could be for storing data exfiltration or as part of a malicious script's payload.\n- **Registry Access**: While normal, the multiple accesses in combination with other events might hint at something more.\n\nHowever, all these actions alone aren't conclusive. For instance, legitimate scripts could cause similar log entries. There's no clear evidence of unauthorized access or data breaches here. The lack of failed login attempts, unusual network traffic, or encryption activities makes it less suspicious.\n\nBut the volume and types of events—especially multiple Powershell accesses and file creations—are still notable enough to be worth a closer look by an analyst.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, whoami.exe being run, and file creation activities which could indicate potential malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
