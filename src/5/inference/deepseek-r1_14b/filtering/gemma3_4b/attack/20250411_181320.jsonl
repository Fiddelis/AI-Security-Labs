{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and a DNS query. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser that makes lots of network requests and DNS lookups. So those probably aren't suspicious on their own.\n\nThen I see several powershell.exe processes being created and accessing various registry keys. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. The command lines show commands like \"ls -recurse\" which list files recursively. That's not inherently bad, but when combined with other actions, it might indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is setting registry values and loading various DLLs. This activity could be part of legitimate scripting, but it's also a technique used by attackers to maintain persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nI notice that PowerShell creates a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1) which is then deleted shortly after. The creation and deletion of such files can be part of script execution, but it's also a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. Additionally, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with specific command lines might indicate an attempt to execute code in a way that's not straightforward, possibly evading certain monitoring tools.\n\nThe use of multiple registry access and process creation events could be part of establishing persistence or altering system settings for malicious purposes. Also, the file operations (create and delete) on temporary files without clear justification could signal an attempt to hide traces of their activity.\n\nWhile some of these actions are common in normal PowerShell usage, the combination—multiple process creations, registry modifications, network activities, and file handling—is concerning. These behaviors collectively might suggest a potential malicious script or process trying to stay under the radar.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because sometimes scripts perform many operations for legitimate reasons, but given the context of repeated suspicious events, it's reasonable to flag this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities including process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and network connections. These actions could indicate malicious behavior such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's being called multiple times could be suspicious. Also, I notice some events where powershell.exe is executing commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem', which are common directory listing commands but when chained together with other commands, they might indicate a broader script or potentially malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file paths, one event shows that powershell.exe created a file named 'objeto_principal.txt'. The path is under the user's Downloads folder. That doesn't immediately ring alarm bells, but combined with other actions, it could be part of data exfiltration or writing malicious scripts. Also, there are multiple instances where Registry values are being set. This is concerning because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nThere are several entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process but can be used by malware to hide their activities. Multiple events from the same process with the same task might indicate repeated attempts, which could be part of an attack vector trying different methods to persist or execute code.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and monitoring, but if it's behaving abnormally, like creating new configuration files repeatedly, that might indicate tampering or misuse.\n\nThe logs also include several 'User Account Management' events without a process name, which could be signs of credential-related activities or attempts to modify user accounts. This is another red flag because attackers often target user accounts to gain access or elevate privileges.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. While these processes are generally benign, any unexpected registry modifications should raise suspicion as they might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's clear that there's a lot of activity involving system-level changes—registry edits, file creations, process access, and repeated powershell executions. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate an ongoing malicious campaign aimed at persistence, data collection, or system compromise.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of multiple potentially suspicious actions across different processes raises concerns about a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe command execution, file creation, registry modifications by svchost.exe and other processes, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are four events here. Let me go through each one.\n\nThe first event is the process calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's interesting because I know that calc.exe is often used in malicious activities to execute code. But wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, so maybe it's not suspicious on its own. The second and third events involve svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common process, but unusual activity could be a red flag. However, the file path here is None, which might mean it's just registry changes without file access.\n\nThe fourth event repeats the same as the first one: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. This repetition could indicate something fishy because attackers often use legitimate processes multiple times for malicious tasks.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm thinking there's a pattern here with repeated process executions and file loads. While individually these actions might not be suspicious, their combination suggests possible malicious behavior, like persistence mechanisms or payload execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated instances of calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which could indicate potential malicious activity.
