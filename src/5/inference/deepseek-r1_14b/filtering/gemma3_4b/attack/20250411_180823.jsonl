Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser and would typically make such connections. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are events from RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe accessing the registry or processes. Again, these could be part of legitimate operations. For example, PowerShell might be used for scripting tasks, but I need to check if the commands are malicious.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that's a red flag. Malware often tries to hide by using legitimate tools like Calculator and DLLs. The use of schtasks.exe with cmd.exe commands also catches my eye. Task scheduler entries are common for persistence, so seeing multiple task creations might indicate an attempt to run malicious code on startup or logon.\n\nThere are several instances where svchost.exe is modifying the registry and creating files in the Tasks directory. Since svchost.exe is a legitimate process but can be used by malware, these activities could be part of malicious scripting. The repeated file creations with different names might suggest multiple payloads or components being dropped.\n\nThe cmd.exe commands are setting up tasks that execute calc.exe on startup or logon. This points towards persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts up.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe) creating scheduled tasks with malicious payloads (running calc.exe), combined with svchost.exe's registry and file modifications, suggests a potential malware infection using known tools for persistence. This batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as scheduled task creations (schtasks.exe) with commands to execute calc.exe, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with process info, Windows log details, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that several processes are involved: svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and whoami.exe. The tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Pipe Created, File created, Image loaded, etc.\n\nHmm, I remember that svchost.exe is a common system process, usually not malicious on its own. Same with ApplicationFrameHost.exe—it's part of the Windows shell. Calculator.exe being involved seems odd but maybe it's just a legitimate use. Powershell and chrome.exe are more concerning because they can be used for malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Registry value set is common in many processes, especially during configuration changes. Process accessed could indicate some form of inter-process communication or monitoring. Pipe Created might be related to IPC but without context, it's hard to say. File created events with specific paths like .winlogbeat.yml.new seem benign—probably from the ELK stack for logging.\n\nThe Image loaded tasks point to system DLLs which are normal, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries. The whoami.exe execution is interesting because it's often used by scripts to gather information about the current user, which can be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nPowershell being involved multiple times with different file creations and process accesses stands out. Malware often uses powershell for its capabilities, like downloading files or executing commands. The creation of unidade_ativo.txt might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other events, it could raise a flag.\n\nAlso, the repeated Registry value sets by chrome.exe seem excessive. While Chrome can make registry changes during updates or configuration, such high frequency might indicate some form of persistence mechanism being set up, possibly by malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple instances of powershell and chrome.exe performing actions that could be part of a broader attack. The combination of file creation with potentially suspicious names, process access patterns, and registry modifications suggests possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of powershell.exe and chrome.exe performing actions that could indicate malicious behavior, such as Registry modifications and file creation. Additionally, the use of whoami.exe adds to potential reconnaissance activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
