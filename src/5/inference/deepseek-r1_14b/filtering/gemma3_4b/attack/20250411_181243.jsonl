Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe being accessed and created. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, but it can be red flag when there are unusual activities. For example, some events mention \"Process Create\" with the command line containing various commands like net user, get-localuser, etc. These commands could be part of legitimate admin tasks, but they might also be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nLooking deeper, there's an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. This seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection, like dropping malicious scripts temporarily. The fact that it's using a PowerShell script policy test (as per the filename) might indicate some attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if they're effective.\n\nAlso, there are several Registry value sets by powershell.exe. Modifying registry entries can change system configurations, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior maliciously.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks with the same command line. This repetition might suggest a script running multiple times or in a loop, which could be indicative of automated malicious activity trying different things or attempting to stay undetected.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of potentially malicious activities involving PowerShell: creating processes, modifying the registry, accessing files and deleting them quickly. These actions don't seem to fit typical user behavior and could be signs of an attack. However, without more context or indicators of compromise (like known malware signatures), it's hard to be certain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions could be legitimate, but the combination is concerning enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes accessing system information, modifying registry entries, and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity or privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. First, I notice multiple entries related to `powershell.exe` being executed with command lines that include various system commands like `net user`, `get-localgroupmember`, and `cmdkey.exe \/list`. These commands can be used to gather information about users and groups, which might indicate reconnaissance activity.\n\nThere are also repeated instances of processes being created for `net.exe` and `net1.exe`, specifically with command lines that interact with user accounts and security groups. This could be part of an attempt to modify or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files by `powershell.exe`, such as `elemento_logico.txt`. The naming seems suspicious, possibly a cover for malicious activities or exfiltration attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry write events from both `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware survives reboots, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of system enumeration, privilege escalation attempts, and potential persistence setup. These activities are red flags for possible malicious behavior, making the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious commands, including user information gathering and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate JSON object. There are 13 events here. \n\nLooking at the first event: process name is RuntimeBroker.exe, task is Registry value set. I know that RuntimeBroker is related to Windows User Account Control (UAC) and it's not unusual for it to access the registry.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is involved in a RegistryEvent. PowerShell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so any activity here needs careful consideration. But without more context, it might just be legitimate use.\n\nThen there are multiple events with powershell.exe accessing processes (ProcessAccess). That's a bit concerning because attackers often abuse PowerShell for lateral movement or to execute commands. However, sometimes it's also used by scripts or tools during normal operations.\n\nThe fourth event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup, so this is probably legitimate log shipping activity. No red flags here.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing registry – not too unusual, maybe saving some settings or configuration.\n\nAnother ProcessAccess by powershell.exe. This repetition makes me think there's more to it; multiple accesses could be part of a script or malicious activity trying to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds normal since urlmon is a standard Windows DLL for URL handling. No issues here.\n\nThen, svchost.exe setting registry values twice. Svchost is another common process that's often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, two instances of RegistryEvent might not be enough to raise the alarm unless there's more context.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again – same as calc.exe, seems normal.\n\nAnother ProcessAccess by powershell.exe. This is the fourth time I've seen this, which makes me wonder if it's part of a larger script or suspicious activity.\n\nWhoami.exe being run from the system32 directory with a command line. Whoami is a basic info tool; seeing it might indicate someone checking user information, but without more context, it could be benign.\n\nAnd another ProcessAccess by powershell.exe – this is the fifth time, which might be significant if these accesses are part of an attack chain.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe events with ProcessAccess. Powershell is a high-risk tool for attackers because it's so versatile and can execute commands directly. Repeated ProcessAccess could indicate that it's being used to access other processes' memory, which is often a sign of malicious activity like process injection or credential dumping.\n\nAdditionally, the use of RegistryEvents by powershell.exe could be setting up persistence mechanisms in the Windows registry. Attackers often create registry keys to ensure their malware runs at system startup.\n\nThe fact that all these events happened within a short time frame and involve multiple instances of powershell accessing different processes is concerning. It's possible that this is part of an attack chain where the attacker is trying to gain deeper access into the system, possibly moving laterally or elevating privileges.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this could be legitimate activity. For example, a sysadmin might run a script that accesses multiple registry keys and processes using powershell. But given the number of events and their nature, it's more likely suspicious.\n\nSo, overall, the combination of repeated powershell.exe ProcessAccess tasks and RegistryEvent modifications suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and registry values suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
