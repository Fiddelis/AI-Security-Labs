{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the batch of events provided is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few events from different processes. The first one is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal because it's probably related to log shipping or monitoring. Then, mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE setting registry values. These seem routine too since they're system utilities accessing the registry for configuration.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries from powershell.exe. The command line shows that PowerShell is being executed with specific parameters, including -ExecutionPolicy Bypass. That catches my attention because using Bypass can allow scripts to run without the usual restrictions, which might be a red flag. Also, there's a file being created and then deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. Creating test files could be part of script execution checks.\n\nLooking at the ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, it's loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and others from different paths. That seems a bit broad but not necessarily malicious on its own. However, the fact that multiple images are being loaded might indicate some activity beyond normal use.\n\nThere are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from PowerShell, which could be related to module or provider initialization within the shell. Again, this isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe FileDeleteDetected event where the test file is deleted raises an eyebrow. Why would a script create and then delete a file? It might be trying to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. Also, the Pipe Created event could be for communication between processes or modules within PowerShell, which isn't unusual but can sometimes be used maliciously.\n\nLastly, there's a Process Create event where PowerShell is executing a script (teste.ps1) with Bypass execution policy. This combination—using Bypass and creating\/deleting files—could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code without user consent or logging, which is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows extensive PowerShell activity, especially using potentially dangerous parameters and file operations that could indicate script execution or lateral movement. While some of these actions are normal, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events from powershell.exe with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass and file creation\/deletion activities, which may indicate potential malicious script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from the user. They’re all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The goal here is to analyze the entire batch together and decide if it's interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe accessed something, according to the ProcessAccess rule. Not too alarming on its own because PowerShell is a common tool, but I should keep an eye out for other events related to it.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad tasks from powershell.exe loading different DLL files like mscoree.dll and others under the Microsoft.NET and Windows directories. This seems normal since PowerShell often loads these components when running scripts. However, I'm noticing they're all 64-bit framework files. That might be something to consider—whether it's expected in this context.\n\nThen, there's an event where powershell.exe loaded MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. Defender is known for using such DLLs, so that doesn't seem suspicious at first glance. But again, I need to see if this is part of a larger pattern.\n\nMoving on, I see two FileCreate events by powershell.exe: one creating a .ps1 script in the Temp folder and another creating a StartupProfileData file under Microsoft's Windows PowerShell directory. The creation of a .ps1 script could be a red flag because it's often used for executing scripts which might be malicious. But sometimes, legitimate processes do create temporary files too.\n\nImmediately after creating that .ps1 script, there's a FileDeleteDetected event for the same file. That's interesting. Why would a process create and then delete a file quickly? It could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of something malicious. Maybe it was testing if certain operations are allowed or trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother FileCreate event follows, this time in the StartupProfileData directory, which is more about PowerShell profiles for non-interactive sessions. Not sure if that's significant yet.\n\nThere's a Registry value set by powershell.exe as well. The registry is often used by malware for persistence or configuration changes, but without knowing exactly what was changed, it's hard to say. It could be part of legitimate operations too, especially if the script is setting some runtime parameters.\n\nLastly, there's an event where \"Execute a Remote Command\" is logged, but it doesn't specify which process or user. This could mean that PowerShell executed a command over the network, possibly fetching something or executing code from a remote source, which is definitely suspicious.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system files and DLLs, creating and deleting temporary scripts quickly, making registry changes, and executing a remote command. These behaviors collectively raise red flags. The rapid creation and deletion of the script file might be an attempt to avoid detection, and executing a remote command without clear justification could indicate malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities are within the normal behavior for this system or user. If powershell.exe is frequently used here, some of these actions might not be unusual, but the combination—especially the script creation\/deletion and remote execution—seems concerning.\n\nSo, based on all these points, I would classify this batch as interesting because it exhibits several behaviors that could indicate malicious activity, even if individually they aren't all suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows powershell.exe accessing system files, creating\/deleting a script quickly, making registry changes, and executing a remote command—indicators of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
