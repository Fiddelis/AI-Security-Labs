{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe showing network connections and DNS queries. That's normal for a browser, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values catches my eye. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful. Accessing the registry could be part of malicious activity.\n\nThere are several instances where cmd.exe is used with command lines that create scheduled tasks (schtasks). The commands point to calc.exe, which seems odd. Typically, you wouldn't use calc.exe in such a context. This might indicate an attempt to run malicious scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, schtasks.exe creating new tasks with specific names and cmd.exe commands is concerning. Scheduled tasks can be used for persistence or to execute malicious code at startup or logon.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying the registry multiple times is another red flag. svchost is a legitimate process but often exploited by malware. Unusual registry activity could indicate installation of backdoors or other malicious configurations.\n\nThe repeated use of file creation events with specific paths under Tasks might be setting up persistence points in the system, which is typical for malware trying to survive reboots.\n\nConsidering all these together—PowerShell access, cmd.exe creating malicious tasks, svchost registry modifications—it looks like a coordinated attack. These activities could be part of an attempt to gain persistence, escalate privileges, or deploy additional payloads.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell process access, cmd.exe commands creating malicious scheduled tasks, and svchost.exe registry modifications indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event and see what they all have in common or if there are any unusual patterns.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from 'chrome.exe'. Specifically, most of the entries show tasks like \"Registry value set\" and \"Image loaded\". Registry modifications can sometimes be a red flag because attackers often try to hide their presence by altering system configurations. But then again, legitimate applications also access the registry regularly.\n\nLooking closer, there are several instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values repeatedly. This could be normal operation, but it's worth checking what exactly those registry keys are being set for. If they're accessing known malicious paths or if the number of changes seems excessive, that might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThen there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this might just be part of its normal operation when setting up configuration files. However, the path mentioned (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\...) makes me think that maybe this is related to some user activity, perhaps downloading logs or other data.\n\nNext, there's a file creation by 'powershell.exe' for a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt'. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used in scripting, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. The filename seems benign, but without knowing the content, it's hard to say. It could be part of legitimate script execution or something more nefarious like data exfiltration.\n\nAnother event shows 'whoami.exe' being executed with a command line argument that just runs whoami in system32, which is standard for identifying the current user. This alone isn't suspicious, but when combined with other events, it might be part of an attacker's footprinting phase to gather system information.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch has multiple processes accessing the registry (chrome.exe), creating files (winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe), and a legitimate process like whoami.exe. The repeated registry writes by chrome.exe could be concerning if they're modifying known malicious keys, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, considering that there are multiple instances of RegistryEvent from chrome.exe, which is not typically associated with such high levels of registry activity unless it's part of a malicious payload. Also, the file created by powershell.exe might be storing sensitive information or scripts, and 'whoami.exe' being executed could be part of an attacker's method to gather user info.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events are normal, others like excessive registry writes and file creation by potentially malicious processes (powershell) do raise flags. This combination makes the batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized configuration changes. Additionally, powershell.exe creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' may suggest script execution for unknown purposes, and the use of whoami.exe might be part of user information gathering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
