{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line has three parts: process info, winlog task, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems normal because browsers do interact with the registry for settings. But then there are several powershell.exe processes. Powershell is commonly used by admins but also by attackers, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking closer at one powershell.exe event, the command line runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which logs keystrokes to key.log. That sounds malicious because it's designed to capture user input, which can steal credentials.\n\nThere are multiple instances where different paths are used for running Get-Keystrokes scripts. This suggests that the attacker is trying different locations to execute the same script, possibly evading detection by using various file paths.\n\nAlso, some powershell.exe events show files being created and then deleted, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. Temporary script creation followed by deletion can be a tactic to avoid detection, as it doesn't leave a footprint for long but still executes malicious code.\n\nThe use of multiple process creations and registry modifications by powershell.exe further indicates potential malicious activity. Legitimate scripts might not need such extensive interaction with system components in this manner.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated powershell.exe executions with known malicious script names and temporary file handling point towards possible APT or malicious activity aiming to capture keystrokes and maintain persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) designed to capture keystrokes, along with suspicious file creation and deletion patterns indicative of evasive tactics.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that multiple entries involve powershell.exe. In particular, two events have command lines pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. This script name sounds suspicious because it implies it's capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic for keyloggers used in malware to steal sensitive information.\n\nAlso, there are several registry value sets and file creations by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. The paths mentioned, like C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1, seem unusual and not standard system files. These could be indicators of malicious scripts being executed.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated file creations in different user directories, such as AppData and Downloads. This might suggest that the script is trying to write logs or other data across multiple locations, which isn't typical for normal user activities.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. While this could be legitimate if it's part of log management software, combined with the powershell activity, it raises questions about whether this is part of malicious behavior or data exfiltration.\n\nI don't see any direct evidence of malware propagation or clear signs like network connections to external domains, but the repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious script paths and activities that aren't standard user behavior could indicate a potential threat. The confidence level isn't very high because there's no smoking gun, but the combination is concerning enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe executing scripts with names suggesting keylogging activities (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), as well as suspicious file creations and registry modifications, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
