Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows whoami.exe being executed. That's a common tool for users to check their permissions and shouldn't be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple PowerShell executions. The command lines look like they're searching for files containing the word 'pass' with specific file extensions. This could indicate someone is trying to find password information, which raises a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, I notice several events where temporary PowerShell scripts are created and then deleted. Creating and immediately deleting files might be an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic in malware or malicious activities.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity related to loading various DLLs by PowerShell. This kind of behavior can be indicative of command-line abuse, possibly trying to execute malicious code.\n\nLooking further, there are repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same PowerShell command line. Repeating the same process multiple times might suggest scripting or automated behavior, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThe use of different file paths and registry accesses by these processes is another point of concern. Malicious actors often interact with system components to hide their presence or enhance privileges.\n\nLastly, there's a Notepad.exe accessing the registry, which seems unusual for such an application and might indicate unauthorized changes or attempts to modify system settings.\n\nConsidering all these events together, especially the repeated suspicious PowerShell commands and file deletions, it seems like this batch is highly indicative of potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice multiple entries from processes like svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, findstr.exe, OfficeClickToRun.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Each of these has specific tasks associated with them as per the winlog field.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common process in Windows, often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, without more context, this alone isn't suspicious.\n\nThe second event is Calculator.exe loading an image. That seems normal since Calculator is a standard app and would load necessary DLLs like urlmon.dll.\n\nThird, findstr.exe is being executed with a command line that searches for \"pass\" in various file types. The use of \/si indicates case-sensitive search, which might be looking for sensitive information or keywords. This could be concerning as it might indicate data harvesting or malicious activity.\n\nNext, OfficeClickToRun.exe querying DNS. That's normal if the user is interacting with an Office application that requires online services, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe event with a command line that seems to search for \"password\" using findstr and select-string cmdlets. This is definitely suspicious because PowerShell is often used in scripting and can execute malicious commands. The combination of searching for sensitive terms like \"password\" could be part of credential harvesting or exfiltration.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files, setting registry values, and being accessed. These actions in themselves aren't necessarily bad, but the frequency and context (like the previous findstr command) raise flags.\n\nThe events with conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and Calculator.exe setting registry values don't immediately stand out as malicious unless there's an unusual pattern or volume of such activities.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries involving DNS queries, image loads, network connections, and registry modifications. While Chrome is a common browser and these actions are standard for its operation, the number of registry changes could be suspicious if they're not part of normal browsing behavior. Malware often injects into legitimate processes like Chrome to hide its activities.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems related to log management, which might be part of an ELK stack or similar setup. Unless there's evidence it's being misused, this isn't particularly concerning on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes several red flags. The findstr and powershell commands searching for sensitive terms are concerning. Additionally, the repeated use of powershell.exe and chrome.exe with potentially malicious activities could indicate a larger issue, such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. However, without additional context (like timestamps, user activity, etc.), it's hard to be certain. The volume of events and specific command-line arguments suggest possible malicious behavior, but not conclusive proof.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the combination of searching for sensitive terms using legitimate tools, along with the use of powershell.exe which is commonly exploited by attackers, suggests potential malicious activity. While some events could be benign, others are too suspicious to ignore.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - Multiple processes (svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, findstr.exe, etc.) perform standard operations, but specific actions raise suspicions.\n   - Powershell.exe is used with commands searching for sensitive terms like \"password,\" a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\n2. **Identified Red Flags:**\n   - Use of `findstr` and `powershell` to search for sensitive keywords suggests data harvesting.\n   - Frequent registry modifications by powershell.exe and chrome.exe could indicate persistence mechanisms or malware injection.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The batch exhibits concerning patterns, particularly the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes and suspicious command-line arguments.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is classified as **interesting** due to potential malicious activities indicated by suspicious commands and tool usage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"isInteresting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The log events include potentially suspicious activities such as searching for sensitive terms using findstr.exe and powershell.exe, which may indicate data harvesting or malicious behavior. The repeated use of these tools could suggest an attack vector.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nThe first event is Powershell.exe creating a file called \"objeto_logico.txt\". Powershell can be malicious, but sometimes it's just normal use. Then there are multiple Chrome.exe events setting registry valuesâ€”this could be standard operation, maybe extensions or settings changing.\n\nI see several instances where schtasks.exe is used with commands to delete scheduled tasks. That might indicate someone trying to remove persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag. Also, the use of 'cmd.exe' with a command to delete notepad.exe processes stands out. Using wmic to delete processes is another potentially malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent accesses and changes, especially by svchost.exe and cmd.exe. These could be signs of malware attempting to modify system configurations or hide its presence. Additionally, the whoami.exe process running might be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nPutting it all together: Powershell and schtasks deletions suggest an attacker trying to remove traces of their activity or clean up after themselves. The command-line deletions using cmd and wmic are concerning as they show efforts to terminate processes or remove files, possibly covering tracks. The registry modifications by svchost could be part of creating backdoors or altering system settings for persistence.\n\nSo, there's a combination of activities that point towards potential malicious behavior, even though some events alone might seem benign. The pattern over multiple events increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially suspicious activities such as Powershell.exe creating files and registry changes, schtasks.exe deleting scheduled tasks, cmd.exe executing commands to delete processes, and whoami.exe running. These actions could indicate malicious behavior or attempts to modify system configurations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first three events all involve \"WMIC.exe\" loading different DLL files like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. WMIC is known to sometimes be used in malicious activities because it can execute commands remotely. The fact that it's loading system DLLs could be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities might raise a flag.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries of processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, net.exe, and net1.exe being executed with command lines that involve deleting users. For example, \"cmd.exe \/c net user \/del\" suggests that the system is trying to delete a user account. The usernames have patterns like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\", which seems unusual and possibly crafted to look legitimate but might be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several \"Registry value set\" events and \"Process Create\" events. These could indicate that something is modifying system settings or creating new processes, which is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. However, the combination with user deletions and WMIC usage makes me more cautious.\n\nPowershell.exe being accessed multiple times without a clear benign reason is concerning because it's often used for scripting and can execute arbitrary commands. The fact that it's accessing processes and registry values could be part of an attempt to elevate privileges or hide traces.\n\nThe repeated use of different executables (cmd, conhost, whoami) with similar patterns of deleting users might indicate a script trying multiple methods to ensure the deletion is successful, possibly evading detection by using various tools.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several red flags: WMIC loading DLLs, multiple attempts to delete user accounts using different executables, and powershell accessing system resources. These activities could be part of an attack where an adversary is trying to clean up traces or escalate privileges. While each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the combination suggests a potential malicious campaign.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitively malicious, but the pattern definitely stands out as concerning. There's enough evidence here that would warrant further investigation to see if these actions are part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of WMIC.exe loading DLLs, and several processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) performing registry modifications and user deletions. These activities could indicate malicious behavior such as privilege escalation or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several instances where processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being created or accessed. For example, the first event shows cmd.exe running with a command line that deletes something related to \"win32times\". That might be suspicious because deleting services can sometimes indicate malicious activity trying to remove traces or disable security features.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process which is typically used to check user permissions. It's not inherently bad, but if it's being run in conjunction with other commands, it could be part of an attack vector. There are also multiple events where powershell.exe is accessed and interacts with the registry or loads images. Powershell can be a powerful tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated usage without clear context might raise flags.\n\nI notice that some processes are deleting files in specific directories, like cmd.exe deleting files in the Temp folder. This could indicate an attempt to clean up evidence of previous actions, which is often a sign of malicious behavior. Additionally, the repeated use of Registry value sets by various processes suggests potential tampering with system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or alter security settings.\n\nThe events also show powershell.exe being called with unusual command lines, such as '& {}'. This might be an attempt to execute commands that are not easily visible, sometimes used in obfuscation techniques. Furthermore, the multiple instances of RegistryEvent and FileDeleteDetected tasks could indicate attempts to modify system behavior or remove files that shouldn't be deleted.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of process creation, file deletion, and registry modifications that don't appear to be normal user activity. These actions are common in attack chainsâ€”like initial access, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and impact.\n\nWhile some individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the combination of multiple such activities within a short timeframe is concerning. It's likely that an attacker is attempting to perform malicious actions on the system, possibly indicating a breach or ongoing attack.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events collectively, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to the potential signs of malicious activity and the combination of suspicious process creations, deletions, and registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creation, file deletion, and registry modifications indicative of potentially malicious activities such as attempting to remove system components, obfuscating commands, and accessing sensitive information. These actions collectively suggest a possible attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they're all related to PowerShell.exe. The tasks include image loading, file creation, deletion, and pipe creation. This makes me think someone might be running PowerShell scripts. Notably, there's a file created and then deleted: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1'. That seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script file could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or hide traces.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami is often used to check user privileges, so repeated executions might be part of reconnaissance activities. Also, the use of notepad.exe and calc.exe with image loads could be innocent, but considering the context of other suspicious activities, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. That seems normal unless there's something unusual about its content or execution path, which isn't evident here.\n\nThere are several 'ProcessAccess' events for powershell.exe and whoami.exe, indicating that other processes might be accessing them. This could relate to process injection techniques or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: creating\/deleting PowerShell scripts, repeated use of whoami.exe, and process access events. These indicators suggest possible unauthorized access, script execution, or post-exploitation activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of suspicious activity including the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file, repeated use of whoami.exe, and numerous process access events related to powershell.exe. These indicators suggest potential malicious behavior such as script execution or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three entries where the process is svchost.exe and the task is a Registry value set. Svchost.exe is known for being part of Windows services, but it can also be used by malware because it's a legitimate process. However, these events only mention registry changes without any other suspicious activity. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nNext, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management and might be part of the system's setup or monitoring tools. Since it's saving its configuration file, that seems normal unless there's something unusual about the path or permissions, but nothing stands out here.\n\nThen, there are two events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution. However, without seeing actual commands or exfiltration attempts, these could just be legitimate administrative tasks or part of automated scripts.\n\nAn event shows whoami.exe being run with the system32 path. Whoami is a common tool to check user information. Since it's executed correctly and doesn't show any unusual flags or paths, this isn't concerning on its own.\n\nThe rest are from chrome.exe: multiple DNS queries and network connections. Chrome is a browser, so these activities align with typical user behavior when browsing the web. They don't indicate anything malicious unless they're accessing known malicious domains, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together: While some processes like svchost, powershell, and whoami can be used for malicious purposes, there's no evidence in this batch of actual malicious activity. Each event seems to fit normal user behavior or legitimate system operations. There are multiple events, but without signs of anomalies or combined suspicious activities, the overall batch doesn't raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, I classify this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence because there's no clear indication of malicious intent across the events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as registry changes by svchost.exe, legitimate file operations by winlogbeat.exe, and routine network and DNS activity from chrome.exe. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or anomalies in the provided events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
