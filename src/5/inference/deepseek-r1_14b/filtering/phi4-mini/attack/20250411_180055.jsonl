{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is a ProcessAccess task from powershell.exe. That's normal since PowerShell is often used, but it might be worth noting the frequency later. The next event is whoami.exe being created. Not too concerning on its own, as it's a common system tool.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe again. I'm noticing that powershell.exe is appearing quite a few times here. Then there's a Registry value set task in one of the events. That could be suspicious because modifying the registry can indicate malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, several events show Compress-Archive commands in the command line arguments. This catches my attention because using compression tools in scripts is often part of data exfiltration or to hide malicious payloads. The paths being compressed vary, but they all point to different locations on the system.\n\nI see that some events have FileCreate and then immediately a FileDeleteDetected task for a PowerShell script file. That's interesting because it could mean the script was executed and then cleaned up quickly, possibly to avoid detection. The file name __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1 looks temporary, which aligns with that idea.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is called with similar Compress-Archive commands, each targeting different directories. This repetition suggests automated or script-based activity, possibly part of a larger process or an attempt to compress multiple files across the system. The fact that each command uses $env:TEMP for the destination might mean they're all being saved to the same temporary folder, which could be used later.\n\nThe tasks vary between ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, ImageLoad, File operations, and some Provider or Engine Lifecycle events. These are all typical for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with the other indicators, it raises suspicion.\n\nI'm also noting that multiple instances involve creating pipes (Pipe Created) and loading various DLLs, which could be part of normal operation, but in combination with the other activities might indicate something more nefarious like privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThe high frequency of powershell.exe invocations is concerning. While it's a legitimate tool, attackers often abuse it for command execution and persistence. The repeated Compress-Archive commands suggest data manipulation, which could be part of an exfiltration attempt or to package malicious tools.\n\nPutting this all together, the pattern shows signs of potential malicious activity: repeated use of PowerShell with scripting, registry modifications, file compression\/deletion, and temporary files. These indicators collectively make the batch interesting for a cybersecurity investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity, making it worthy of further investigation:\n\n1. **Multiple Powershell.exe Instances**: The frequent use of powershell.exe is notable, as attackers often abuse this tool for command execution and persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: A Registry value set task suggests possible attempts to establish persistence mechanisms, a common tactic in malware.\n\n3. **Compress-Archive Commands**: Several events show the use of Compress-Archive with varying directories. This could indicate data exfiltration or hiding malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Temporary Script File Creation and Deletion**: The creation and immediate deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file suggest an attempt to avoid detection, typical in malware activities.\n\n5. **File Operations and DLL Loadings**: While some operations are normal, combined with other indicators, they could signal privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of these factors—repeated Powershell use, registry changes, file compression, temporary files, and various system events—points to potential malicious activity deserving of a detailed cybersecurity investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. So, I've got 20 JSONL entries here, each representing different processes and their associated logs.\n\nStarting with the first few events, I notice that there are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is being executed. The command lines show commands like `Compress-Archive`, which suggests they're compressing files into ZIP archives. That's interesting because while PowerShell is a common tool, certain commands can be red flags for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer at the `process` field, several entries have command lines that point to specific paths on the system. For example, one of them has `-Path \"C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\elemento_secundario\\componente_principal\\bin\\modules_temporario\"`. The path seems a bit long and uses non-English naming conventions, which might be unusual depending on the system's locale. Also, using `$env:TEMP` as the destination for the ZIP file could indicate an attempt to stay under the radar or to avoid raising suspicion by placing files in temporary directories.\n\nThe `winlog` field shows tasks like 'Pipeline Execution Details' and 'Executing Pipeline', which align with PowerShell operations but don't immediately raise red flags. However, combined with the compression commands, it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nAnother point of interest is that some events involve `Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`. Modifying registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure they run at system startup or to hide their presence. If multiple processes are making changes to the registry, especially in quick succession, it could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nLooking through all the events, I also notice that `powershell.exe` is being accessed and interacted with several times, which could indicate repeated attempts to execute scripts. Additionally, there's an entry from `winlogbeat.exe`, which is likely related to log management. This might not be suspicious on its own but could be part of the attackers' efforts to clean up logs or cover their tracks.\n\nThere are also entries for other processes like `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `svchost.exe` modifying registry values, which is a bit concerning because these are typically legitimate system processes. If they're making unexpected changes, it could indicate that they're being exploited or part of a larger attack vector.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the volume of events involving `Registry value set`. There are several instances from different processes, and while some might be normal, the sheer number could suggest an unusual level of activity. Malware often uses registry modifications for persistence and to ensure it remains undetected.\n\nThe presence of `urlmon.dll` being loaded by both `calc.exe` and `chrome.exe` is interesting too. While `urlmon.dll` is a legitimate Windows component, its use in combination with other activities could be part of an exploit or a way to execute code under the guise of normal operations.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the pattern of repeated PowerShell usage, registry modifications across multiple processes, and non-standard command paths raises concern. These could be indicators of malicious activity such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or attempts to modify system configurations to facilitate further attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Commands:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands like `Compress-Archive`. This is notable for potential malicious scripting.\n   \n2. **Analyze Command Paths:**\n   - The paths in the `-Path` parameter are complex, using non-English directory names which might be unusual depending on the system's locale.\n   \n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Several processes, including `powershell.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, are modifying registry values. This activity could indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes.\n   \n4. **Frequency of Registry Changes:**\n   - The number of registry modification events is higher than typical system operations, suggesting possible malicious activity.\n   \n5. **Legitimate Processes Used Unusually:**\n   - `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `svchost.exe`, which are usually benign, show unexpected behavior by modifying the registry.\n   \n6. **Suspicious File Operations:**\n   - The use of `$env:TEMP` for storing compressed files could be an attempt to avoid detection or to clean up traces later.\n\n7. **Malware Indicators:**\n   - Combining these observations points towards potential malware activity, such as script execution, persistence, and system configuration changes to facilitate further attacks.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of logs shows several red flags indicative of possible malicious activity, including repeated use of PowerShell for compression, registry modifications by multiple processes, and the use of non-standard command paths. These patterns suggest a high likelihood of investigation being necessary to ensure system integrity and security. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Investigation is warranted due to suspicious activities involving PowerShell commands, registry modifications, and potential malware indicators.}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of two JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst event: It's a process named whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to the usual system32 directory. The Windows log task is Process Create under the rule ProcessCreate. That seems normal because whoami is commonly used to check user information, often by legitimate users or scripts.\n\nSecond event: Powershell.exe accessed, again via a ProcessAccess rule. Powershell can be both good and bad. While it's widely used for system administration, it's also a favorite tool for attackers due to its scripting capabilities. However, just seeing it access without any additional indicators like unusual command lines or file accesses might not be enough on its own.\n\nNow, considering both together: whoami is harmless, powershell access alone isn't suspicious unless there's more context, like malicious scripts. But in this batch, there are no signs of exploitation or unauthorized actions. The events don't show any attempts to download files, execute code, or interact with restricted areas. They seem routine.\n\nSo, I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because neither event indicates malicious activity when looked at together. There's nothing unusual enough to warrant an investigation based solely on these logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activities with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
