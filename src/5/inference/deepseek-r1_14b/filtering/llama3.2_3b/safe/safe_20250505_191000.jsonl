This is normal since Excel loads several system files when it runs. The files like combase.dll and mscoree.dll are standard Windows components, so their loading isn't suspicious.\n\nThere are a couple of events where EXCEL.EXE creates a file in the Recent folder: \"real_values.csv.LNK\". Shortcuts or recent files being created is typical user activity, especially when working with documents. This doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nI also see some registry value changes and special logon events, which are common during system operations and user logins. These aren't unusual and don't indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThe DNS query from EXCEL.EXE could be for updates or checking online resources, which is normal depending on what Excel is trying to do. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious, but there's no clear sign of an attack here.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, all these events seem to align with typical user activities and legitimate system operations. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses, process behavior outside the norm, or signs of unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal user activity such as launching Excel, loading standard system files, creating shortcuts, and legitimate registry operations.
