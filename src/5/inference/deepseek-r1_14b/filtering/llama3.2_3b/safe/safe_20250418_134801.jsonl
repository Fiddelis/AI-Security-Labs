I'm trying to figure out if there's anything interesting or concerning here that might require investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries related to file creation and deletion. For example, there are multiple instances where files are being created by processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and MpCmdRun.exe. Edge updates are pretty standard, so that doesn't immediately raise a red flag. However, the fact that a file was deleted in one event might be worth noting if it's unexpected.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are entries for Special Logon, User Account Management, Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. These cover a range of system activities, which isn't unusual on its own. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated loading of taskschd.dll by processes like taskhostw.exe and CompatTelRunner.exe. I'm wondering if this could be part of normal operation or something more sinister. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler, so frequent image loads might just indicate scheduled tasks running.\n\nAnother point is the process named winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory structure. That seems like it's part of the log collection setup and probably not malicious.\n\nI also see git.exe creating several files in a node_modules directory. This looks like normal development activity, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThe MpCmdRun.exe creating temporary lock files might be related to Windows Defender activities, which are legitimate.\n\nHowever, considering all these events together, I'm trying to see if any of them correlate or form a pattern that suggests malicious behavior. The fact that multiple EdgeUpdate-related processes are involved in file operations could indicate updates being installed or managed, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is unusual.\n\nThere's no indication of failed logon attempts, strange registry modifications beyond the value set, or any signs of privilege escalation. The user account management tasks might just be system-level activities like group policy updates.\n\nIn summary, while each event individually could look concerning in isolation, when viewed as a whole, they seem to fall within normal operational boundaries. There's no clear evidence of malicious activity across the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including updates, file operations, and legitimate processes.\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"Each event appears to be part of standard system operations without indicators of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst off, all these logs have the same structure. Each line is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git, a version control system. The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that files are being created. \n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to various JavaScript files within the node_modules directory of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Specifically, these files belong to the semver package. Semver is short for semantic versioning, which is used to manage software versions in a structured way.\n\nI'm noticing that each log entry corresponds to different parts of the semver package: functions, internal modules, and configuration files like package.json. This seems pretty normal when a developer is working on or initializing a project with Node.js, especially if they're using Git. The creation of these files could be part of cloning a repository, installing dependencies, or updating existing ones.\n\nNow, from a cybersecurity perspective, I don't see any red flags here. There's no indication of unusual access times, file paths that look suspicious (like executable files outside of expected locations), or multiple processes accessing the same files in an abnormal way. All activities are within the node_modules directory, which is standard for Node.js applications.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether git.exe is being used as part of a malicious activity. However, Git is a common tool among developers and isn't inherently malicious unless it's being used in a specific malicious script or process. Since all these events are about creating files related to semver, which is a legitimate package, there's no evidence of tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nI also think about the context of these logsâ€”this could be happening during development work, where multiple files are created as part of initializing dependencies. If I were monitoring for suspicious activities, this wouldn't raise any alarms because it fits typical user behavior in a software development environment.\n\nLastly, considering the confidence level: since all events are consistent with normal Git and Node.js operations related to package installation or updates, there's a high likelihood that these logs aren't indicative of malicious activity. The confidence is very high that this batch isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities related to the semver package in a Node.js project, which is typical during development or setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The process name is always \"git.exe,\" and all the files being created are located within the node_modules directory of a user's downloads folder.\n\nFirst, git.exe is commonly used for version control, so it's normal to see it creating files during a repository clone or install. The paths in the events look like they're part of a typical Node.js project setup, with various package.json and README.md files appearing. These are standard when installing dependencies using npm.\n\nI don't notice any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, hidden directories, or suspicious paths that might indicate an attack.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. All the entries are JSON objects with similar structures. Each event has a process name \"git.exe\", a task indicating that a file was created (FileCreate rule), and a specific file path.\n\nThe paths all seem to be under a user's Downloads folder, in a directory named after a course: \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". Inside there are node_modules folders with various package names like side-channel, signal-exit, slice-ansi, sshpk, etc. Each event corresponds to the creation of files within these modules, including LICENSEs, README.md, JavaScript files, and other supporting files.\n\nFirst thought: git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in Node.js projects since node_modules are standard in such environments. The events show multiple file creations under a project directory, which aligns with typical development activities.\n\nI should consider if these actions are unusual. Since all the processes are coming from git.exe and creating files in a structured manner under a user's project folder, it seems like this is part of a normal software development workflow. Perhaps the user is cloning or initializing a repository, installing dependencies, which would cause node_modules to be created.\n\nLooking for red flags: No evidence of access to unusual directories, creation of suspicious files (like executables outside expected paths), or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force. All file paths are within the project structure and consist of standard files you'd expect in a Node.js module.\n\nAnother angle: Could these events be part of an automated process or CI\/CD pipeline? It's possible, but without more context, it seems consistent with regular development activities.\n\nAre there any anomalies? Each event is similar, which could indicate bulk file creation, perhaps during an install or clone. But since they're all under node_modules and related to package files, this is expected when dependencies are being installed.\n\nPotential risk: If these actions were happening outside of expected hours or in a system without user interaction, it might raise suspicion. But with the given info, there's no indication of that.\n\nSo overall, I don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The batch appears to be normal operations related to software development using Node.js.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of a normal software development process involving file creation during the setup or installation of Node.js modules, which is expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, each has \"process\": {\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which suggests that Git is being used. The \"winlog\" field indicates that files were created (rule: FileCreate). The file paths point to locations within a directory called \"node_modules\", which is typical in Node.js projects for storing third-party modules.\n\nThe specific files being created are parts of the \"sshpk\" and other node_modules, like package.json, licenses, and JS files. This pattern continues across all eventsâ€”each shows Git creating files under node_modules, which is standard during a npm install or when cloning a repository that includes these dependencies.\n\nSince all activities are related to normal software development processes (installing or updating Node.js packages), there's no indication of any malicious behavior.

Each event is a JSON object representing some activity on the system.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are generated by the same process: \"git.exe\". This suggests that they're related to Git operations. The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that files were being created or modified.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all reside within a user's directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This looks like a typical location where someone might store project files. The specific subdirectories include \"node_modules\", which is common in Node.js projects, and files with extensions like .js, .d.ts, and .md, which are standard for JavaScript code, TypeScript definitions, and markdown documentation respectively.\n\nThe repeated occurrence of file creation events by Git suggests that this might be part of a repository's history being cloned or fetched. When you clone a repository, especially one with multiple dependencies like those in node_modules, Git creates all the necessary files and directories on your local machine. This is a normal part of using version control systems.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. All activities are consistent with typical user actions when working with a development environment, particularly with JavaScript and Node.js projects. There's no indication of file deletions, access to restricted areas, or other anomalies that might raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.

The process name in each case is \"git.exe\". The task under winlog is always the same: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file paths are all within the node_modules directory, specifically under tcomb\/lib.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. Git is a version control tool, often used in development environments. When you clone a repository or run certain git commands, it creates files and directories. Node.js modules, like tcomb, are commonly downloaded during the setup of a project. The creation of these files by git.exe might be part of the initial checkout process.\n\nEach event here is a file being created, which seems typical when setting up a new project or pulling changes from a repository. It's normal for Git to create files as it syncs data. Also, node_modules is where npm packages are stored, so creating these files is expected during installation or updates of dependencies.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file paths, no unexpected processes creating the files. All events follow a consistent pattern, which aligns with standard Git operations in a development context. There's also nothing indicating that an external tool or unauthorized process is accessing these files.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like normal behavior related to software development and package management.
