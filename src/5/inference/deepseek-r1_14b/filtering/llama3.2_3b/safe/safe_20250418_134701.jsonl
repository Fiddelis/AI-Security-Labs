Each one has the process name as git.exe, the task is \"File created\" with a rule named FileCreate, and the file paths are all within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project under lodash's fp namespace. \n\nI notice that there are 17 events here, each creating a different .d.ts file. The paths vary slightly but follow a consistent pattern. Since all these files are part of the node_modules directory, which is typically where third-party libraries and their type definitions reside, this seems normal for someone using tools like npm or yarn to manage dependencies.\n\nI'm wondering if git.exe being involved in creating these files is unusual. Git is often used for version control, so maybe a user is cloning a repository or pulling updates that include these files. Alternatively, it could be part of an automated process where the system is updating dependencies, which would involve writing new files to disk.\n\nI also check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The file paths don't seem suspicious; they're all within standard project directories. The filenames are typical for TypeScript type definitions, like overArgs.d.ts or partition.d.ts. There's no sign of hidden files or executable binaries being created, which might raise a red flag.\n\nConsidering the combination of all events, it seems consistent with normal development activities.
