I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each with process information, windows log tasks, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities. There are ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe, which means new instances are starting. Also, there are FileDeleteDetected events involving a PowerShell script in the user's Temp directory. That script might have been executed to perform some malicious tasks and then deleted to cover its tracks.\n\nLooking further, there are several Registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations for malicious purposes. Additionally, cmd.exe is being used with \"\/c\" command lines, which typically executes a command and then exits. This could be another attempt to run scripts or commands that might not be visible in the process list.\n\nI also see multiple FileCreate events related to PowerShell startup profiles and some file deletions. These activities are unusual for normal user operations and can indicate an attacker setting up persistence or executing malicious scripts.\n\nConsidering all these together, it's clear there's a lot of activity involving potentially dangerous tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with file and registry manipulations. This combination raises suspicion of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including powershell.exe usage, process creations, file deletions, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check the existence of various .bat files. The commands use Test-Path to see if these files exist, and exit accordingly. This could be part of a script checking for certain conditions on the system. However, it might also indicate malicious activity like trying to execute scripts from multiple locations.\n\nNext, there's an instance where whoami.exe is run. That's usually harmless but can be used to gather user information, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the file operations, powershell.exe creates a temporary .ps1 script and then deletes it shortly after. This behavior could be suspicious because creating and immediately deleting files might be an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry accesses from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While chrome making registry changes isn't unusual, frequent changes can be a sign of tampering. Powershell accessing the registry is common for legitimate scripting but could also be part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe events show repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines and file accesses, which might suggest a script running multiple checks or tasks. The deletion of temporary files and access to various system components could indicate either normal scripting behavior or something more nefarious, like a tool checking for specific vulnerabilities or deploying malware.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of repeated powershell.exe usage with varied command lines, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, and registry modifications across different processes raises concern. While individual events might not be alarming on their own, the pattern suggests potential malicious behavior that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with varied command lines checking file existence and creating\/deleting temporary files, along with registry modifications, indicate possible malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst up is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Windows services often do that. Next, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—wait, isn't that part of the system? Probably not suspicious. Then there's PowerShell accessing processes multiple times. Hmm, PowerShell can be used for good and bad things, but repeated accesses might warrant attention.\n\nI see svchost.exe setting registry values twice. Svchost is a legitimate process, so unless it's doing something unusual, maybe not an issue here. Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll—same as calc.exe, probably fine. Winlogbeat creating a file seems okay if that's part of its normal operation.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances where cmd.exe and powershell.exe are used with commands like deleting processes or files. For example, the command to delete notepad.exe might be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use such commands to cover their tracks. Then there's a command copying an exe file, which could replace system binaries—this is a red flag because it can indicate persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. While users with admin rights might do this, malicious actors often remove tasks to avoid detection. There's also the use of schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which could be normal but combined with other events might not be good.\n\nFinally, multiple ProcessAccess events in PowerShell and cmd.exe are notable because they indicate process injection or lateral movement if these processes are being used maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity involving legitimate tools like PowerShell, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe. However, the commands executed could be signs of an attack—deleting processes, replacing system files, removing tasks—all classic indicators of potential malware trying to hide or maintain persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities, such as process deletions and file copying that could be part of an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create new files and set content in .bat scripts. This could be malicious as PowerShell is often used for scripting attacks. The creation of these batch files might indicate an attempt to execute commands or alter system behavior.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, the combination with other events might raise a red flag. Malware sometimes loads multiple components to hide its activities or prepare for further actions.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event where powershell.exe is started again. Repetitive process creations of the same nature could be part of a loop or an attempt to run scripts multiple times, which isn't usual and might indicate automation or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, I see Provider Lifecycle events, which are less common in typical system operations. These could be related to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) activities or other services that might be manipulated by attackers.\n\nAdditionally, some command lines include conditional checks using Test-Path before exiting. This suggests an attempt to check if certain files exist before proceeding. If these files don't exist, the script might not do anything, but in this case, they are creating new files and setting content, which is concerning.\n\nConsidering all events together, it seems like a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain: using PowerShell to create malicious scripts, loading libraries for persistence or further attacks, and checking for file existence to potentially avoid detection. The repeated use of PowerShell with these specific commands increases the suspicion level.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting due to the combination of events indicating potential malicious activity. There's a high likelihood that an attacker is attempting unauthorized actions on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are creating new files and setting content in .bat scripts, which could indicate malicious script injection or file manipulation.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these are PowerShell executions. The command lines look similar; they check for the existence of certain .bat files and exit based on whether they exist or not. This pattern repeats across multiple events, which seems repetitive but maybe normal? But the paths in the Test-Path commands vary a bit each time.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, some tasks are 'Provider Lifecycle', others are 'Engine Lifecycle', and there's one each for 'File Create', 'Registry value set', etc. The repetition of these might indicate something is running multiple checks or maybe part of a script execution flow.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created in the Temp directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1 and another similar one that was later deleted. Creating and then deleting temporary files could be part of normal script execution to check permissions or something else, but it's worth noting.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these activities are within the baseline for a typical system. PowerShell is commonly used, so some activity is normal. However, the fact that there are multiple such events with varying file paths might indicate something more. Could this be part of an automated script checking for certain files across different directories?\n\nThe command lines also look like they're using escaped quotes and specific paths. This could be a legitimate process or maybe a malicious one trying to check if certain files exist as part of payload execution.\n\nI'm considering the confidence level here. While some events look suspicious, especially the file creation and deletion in Temp, there's not enough evidence yet to classify this as definitely malicious. It might just be a script running checks across different directories.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: multiple PowerShell executions with similar patterns, file operations in known temporary locations, but nothing overtly malicious like writing to restricted areas or unusual process trees. Therefore, I'd say it's INTERESTING but not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with varied file path checks and file operations in temporary directories suggest potential script execution activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what I've got here. There are a bunch of log events from different processes. Most of them involve powershell.exe and cmd.exe being executed with various command lines. Some tasks are Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, etc.\n\nLooking closer, the command lines in the PowerShell events have these if statements checking for file paths like C:\\something\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe or .cs files. It seems like they're testing whether certain files exist and exiting with 0 if they do, else 1. That's a bit unusual. Maybe they're trying to check if specific files are present on the system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is run. Using whoami without any arguments usually just returns the current user, but in combination with other events, it might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThe Image loaded events for powershell.exe point to various DLLs, which isn't too concerning on its own, but combined with the other activity could be part of malicious behavior.\n\nThere's a lot of PowerShell activity and command line executions that check for file existence. This kind of pattern is often used by attackers to verify if certain tools or configurations are present before executing more malicious actions. It might be part of a larger script or payload trying to ensure it has the necessary components in place.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a high volume of process creations and file checks, which could indicate reconnaissance or setup for an attack. The repeated use of PowerShell is a red flag because it's commonly used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct signs of malicious activity like known exploit code or obvious data exfiltration, but the behavior patterns are concerning enough that further investigation would be prudent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions checking for file existence and process creations involving whoami.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event and see what they're telling me.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement. But wait, in some cases, normal users might run PowerShell scripts too. Let me check the specific tasks associated with these instances.\n\nLooking at the events, there are file deletions and creations by PowerShell. Specifically, it created and then deleted a script called __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. That's an unusual filename, and creating\/deleting files can be part of hiding malicious activities. Also, the paths mentioned don't seem standard for legitimate scripts; they're in temp directories which are often used for temporary files that might get deleted.\n\nThen there's a command line argument in one event: \"& {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\\componente_padrao\\\\entrada_geral\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". That looks suspicious. It's checking if a specific PowerShell script exists and exiting based on that. Maybe it's trying to see if another malicious script is present, which could indicate an infection or attempting to spread.\n\nI also see multiple \"whoami.exe\" processes being created. While whoami itself isn't malicious, repeated executions might be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance. Plus, in some cases, attackers use legitimate tools like this for these purposes.\n\nThere's a notepad.exe accessing the registry and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Those don't immediately seem suspicious, but I know that sometimes even benign processes can have their behaviors altered by malware to carry out actions.\n\nAnother event involves svchost.exe connecting over the network. Svchost is usually part of legitimate services, but it's also commonly used by malware for communication. A network connection could mean data exfiltration or command and control activities.\n\nThere are several instances where processes like chrome.exe are making DNS queries and establishing network connections. While that's normal in some contexts, if these events coincide with other suspicious activity, it might indicate something more malicious, such as data being sent out or attempting to reach a command server.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activities. The repeated use of PowerShell with unusual file operations and script checks stands out. The network connections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe could be part of an attack chain. While some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination suggests a coordinated effort that merits closer investigation.\n\nI'm 85% confident because while each individual event could have benign explanations, the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further scrutiny.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell.exe, including file creation\/deletion, network connections, and unusual process behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial logs, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is involved. The first two events show file creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. That's a bit concerning because scripts created temporarily can be signs of malicious activity, especially if they're deleted afterward to cover tracks. \n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe checks for the existence of specific .ps1 files using Test-Path. The command lines all have similar structures, checking different paths like \"C:\\tarefa_padrao\\estrutura_auxiliar\\objeto_comum\\src\\\" and variations with \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This repeated check suggests that the script is trying to see if a malicious payload exists in various locations. If these files aren't present, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it might proceed to execute them.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. That could be used by attackers to determine the current user, which might be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. However, in this case, it's a standalone execution without any unusual paths, so it might not be too suspicious on its own but combined with the other events, it adds up.\n\nLooking at the file operations, there are instances where files are created and then deleted. This pattern is often seen in malware to avoid detection by leaving fewer traces. The repeated ImageLoad and ProcessAccess tasks indicate that PowerShell is accessing various system components, which can be normal but might also be part of malicious activities like loading libraries for exploit purposes.\n\nAnother thing I'm noticing is the multiple Provider Lifecycle events related to PowerShell. These could be related to script execution or module loading. If these are happening alongside file checks and deletions, it raises my suspicion that something malicious is being orchestrated through these scripts.\n\nPutting all this together, there's a pattern of PowerShell activities: creating temporary files, checking for specific script files, deleting those files, accessing other processes, and multiple provider lifecycles. These behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious intent, such as testing the presence of tools (maybe dropped by another process) or attempting to execute them.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this could be legitimate activity. For instance, system administrators might run PowerShell scripts for maintenance, but the repeated checks for specific files and temporary file creation\/deletion are red flags. Additionally, the use of multiple paths in different parts of the filesystem (like C:\\tarefa_padrao\\... or C:\\registro_secundario\\...) doesn't seem like standard administrative tasks. These look more like attempts to locate files across various directories, possibly indicating a broader search for something malicious.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are several indicators of potential compromise, it's not conclusive without seeing the actual content of those .ps1 files or further evidence of command execution beyond these checks and file deletions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation, deletion, and repeated checks for specific scripts suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

I'm seeing multiple events from powershell.exe, which is a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, each shows that powershell.exe loaded different system DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. That in itself isn't suspicious—PowerShell often interacts with these files during normal operation.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is running a command line script. The commands listed are ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These all seem to be variations of directory listing commands. While unusual, especially repeated multiple times, it's possible the user was running some scripts or automation.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created in the PowerShell profile directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This could be part of legitimate configuration, but it's worth noting as it indicates that powershell.exe was writing to user-specific directories.\n\nOne event stands out where a registry value was set by powershell.exe. This is more concerning because modifying the Windows Registry can be an indicator of malicious activity, like installing persistent malware or making system changes to maintain access.\n\nAdditionally, the log shows winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That's likely unrelated unless it's part of some unauthorized logging setup.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe with both normal and potentially suspicious activities, including registry modification.
