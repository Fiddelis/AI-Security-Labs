{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst up is a PowerShell process creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for attacks. Creating files in non-standard locations might indicate malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries where cmd.exe and svchost.exe are modifying registry values. Both of these processes can execute commands or access the registry, which could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms for malware. Registry modifications alone aren't always suspicious, but when combined with other activities, they raise flags.\n\nAnother event is Chrome loading a file from the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Chrome might load various DLLs, so I'm not too worried about that unless there's more context indicating malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, we have multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry entries, cmd.exe doing similar things, and svchost.exe touching a file in a network service profile. These activities together could be part of an attack chainâ€”using PowerShell for execution, registry modifications for persistence, and possibly other tools like cmd or svchost for lateral movement.\n\nThe presence of componente_principal.txt being created by powershell.exe stands out as it's a filename that doesn't immediately ring any bells but might be a new file dropped during an attack. The combination of these events makes me think there could be malicious activity, so the batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry entries, cmd.exe and svchost.exe also showing similar behavior, which may indicate potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or file creation for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events, there are several entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Network connection detected and Dns query. These seem normal because Chrome regularly connects to networks and performs DNS lookups. Nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nThen, I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times. The first few entries show process access and creation events. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so I need to be cautious. \n\nLooking closer, one of the powershell.exe processes has a command line that starts another process with a .bat file path: \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario..\". The use of \"..\" suggests directory traversal, which could indicate an attempt to access restricted directories or files. This is a red flag because it's often used in attacks to move laterally within the system.\n\nThere are several similar command lines with different .bat file paths. Each one starts a new process using powershell.exe and a bat file located in various directories. The pattern of multiple such processes starting could indicate an automated or script-based attack. This repetition is concerning because it might be part of a larger campaign trying to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads images like mscoree.dll and clr*.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, but their loading in conjunction with other suspicious activities could be part of obfuscation or loading malicious modules.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1\". Temporary script files created by Powershell might be legitimate, but without seeing the content, it's hard to say. The naming convention seems generic, which isn't unusual, but combined with other factors, it adds to the concern.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs. These relate to PowerShell's internal operations, but when paired with process creations and file writes, they might be part of a larger malicious script execution.\n\nFurthermore, there are registry value sets from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome might update its settings, repeated registry modifications by powershell could indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple Powershell instances starting different bat files with paths that use directory traversal, combined with image loading and file creation events, suggest potential malicious activity. The repetitive pattern of process creations points towards a script trying to execute multiple commands, possibly indicative of an attack.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, this batch of logs shows signs of suspicious behavior that could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating processes with potentially malicious command lines and directory traversal patterns, along with file creation events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
