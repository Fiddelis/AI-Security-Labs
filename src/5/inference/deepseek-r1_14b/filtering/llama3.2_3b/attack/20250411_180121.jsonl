The first two entries are from chrome.exe detecting network connections, which is normal for a browser. Then there's a PowerShell process creating a new instance and executing some commands.\n\nThe command lines in the PowerShell processes are using DownloadFile to fetch files from GitHub repositories. This could be malicious if those files contain harmful code, but it might also be legitimate script execution. The paths where these files are being saved seem temporary (e.g., %TEMP%), which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.\n\nI notice multiple similar events with different filenames and repository URLs. This repetition might indicate an automated process or a script that's downloading several components, possibly part of a larger payload delivery.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory, followed immediately by a FileDeleteDetected event. This could be an attempt to remove evidence, which raises suspicion. Additionally, there are Registry value set events from chrome.exe, but these seem unrelated to the malicious activities and might just be normal operation.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from various repositories, creating temporary files, deleting them, and no corresponding file creations in more permanent locations suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories to temporary paths, followed by deletion of the downloaded files.

Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. One stands out because it has a command line that tries to download something from a GitHub repository into the temp directory. That could be suspicious since downloading files from external sources can sometimes indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen, I notice several process creations and file operations. For example, cmd.exe is used with SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\". This might be an attempt to remove scheduled tasks, which is often part of persistence mechanisms in malware. Also, there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is run, which could be checking user permissions or gathering information.\n\nThere's also the creation of files and registry changes by various processes like svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. These are common system processes, but unusual activity from them might indicate something is off.\n\nI'm seeing several events where powershell.exe accesses different files or processes, which can be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities.\n\nTaking all these together—the downloading of an external file, deletion of scheduled tasks, multiple process creations with potentially harmful commands—it seems like there's a coordinated effort that might indicate malicious behavior.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Events show powershell.exe being run multiple times with different command lines and tasks like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image Load, etc. That could be normal admin activity, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there are temporary files created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. For example, a .ps1 script is being created. Temporary scripts can be risky if they're downloading or executing code from untrusted sources.\n\nThere's also an instance of cmd.exe with \"\/c\" which usually runs a command and exits. The exact command isn't clear here, but it could be used to execute other tools. Then there are processes like whoami.exe and conhost.exe mentioned, which are typically benign but can sometimes be part of more complex attacks.\n\nThe Registry value sets in various tasks might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag for potential malware activity.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions, creation of temporary scripts, use of command-line tools, and registry modifications suggests possible malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is commonly used in malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. The first few logs show tasks like Registry value set and Image loaded. These are normal operations, but when combined with other actions, they could indicate something suspicious.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Then, immediately after, that same file is deleted. This pattern seems unusual because why create and then delete a script? It could be an attempt to test permissions or remove evidence.\n\nAnother event catches my attention: a command line in powershell.exe that includes removing a .zip file from the TEMP directory. The command is Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip. This suggests that the script was trying to delete a specific file, which might be malicious if that file was created earlier or contains harmful code.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe accesses other processes and modifies registry values. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when paired with the file creation\/deletion and the removal of a .zip file, it starts to look like potential malware activity. Malicious scripts often clean up traces of their presence by deleting files or altering logs.\n\nThe events from chrome.exe and whoami.exe setting registry values are less concerning on their own, but considering the overall pattern, they might be part of a larger campaign or just noise in this specific case.\n\nTaking all these together—multiple powershell instances, file operations in Temp, deletion of a script, and process access—it's reasonable to classify this batch as INTERESTING. The confidence is high because several indicators point towards possible malicious activity, especially the PowerShell commands that manipulate files and processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations, including creating and deleting a script in the Temp directory, and accessing other processes.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, looking at the events provided, I see a lot of PowerShell activity. That's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and file operations.\n\nThe first event shows that a file was created in the temp directory by powershell.exe. Then, another event says that same file was deleted. This create-delete cycle is common when malware tries to remove evidence or test if certain actions are allowed.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where PowerShell is used with Remove-Item commands targeting files in %TEMP%. These deletions are happening across different filenames and paths, which suggests a script might be cleaning up traces. Such repeated deletions could indicate an attempt to erase logs or malicious files, making it suspicious.\n\nI also notice registry value sets by powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to stick around after reboots. This adds to the concern as it's a common tactic for attackers.\n\nThere are some events from chrome.exe loading DLLs. While this seems normal, it's worth noting because sometimes malicious scripts can inject code into legitimate processes, but in this case, I don't see any direct evidence of that happening here.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution is another point to consider. It might be used to gather system information or verify privileges, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at all these events together, the pattern shows extensive PowerShell activity with file deletions and registry modifications. This combination isn't typical for regular user activities; it looks more like something a malicious actor would do to maintain access or cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated file removals in the TEMP directory suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from `winlogbeat.exe` related to file creation. Specifically, it's creating a new YAML file in the data directory. That seems normal for winlogbeat since it might be setting up configuration files or logs. But I notice that this event appears twice at the beginning and towards the end of the log batch. Not sure if duplication is an issue here.\n\nNext, there are several entries from `powershell.exe`. The first one loads a DLL file related to Windows Defender. That's standard because PowerShell often loads system DLLs when running scripts or commands. Then there's a command line that tries to remove a file in the TEMP directory: `Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\estrutura_padrao.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore`. This could be suspicious because deleting files from TEMP might be part of malicious activities, but it's also common for legitimate scripts to clean up after themselves. I'll need to check if this file path is associated with any known threats.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events from both `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe`. While modifying the registry can indicate malicious activity, especially in bulk, it's also a normal operation for some applications, like Chrome tweaking its settings or extensions. However, seeing multiple registry changes by PowerShell might raise an eyebrow because attackers often use PowerShell for persistence.\n\nAnother event is from `whoami.exe`, which just reports user information. That seems benign unless used in conjunction with other activities to escalate privileges, but on its own, it's not a red flag.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though they're not provided here), if these events are happening within a short timeframe, that could be concerning as it might indicate a sequence of malicious actions. The repeated use of PowerShell accessing processes and files is notable. For example, multiple `ProcessAccess` tasks from PowerShell suggest it's interacting with other processes, which could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe file creations by PowerShell are also interesting. Creating a `.txt` file in the Downloads folder isn't inherently bad, but if these files are being used as part of a larger attack chain, like exfiltration or writing malicious scripts, it becomes suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, accessing processes and registry keys, deleting files, and creating new ones. This pattern could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for command execution and persistence. The combination of file deletions in TEMP and the creation of specific files elsewhere might be part of a script aiming to erase traces or drop malicious payloads.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because while some activities are normal, the volume and combination suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file deletion attempts, registry modifications, and process access may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
