Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event is whoami.exe running normally. Not a red flag. Then there are multiple powershell.exe processes. One has a command line with some findstr and select-string commands searching for passwords in various file types. That seems suspicious because it looks like it's trying to search for sensitive information, which could be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the events, powershell is accessing registry values and loading images. Some are normal DLLs, but the repeated RegistryEvent tasks might indicate persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts. There's also a file delete event for a temporary PowerShell script, which suggests that malicious scripts are being created and then deleted to cover tracks.\n\nThe pipe created event could be for communication between processes, possibly to hide activities. The provider and engine lifecycle events might be part of how the malware is initializing and managing its components. \n\nThere's an svchost.exe process modifying registry values, which is concerning because svchost is often used by malware to hide itself or create persistent entries.\n\nThe chrome.exe events with multiple Registry writes could indicate that another process (maybe a legitimate one) is interacting with Chrome settings, but seeing so many might be unusual and worth looking into, though less likely malicious compared to the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and file operations, along with registry modifications and attempts to delete temporary files, points towards potential malicious activity. The events indicate possible credential harvesting or persistence mechanisms, which are significant security concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, including searching for sensitive information and creating\/deleting temporary files, along with registry modifications that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from `winlogbeat.exe` creating files in the same path. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for logging, so it's expected behavior. \n\nNext, I see multiple events from `chrome.exe` related to registry changes and network connections. While Chrome can make such changes when updating or interacting with extensions, the number of RegistryEvent entries (four) might be worth noting, but not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there are PowerShell activities creating files named 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. The naming doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's important to check if these files contain anything malicious or if the process accessing them is part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe `whoami.exe` command line seems standard for user identification. However, in some cases, it might be used by malware to gather information, so I should keep that in mind.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe and schtasks.exe events, there are commands attempting to delete tasks using schtasks. Specifically, the command deletes two tasks related to \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Malicious actors sometimes use task scheduling to maintain persistence, so deleting such tasks could be an attempt to remove competition or hide their activities.\n\nThe `schtasks.exe` event loading taskschd.dll is normal for scheduled tasks. But when combined with the deletion of specific tasks earlier, it might indicate someone trying to modify system behavior in a way that's not typical user activity.\n\nThere are events from svchost.exe and conhost.exe modifying registry values. These processes are often used by legitimate software, but they can also be abused by malware for persistence or configuration changes. The frequency here is something to note.\n\nMultiple PowerShell process accesses without corresponding file operations could indicate reconnaissance or data gathering activities, which might be part of an attack chain.\n\nFinally, the WMIC.exe events with commands to delete notepad.exe processes and load various DLLs are concerning. Using wmic to delete processes can be a way to terminate legitimate tools like Notepad, possibly to prevent logging or analysis. Additionally, loading DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might be attempts to bypass antivirus or perform malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of process creations, registry modifications, file deletions via schtasks and WMIC, along with multiple PowerShell accesses, suggests potential malicious activity. The use of administrative tools like schtasks and WMIC for deleting processes and tasks is a common tactic in attacks to maintain persistence or disrupt system defenses. While some events might be benign, the overall pattern leans towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The log contains multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as process deletions using schtasks.exe and WMIC.exe, registry modifications, and file accesses by PowerShell. These activities could indicate unauthorized system manipulation or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"FILE_PATH\": \"\/var\/log\/secure.log\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events and trying to determine if they're worth investigating. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several instances where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that access processes or modify the registry. Powershell can be a red flag because it's commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities like scripting attacks.\n\nThere are events where users are deleting network accounts using net.exe, cmd.exe, and net1.exe. These commands are often used in command-line operations but repeated deletions of user accounts might indicate an attacker trying to remove traces or disable accounts as part of lateral movement.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is appearing multiple times. While this is a standard tool for checking user information, its repetitive use could be suspicious if it's not tied to any legitimate activity, possibly indicating credential gathering or reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are many events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various commands. This combination of frequent process creations, registry modifications, account deletions, and potential lateral movement indicators is concerning. These activities don't seem typical for normal user behavior and could be signs of a possible security incident or attack.\n\nI'm noticing that the justification needs to be concise but informative. The confidence level should reflect how certain I am about this classification based on the observed patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, and user account deletions suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first four entries all involve powershell.exe loading various DLL files. That could be normal because PowerShell often loads different libraries when running scripts or commands. But sometimes, certain DLLs might indicate malicious activity, but looking at the paths here, they seem to be standard .NET framework components, so that's probably okay.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set by powershell.exe and some Process Access events. These could be normal PowerShell operations, accessing existing processes or modifying registry settings. However, if these actions are out of the ordinary for typical usage, it might warrant closer look. But I don't see anything immediately suspicious here.\n\nThen, there are two entries about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an application used to collect and forward logs, so this seems benign unless it's being misused. The path looks like a standard location for the tool's data files, which doesn't raise red flags.\n\nMoving on, I see several instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is a common system command used to display user information, so this is usually not malicious. Unless it's part of an escalation or privilege check in an attack sequence, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are events where RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modify the registry. Runtime Broker is related to Windows User Account Control (UAC) and might be legitimate, while Notepad.exe accessing the registry could be for configuration purposes. Again, nothing overtly malicious here.\n\nsvchost.exe modifying the registry a couple of timesâ€”svchost is a common host process for various services, so some registry activity isn't unusual. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll also seems normal; it's a standard DLL used in URL handling.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe file creation repeats, which we've already considered as benign. Another Process Create event for whoami.exe again doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe. The former is part of the Windows shell, and Chrome's DNS queries and network connections are standard behavior, especially if it's accessing certain websites or resources.\n\nPutting all this together, most of these events are either normal system processes or activities related to legitimate software operations. While powershell.exe can be used maliciously, the specific actions here don't indicate any clear signs of an attack. The repeated Process Access and Registry modifications by PowerShell might be a bit concerning, but without more context or unusual timing, they could just be part of regular scripting.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually each event seems benign, and collectively there's no strong indication of malicious behavior. However, the confidence isn't too high because sometimes attackers can blend in with normal traffic, but in this case, I don't see enough evidence to suggest otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes and activities such as PowerShell loading standard libraries, registry modifications by common applications, and the creation of log files. There is no clear indication of malicious behavior or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
