Let me start by looking through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events where PowerShell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve Compress-Archive. That seems suspicious because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and compression tools can be used to package malicious files. The repeated use of Compress-Archive might indicate an attempt to create compressed archives, possibly to exfiltrate data or prepare for a payload.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading different DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell scripts but could also be part of malicious activities trying to hide their tracks by using legitimate modules. Also, there's a FileDeleteDetected event where a .ps1 file is being deleted. Deleting script files might be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent execution.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the use of various paths in the Compress-Archive commands. The different directories like \"unidade_temporario\", \"modulo_principal\", and others seem too varied, which could suggest they're trying to access multiple locations for data extraction or distribution.\n\nI also see a process involving winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file. That's unusual because it's a log shipping tool; having it create a configuration file might be legitimate but could also be part of setting up a logging system for malicious activities, or perhaps an attempt to change how logs are collected to hide tracks.\n\nThere's one event with calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. While calc is generally benign, the combination with urlmon could indicate something related to network activity or execution of code that shouldn't be there.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe setting a registry value might not be directly suspicious on its own since svchost can run many services. But combined with other events, it adds to the narrative of potential malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activity: repeated PowerShell usage for compression, file deletions, diverse directory accesses, and tooling that's unexpected in a standard environment. While some events might be normal, the combination suggests a higher risk.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activity involving PowerShell.exe, including Compress-Archive commands across various directories, deletion of script files, and unexpected use of log shipping tools. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst up is a process named Calculator.exe loading the ImageLoad rule. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application, so it's expected to load system DLLs like urlmon.dll. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent for collecting logs, so creating configuration files isn't unusual. The path looks legitimate too.\n\nThen there are multiple events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the registry. This is a common Windows process used for hosting application frames, and it's normal for it to interact with the registry without raising red flags.\n\nMoving on, chrome.exe has several RegistryEvent tasks. Browsers often write to the registry to store settings or preferences, so this activity is typical and not concerning on its own.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe was executed. Whoami is a standard command-line tool used to display user information. It's commonly used by both legitimate users and scripts, so without additional context, it doesn't seem malicious.\n\nLastly, powershell.exe was accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. However, in this case, there's no indication of any script execution or unusual activity; just the process being accessed.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these events indicate malicious behavior. They're all within normal operational parameters for typical user activities and system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system processes such as Calculator.exe loading DLLs, winlogbeat creating configuration files, ApplicationFrameHost accessing the registry, Chrome browser activity, legitimate use of whoami.exe, and PowerShell access without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
