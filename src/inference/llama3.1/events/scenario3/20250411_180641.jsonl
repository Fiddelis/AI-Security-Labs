{"file":"events\/scenario3\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"A Windows event log analysis!\n\nAfter analyzing the logs, I've extracted some interesting patterns and anomalies:\n\n**Top 5 Processes:**\n\n1. `chrome.exe` (24 occurrences)\n2. `powershell.exe` (7 occurrences)\n3. `svchost.exe` (4 occurrences)\n4. `winlogbeat.exe` (2 occurrences)\n5. `notepad.exe` (1 occurrence)\n\n**Registry Value Set Events:**\n\n* `chrome.exe` is consistently setting registry values across multiple events.\n* Other processes like `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` also set registry values, but less frequently.\n\n**File Creation Events:**\n\n* `winlogbeat.exe` creates two files with the `.new` extension in the `data` directory:\n\t+ `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`\n\t+ (another occurrence of this event)\n\n**Anomalies:**\n\n* The high frequency of registry value set events for `chrome.exe` might indicate a malicious extension or behavior.\n* The creation of files with the `.new` extension by `winlogbeat.exe` could be related to configuration or logging issues.\n\nKeep in mind that these findings are based on a manual analysis and might not cover all aspects of the event logs. A more comprehensive analysis would require specific knowledge of Windows event logs and potentially additional tools.\n\nIf you'd like me to dig deeper into any specific aspect, please let me know!"}
