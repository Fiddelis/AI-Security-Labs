However, it's essential to note that these files might still be malicious, even if they are being created by a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe).\n\nTo mitigate potential risks, I recommend:\n\n1.  Investigate the purpose and source of the SDXHelper.exe process.\n2.  Monitor file creation events for any further changes or anomalies.\n3.  Review the file contents and hash values to ensure they are not related to known malicious files.\n\nPlease consult with a cybersecurity expert for more detailed analysis and advice on handling this situation.\n\nHere's an example JSON output summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": \"LOW\",\n  \"summary\": \"Multiple identical file creation events detected.\",\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Investigate SDXHelper.exe process\",\n    \"Monitor file creation events for further changes or anomalies\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and actual output might vary based on the specific requirements of your environment."}
