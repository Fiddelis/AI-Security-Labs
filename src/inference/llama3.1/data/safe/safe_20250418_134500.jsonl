{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"A Windows event log in the JSON format!\n\nThis log appears to be from a Windows system, with events recorded by various processes and services, including Microsoft Edge Update, RuntimeBroker, PowerShell, and Winlogbeat.\n\nHere's a brief summary of the events:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update**:\n\t* Creates a process (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) with event ID 1000.\n\t* Loads images from its executable file (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe).\n\t* Accesses various files and registry keys, including C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\1.3.195.49\\msedgeupdate.dll.\n\t* Terminates with event ID 1058.\n2. **RuntimeBroker**:\n\t* Sets a registry value (event ID 1002).\n3. **Winlogbeat**:\n\t* Creates a process (winlogbeat.exe) with event ID 1000.\n\t* Loads the winlogbeat executable file from C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\winlogbeat.exe.\n\t* Creates a log file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson with event ID 1024.\n\nSome other events are present, but these seem to be related to system maintenance or normal operations:\n\n* Event ID 1002 (registry value set): This might indicate a configuration change.\n* Event ID 1058 (process terminated): Microsoft Edge Update process terminates normally.\n* Event ID 1024 (file created): Winlogbeat creates a log file.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on a quick scan of the events and may not cover all aspects or potential security concerns. A more in-depth review by a security expert would be necessary to identify any specific threats or issues."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from Winlogbeat, an open-source log collector for Windows systems. The log contains information about various system events, such as process creations, file operations, and registry modifications.\n\nHere's a brief analysis of the log:\n\n1. **Process creations**: Many processes are created, including Explorer.EXE, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, and setup.exe.\n2. **File operations**: Various files are created, deleted, or modified, including temporary files (e.g., `EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp`) and system files (e.g., `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl`).\n3. **Registry modifications**: The Explorer.EXE process performs a registry value set operation.\n4. **Dns queries**: The CompatTelRunner.exe process performs a DNS query.\n5. **Winlogbeat events**: Winlogbeat itself creates files (e.g., `.winlogbeat.yml.new`) and logs events.\n\nSome interesting observations:\n\n* There are multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe running, which might indicate an ongoing update or installation process.\n* The `setup.exe` file is created in the `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install` directory, suggesting that it's related to an Edge browser installation.\n* The registry value set operation by Explorer.EXE might be related to system configuration changes.\n\nTo further analyze this log, you could use a tool like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk to process and visualize the data."}
