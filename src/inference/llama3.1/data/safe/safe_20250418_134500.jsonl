{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log of Windows event data collected by Winlogbeat, an open-source Beats module that collects and forwards Windows event logs to Elasticsearch or other supported outputs.\n\nHere's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update**:\n\t* Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are launched.\n\t* The executable loads various DLLs (e.g., `msedgeupdate.dll`) from its directory.\n\t* The process accesses the executable and other files in its directory.\n\t* The process terminates, possibly due to a network connection being detected or an error occurring.\n2. **RuntimeBroker**:\n\t* A new instance of `RuntimeBroker.exe` is launched, which sets a registry value.\n3. **Winlogbeat**:\n\t* A new instance of `winlogbeat.exe` is launched from the downloads directory.\n\t* The executable loads itself and creates a log file in its own directory.\n4. **Powershell**:\n\t* An existing instance of `powershell.exe` accesses an unknown process ( possibly related to the Winlogbeat installation).\n5. **File creations**:\n\t* Multiple event logs are created by various processes, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe`.\n\nThese events suggest that there was a series of updates happening on the system, likely related to Microsoft Edge or other applications using Winlogbeat for logging. The presence of multiple instances of these executables might indicate ongoing maintenance or troubleshooting efforts.\n\nIf you have specific questions about these events or would like me to focus on particular aspects of this log data, please let me know!"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file from the Winlogbeat tool, which is used to collect and forward Windows Event Log data to an Elasticsearch server or other supported output. The log contains various events related to system activity on a Windows machine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some of the notable entries:\n\n1. **Process creation**:\n\t* Multiple processes are being created, including `notepad.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `setup.exe`. This indicates normal system activity.\n2. **File creation**:\n\t* Several files are being created, including `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl` (a Windows Update log file), `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` (a temporary file), and `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe` (an executable file).\n3. **Registry value set**:\n\t* A registry value is being modified, likely as part of the system configuration.\n4. **Dns query**:\n\t* The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process is performing a DNS query, which could be related to updates or other system activity.\n5. **File deletion logged**:\n\t* A file (`{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`) is being deleted, which might be a temporary file created during an update process.\n6. **File creation time changed**:\n\t* The creation time of the `setup.exe` file has been modified, possibly as part of the system configuration or update process.\n\nOverall, these events appear to be related to normal system activity, including updates and configuration changes. However, some of the entries may indicate potential security concerns, such as suspicious file creations or deletions."}
