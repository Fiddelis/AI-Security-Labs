Reviewing process lists to identify any unfamiliar or suspicious processes.\n2. Analyzing registry changes for signs of malware or unwanted software installation.\n3. Examining network traffic to determine if there are any unusual DNS queries or connections to unknown servers.\n4. Investigating temporary files and folders for potential malware activity.\n5. Scanning the system with an anti-virus program to identify and remove any malicious software.\n\nPlease note that these findings may not necessarily indicate a security breach, but rather suspicious activities that require further investigation."}
