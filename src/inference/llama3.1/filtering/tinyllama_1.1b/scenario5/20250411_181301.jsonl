This could be a sign of tampering with Windows Defender or other system components.\n\nThe classification of event 8 is interesting because a new file was created in the user's download directory by 'winlogbeat.exe', which might indicate some suspicious activity.\n\nThe classification of event 10 is interesting because a new file was created in the user's downloads directory by 'powershell.exe', which might indicate some suspicious activity."}
