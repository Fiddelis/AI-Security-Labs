{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario2\/20250411_180237.jsonl","analysis":"{\n    \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n    \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most log events are related to normal system processes such as tasklist, cmd, and winlogbeat executing their tasks. Some registry value set events could indicate malicious activity, but without additional context it's hard to say for certain.\"\n}\n \nHowever, there are a couple of interesting entries that might warrant further investigation:\n \n* {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\entrada_logico.txt'}\"} - This event indicates that a powershell process created a new file. This could be a legitimate operation, but it's worth checking the contents of this file to make sure it doesn't contain any malicious code.\n \n* {\"process\":\"{'name': 'tasklist.exe', 'command_line': 'tasklist'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"} - This event is interesting because tasklist.exe is not a standard Windows process. Tasklist is typically invoked via the cmd or powershell, so seeing it as its own separate executable could be indicative of some sort of malware attempting to blend in with normal system processes.\n \n* {\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"} - This is another example of a standard Windows process being executed as its own separate executable. Like the tasklist entry above, this could be indicative of malware attempting to disguise itself.\n \nThese events are still not conclusive indicators of malicious activity, but they do warrant further investigation. It would be worth reviewing the system logs around these times for any other suspicious activity."}
