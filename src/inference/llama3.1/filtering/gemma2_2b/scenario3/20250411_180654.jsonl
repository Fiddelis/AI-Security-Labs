{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"A log file!\n\nAfter analyzing the log, I've identified some interesting events. Here are my findings:\n\n**Malicious activity**\n\n1. A PowerShell script `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is being executed by various processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`) from different paths (`C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src`, `C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src`). This script is likely designed to collect keystrokes or other sensitive information.\n2. The same script is also being executed remotely (detected by the `None` process and `Execute a Remote Command` task).\n\n**Suspicious behavior**\n\n1. Various processes (`powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are creating files with names like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1` in the user's temporary directory.\n2. The same processes are also setting registry values, which may be indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**System changes**\n\n1. Files are being created or deleted in various directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_temporario.txt`).\n2. Registry values are being set, which may indicate changes to system settings or configuration.\n\n**Potential indicators of compromise**\n\n1. The presence of suspicious PowerShell scripts (`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`) and their execution by various processes.\n2. Unusual file creations or deletions in user directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`).\n3. Registry value changes, which may indicate malicious activity.\n\nTo investigate further, I recommend:\n\n1. Reviewing the system's event logs for any related entries.\n2. Analyzing the PowerShell scripts `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` to determine their purpose and behavior.\n3. Investigating the registry values that have been changed to understand their impact on the system.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level analysis, and further investigation may be necessary to fully understand the nature of the activity detected in the log file."}
