{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with network connection and DNS query tasks. While Chrome is a common application, repeated network connections might be suspicious, but on their own, they could just be regular browsing activity. \n\nThen I notice several events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The first few events show process access and registry modifications, which can be part of malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking closer at one event, the command line in powershell.exe has a Base64 encoded string that decrypts into a script attempting to XOR-encrypt some plaintext. This is concerning because it's obfuscating code to hide its true purpose. The script seems to be trying to send data over HTTP to an external domain (example.com), which could indicate exfiltration of sensitive information.\n\nAnother event shows the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1) in a short timeframe, which is a common tactic by attackers to execute malicious scripts without leaving long-term traces. This combined with the use of XOR encryption suggests an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\nThe events also include loading various .NET and Windows Defender files, which might be part of legitimate operations or attempts to masquerade as benign processes. However, when coupled with the other suspicious activities, it raises red flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, encrypting data for exfiltration, creating temporary files quickly, and using obfuscation techniques are strong indicators of possible adversary activity. These actions collectively suggest that this batch is not just routine but indicates a potential attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities, including network communication attempts and file operations indicative of malicious behavior such as encryption and data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with a specific command line. The command line seems to be encrypting some plaintext using a simple XOR cipher with a key. It then sends the ciphertext via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This looks suspicious because it's using PowerShell to execute code and send data over the network, which are common indicators of malicious activity.\n\nHowever, looking closer, I see that in each of these events, the 'winlog' field is either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks are typically related to Windows event logging setup and might not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. Additionally, there's a file path in one of the events pointing to MpClient.dll, which is part of Microsoft Defender, so that seems legitimate.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting Windows logs, so this activity is normal and expected if it's running as part of system monitoring.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with similar command lines could indicate either automated legitimate tasks or potential malicious activity. Since there's no additional context about the source or other indicators like unusual file accesses or network communications beyond the POST request, it's hard to be certain without more data. The fact that some events are related to log engine setup and others are normal process loads might mean this is part of a larger script or configuration process.\n\nTherefore, while there are elements that could warrant closer inspection—like the repeated use of powershell.exe for network operations—it doesn't seem conclusive enough on its own without further evidence. It's possible these activities are part of a legitimate script or setup process, especially if they're happening in an environment where such tools are commonly used.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some concerning elements, they don't provide enough information to confidently label this as malicious activity. More context and analysis would be needed to determine the nature of these events.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events does not conclusively indicate malicious activity but contains elements that require further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **Suspicious Activities**:\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing a script that encrypts data and sends it via HTTP POST to example.com. This behavior is concerning as it aligns with common tactics used in cyberattacks, such as data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Legitimate Activities**:\n   - Events involving `winlogbeat.exe` creating configuration files are normal for log collection tools.\n   - Loading of `urlmon.dll` by `powershell.exe` is standard and not indicative of malicious intent on its own.\n   - The event involving `MpClient.dll` is part of Microsoft Defender, indicating legitimate system operations.\n\n3. **Unclear Context**:\n   - The repeated use of `powershell.exe` could be either automated legitimate tasks or malicious activities. Without additional context such as unusual file accesses or network destinations beyond the observed POST request, it's challenging to determine intent.\n\n**Conclusion**: While there are elements that raise suspicion, particularly the network activity from `powershell.exe`, they do not provide sufficient evidence of malicious behavior without further analysis. It is recommended to monitor these activities for patterns or additional indicators and consider deeper investigation if possible."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key tells me which application is running, winlog gives me the type of log entry, and file sometimes provides a path or is None.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n\n1. powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when it comes to persistence mechanisms.\n2. Then there are multiple Registry value sets from various processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Registry changes can be part of setting up persistence or modifying system configurations, which might be malicious.\n3. There's also a DNS query event. While not inherently suspicious on its own, combined with other activities, it could indicate command-and-control communication.\n4. Processes like svchost.exe and Calculator.exe are showing up frequently. Svchost is commonly used by malware because it's a legitimate Windows process, making it harder to detect. Calculator.exe might seem benign, but if it's involved in malicious activities, that could be a red flag.\n\nI also notice repeated entries from chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome can interact with the registry for extensions or settings, multiple such events without an obvious reason might warrant closer look.\n  \nAnother point is that powershell.exe is accessing processes and interacting with files. This could be part of script execution or installing backdoors.\n\nLooking at the winlog types: Pipe Created, Registry value set, Image loaded, etc. The Image Loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are interesting because they relate to anti-malware scanning. Malicious code might try to load these to avoid detection or clean up after itself.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file. This is likely the log management tool itself, which shouldn't be suspicious unless it's behaving oddly.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of multiple Registry changes by different processes, especially from known utilities like PowerShell and svchost.exe, raises concerns. These could be part of persistence mechanisms or setting up a malicious environment. The repeated Registry writes from chrome.exe are also concerning. However, without additional context, such as timestamps or more detailed process information, it's hard to definitively say if these actions are malicious.\n\nI might look into whether the PowerShell activities correlate with known attack patterns, check for any unusual network traffic, and see if the Registry changes match those expected from legitimate software updates or user actions.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several characteristics that merit attention from a cybersecurity standpoint:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activities**: The creation of a file by powershell.exe in a non-standard directory could indicate potential malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple processes, including conhost.exe and svchost.exe, are making Registry changes. These could be part of setting up persistence or altering system configurations for nefarious purposes.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Writes by Chrome.exe**: The frequency of Registry value sets from chrome.exe might warrant further investigation to rule out malicious extensions or activities.\n\n4. **Anti-Malware DLLs Loaded**: Events involving amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll suggest potential attempts to evade detection or clean up after malicious actions, which could be red flags.\n\n5. **Legitimate Processes with Suspicious Behavior**: While processes like Calculator.exe are typically benign, their involvement in these logs could indicate misuse.\n\n**Conclusion**: The logs show signs of potentially suspicious activities, particularly the combination of Registry modifications and PowerShell usage. Further investigation is recommended to determine if these actions are part of an attack or legitimate system operations."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. Most of these involve processes like powershell.exe and chrome.exe, along with various tasks they're performing.\n\nFirst off, I notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times, which immediately raises some flags because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. The fact that there are several instances where it's being launched with specific command lines makes me curious. For example, one event shows a command line argument involving Remove-Item to delete files. That could be innocent admin work or part of malicious activity aiming to erase evidence.\n\nLooking deeper, there are file creation and deletion events. Powershell created a temporary .ps1 script and then immediately deleted it. This is suspicious because attackers might create and delete scripts quickly to avoid detection. Also, the paths in the command lines seem to target various locations like \"modulo_principal\" and \"registro_logico_script.bat\". These names aren't standard system files; they sound more like custom or malicious scripts.\n\nAnother point is the Registry value sets and Image loads from powershell.exe. While legitimate processes do interact with the registry, repeated writes can be a sign of tampering, especially if combined with other suspicious activities. The file paths loaded include .NET framework components, which isn't unusual, but when paired with other events, it adds to the concern.\n\nOn the other hand, chrome.exe is also seen making Registry changes multiple times. While this could be normal for browser updates or plugin installations, it's not as concerning unless there's a pattern of abuse.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file manipulations and script executions stands out. The combination of creating, executing, and deleting scripts quickly is a common tactic in attacks to stay under the radar. While some events could be legitimate admin tasks, the volume and specific actions lean towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands that delete files and creating\/deleting temporary script files suggest possible malicious activity or at least unusual behavior that warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's look at the events provided.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. Each entry shows `powershell.exe` being used with command lines that remove specific files. For example, commands like `Remove-Item` targeting `.bat` scripts in various paths. This could indicate script execution or file deletion activities, which might be malicious.\n\nNext, there are entries where other executables like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `sc.exe` are running with certain command lines. For instance, `cmd.exe` is used to stop and delete services (`objeto_temporario` and `estrutura_secundario`). These commands can be part of a service uninstallation or process termination, which might be legitimate but could also signal malicious activity if not expected.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry-related events. Processes like `services.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are modifying the registry. Registry changes can be benign, such as during software installations, but they can also be part of persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation attempts by malware.\n\nLooking at the frequency, the batch contains several similar events, especially multiple PowerShell executions with similar command structures. This repetition could suggest automated or script-based activity, possibly indicating an attempt to delete traces or establish persistence.\n\nThe use of `Remove-Item` in PowerShell without proper justification and combined with service deletions via `sc.exe` raises red flags. Such actions are often part of cleanup routines by malware after executing malicious scripts, trying to remove logs or evidence.\n\nMoreover, the events show a pattern: starting with file removals using PowerShell, followed by process creations and registry modifications. This sequence could be part of an attack chain where an adversary attempts to delete files, terminate services, and modify system configurations to maintain access or cover their tracks.\n\nWhile some events might not individually indicate malicious activity, the combination—especially the repeated use of PowerShell for file deletion, service termination via `sc.exe`, and registry modifications across multiple processes—suggests a potential security incident that warrants closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to delete files, combined with other suspicious activities like service termination and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a cmd.exe process deleting a file in the temp directory. That seems suspicious because it's a common tool used in malicious scripts to clean up traces. Next, powershell.exe is being accessed multiple times, which is concerning because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nThen, I see cmd.exe again modifying registry values. Registry changes can indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. There are several instances of this, so it's not just a one-time thing. Conhost.exe also modified the registry, which might be part of a hidden process.\n\nWhoami.exe was executed without any arguments. That could be used to check permissions or gather information about the current user, which is often a step in reconnaissance before an attack.\n\nPowershell.exe creates several files in the temp directory and then deletes them quickly. This behavior can be a sign of script execution trying to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces. The file paths look temporary, so it's suspicious they were created and deleted within the same session.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, which is normal but could also indicate that malicious scripts are being run. Additionally, there are several Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for PowerShell, suggesting script execution might be happening.\n\nLooking at all these together, it seems like there's a pattern of command-line tools (cmd, powershell) being used to delete files, modify the registry, create temporary files, and access system components. These actions could be part of an attack chain—reconnaissance, lateral movement, or cleanup.\n\nThe combination of file deletions, registry modifications, and PowerShell activity is red flags for potential malicious behavior. It's possible that this batch shows an active threat where an attacker is attempting to establish persistence or execute malicious scripts on the system.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of data exfiltration or clear exploit attempts here, but the sequence of events suggests a high level of suspicion. The confidence in this classification would be fairly high because multiple indicators point towards potentially malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including cmd.exe deleting files, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions with potential script execution and file deletions in the temp directory, indicating possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are a lot of powershell.exe processes being created. That's already a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. I should pay attention to how it's being used here.\n\nThe second event shows that powershell.exe loaded MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender might use PowerShell scripts. But then, in another event, powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That location isn't typical for most users, so I wonder why it's creating a file there.\n\nNext, there are several events where Registry values are being set by both powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure they restart after a system reboot.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe is being executed twice. While this command itself isn't malicious, it's often used by attackers to gather information about the current user or system, which could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThen there are events where cmd.exe deletes files in the TEMP directory and sets registry values again. Deleting files might be an attempt to remove evidence, but also, deleting specific files like modulo_base.exe suggests that something malicious was dropped there, and the attacker is cleaning up.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in some powershell.exe processes that tries to remove key.log from the TEMP directory with an error action ignored. This could mean they're trying to delete logs without causing any noticeable errors, possibly to cover their tracks.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file named tarefa_comum.txt in the Downloads folder. Creating files in user directories isn't inherently bad, but combined with all the other activity, it raises suspicion about potential data exfiltration or configuration changes.\n\nThroughout these events, there's a pattern of multiple process creations and deletions, registry modifications, and attempts to remove log files. These behaviors collectively point towards possible malicious activities like persistence, data collection, or system configuration changes that might be part of an attack chain.\n\nGiven all these signs—use of powershell.exe for potentially malicious commands, file creation in non-standard locations, registry edits, deletion of specific files, and covering tracks—I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING. The confidence level is high because the combination of events isn't typical user behavior and aligns with common attack tactics.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of powershell.exe processes, including command lines that attempt to remove files in the TEMP directory and create files in non-standard locations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, a lot of these events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The repeated occurrences suggest that something is going on with it.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Registry value set, Process Create, Process accessed. These are all typical Windows events, but when they happen in such a concentrated manner related to one process, it's suspicious.\n\nSpecifically, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing various files and registry entries. There's also a command line argument: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\". That looks like an attempt to delete a file in the TEMP directory named key.log without showing any error messages if it fails.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the creation and then deletion of temporary files, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1\". This might be part of some script testing or obfuscation. It's possible that this file was created as a test to see if certain policies are enforced, and it gets deleted afterward to avoid detection.\n\nThe repeated Registry value sets and Process accesses could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or gather information about the system. Malware often uses such techniques to ensure it survives reboots or to collect data for exfiltration.\n\nAlso, the involvement of files related to Windows Defender (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll) might be a way to check if antivirus software is present or to bypass its detection mechanisms. This kind of activity can be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to avoid detection.\n\nThe high volume of events all tied to powershell.exe and these specific tasks makes me lean towards this batch being interesting from a security standpoint. It's not just random processes; it seems coordinated and possibly indicative of an attack or exploit attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity such as script execution and persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. That alone makes it worth looking into because attackers often use it to execute scripts or commands that can be hard to trace.\n\nLooking at the events, there are several instances where files are being created and deleted in temporary directories. For example, one event shows a file being created at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1' and then immediately deleted. This pattern of creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThere are also events where 'powershell.exe' is being called with ampersands, like 'powershell.exe & {}'. Ampersands in PowerShell command lines can sometimes be used to chain commands together or execute scripts. This could indicate that multiple commands are being run, possibly to download additional tools or communicate with a remote server.\n\nAnother thing I see is the loading of specific DLLs like 'clrjit.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. These might be legitimate for system operations, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries or use them as part of their attack chain. Without more context, it's hard to say if these are suspicious, but coupled with the other activities, they add to the concern.\n\nThere are events where other processes like 'whoami.exe' and 'conhost.exe' are being executed. 'Whoami.exe' is typically used to display user information, which could be part of lateral movement or reconnaissance within a network. If an attacker is trying to gather information about the system or user, this would make sense.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event involving 'winlogbeat.exe', which I believe is related to log management tools like the Elastic WinLogBeat. This might just be normal data collection activity unless it's interacting with other processes in a way that's outside the norm.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities: repeated PowerShell executions with command-line arguments, quick file creation\/deletion in temp directories, loading specific DLLs, and execution of system utilities. These could be signs of malicious behavior such as script execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the possibility that some of these actions are legitimate. For example, 'powershell.exe' is widely used for administration, so it's not inherently malicious. The same goes for 'whoami.exe' and 'conhost.exe'; they're standard utilities. But the combination and frequency might raise flags.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might be benign, together they show a pattern that could indicate an attack. To confirm, further investigation would be needed, such as checking process relationships, network activity around those times, and the content of any executed scripts or commands.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits several patterns that warrant attention for potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Executions**: The frequent use of 'powershell.exe' with command-line arguments suggests possible script execution, a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\n2. **File Manipulation in Temporary Directories**: Quick file creation and deletion in temp directories could indicate attempts to avoid detection by leaving no trace.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**: Events showing the loading of specific DLLs might be part of an attack chain or malicious activities, though they could also be legitimate system operations.\n\n4. **Execution of System Utilities**: Use of 'whoami.exe' and 'conhost.exe' may suggest reconnaissance or lateral movement within a network.\n\n5. **WinLogBeat Activity**: While likely related to log management, it's worth monitoring for any异常 interactions.\n\nGiven these points, while individual actions might be benign, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior.

Towards the end, I see another winlogbeat file creation, which seems unrelated but could be part of logging.\n\nSo, looking at these events together: a lot of activity from PowerShell and whoami.exe. Both are common tools for attackers to execute commands or gather information. The repeated process creations and accesses might indicate someone trying to escalate privileges or move laterally in the network. The registry change in one event could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nI should also consider if there's any missing data, like file paths or other indicators.
