{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create scheduled tasks. Each event has a slightly different task name but the core action is similar: scheduling calc.exe to run at login with high privileges. This stands out because using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks can be a common technique for persistence in malware or malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and processes, which could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or gather information, both of which are red flags for potential malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event involving chrome.exe creating a pipe and modifying the registry, though this might not be as concerning unless it's part of a broader pattern. However, considering that multiple powershell processes are involved in suspicious activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nFurthermore, the log shows several Image Load events for different DLLs when running powershell.exe. While this is normal for PowerShell execution, the combination with the scheduled task creations makes me cautious about potential payload delivery or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together, these logs indicate multiple instances of potentially malicious activities using elevated privileges and system-level changes. This could signal an ongoing attack where an adversary is setting up persistence mechanisms or deploying malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, targeting high privilege execution at logon, indicates potential malicious activity for persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, first off, I see that there are multiple JSON objects here, each representing an event. Each event has a process, a winlog task, and a file path.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're all from powershell.exe. The tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, and some command lines that look suspicious. For example, one of the command lines is trying to execute calc.exe using Powershell with some scheduled task actions. That seems a bit off because why would someone want to run calc.exe via a scheduled task? It could be a way to execute malicious code.\n\nThen there are entries from chrome.exe where registry values are being set multiple times. While Chrome does update its settings, the fact that it's doing this repeatedly might be worth looking into. Could there be some kind of persistence mechanism or tampering with system settings?\n\nThe latter part of the events shows \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks without any process or file information. That's concerning because executing remote commands can indicate command and control activities, which are often signs of malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Powershell is known for being used in both legitimate scripting and cyberattacks due to its powerful features. The creation and deletion of temporary files, along with scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe, might be part of a larger attack vector. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe could be an attempt to modify system configurations or install malware components.\n\nThe remote command executions are particularly worrying because they lack context, making it hard to determine their origin or purpose. This could be part of data exfiltration, installing backdoors, or other malicious activities.\n\nSo, considering all these factors together—suspicious Powershell activity, multiple registry modifications by Chrome, and numerous remote command executions—the batch as a whole definitely stands out as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including Powershell executing commands to run calc.exe via scheduled tasks, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, and multiple remote command executions.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through each one to see if anything stands out as suspicious.\n\nThe first event is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a known process related to Windows Management Instrumentation, so that seems normal unless it's doing something unusual here.\n\nNext are several entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common system process, and while many attacks use it, the fact that these are just registry changes without other indicators might not be enough on their own.\n\nThen there's an event where svchost.exe creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. That path is standard for Windows tasks, so maybe it's creating a new scheduled task. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nA couple of events show remote command executions with no process or file info. This could be concerning because executing commands remotely can be part of an attack, but I need more data points here.\n\nThere are two PowerShell.exe entries creating files in the user's directory and setting registry values. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating files like 'entrada_principal.txt' doesn't immediately raise a red flag, but combined with other actions, it could be part of a script execution.\n\nMultiple Chrome.exe events show image loads and registry changes. While Chrome can load various DLLs as part of its operation, the specific paths here look legitimate, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nThere are several entries from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. Winlogbeat is likely a log shipping tool, so these activities seem benign unless there's something unusual about the file paths or permissions.\n\nThe batch also includes multiple registry writes by svchost.exe and Chrome.exe. While this can be part of normal operation, excessive writes might indicate malicious activity, but again, without context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting all these together, there are some red flags like the remote command executions and PowerShell file creations, which could hint at potential malicious activities. However, a lot of the events are standard system operations. Without more specific indicators or patterns over time, it's difficult to conclusively say this batch is malicious. Therefore, I classify it as interesting but not definitively suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events indicating potential remote command executions and file creations by processes like svchost.exe and PowerShell.exe, which could be indicative of malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
