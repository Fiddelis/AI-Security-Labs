{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few entries all have 'powershell.exe' in the process command line. The command lines look similar but with slight variations in variable names like $object and task names such as 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc. They're using powershell to create scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon, targeting the Administrators group with highest privileges. That's a red flag because creating persistent tasks with high-level access is often part of malicious activities, like installing backdoors.\n\nNext, there are events where 'powershell.exe' interacts with the registry, specifically setting values (RegistryEvent) and accessing processes (ProcessAccess). These actions can be part of establishing persistence or modifying system configurations. Additionally, one event shows powershell.exe creating a new process (Process Create), which could be another step in executing malicious scripts.\n\nThere are also entries where 'chrome.exe' creates pipes and modifies the registry. While Chrome is a legitimate application, unusual pipe creations or registry changes could indicate tampering, but it's less concerning compared to the PowerShell activities.\n\nLooking at the file events, powershell.exe loads various .NET framework components, which isn't unusual on its own. However, combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds context that suggests something more malicious is happening.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and modifying system settings. These actions are common in attack chains for persistence and lateral movement. The repeated use of AtLogon triggers and targeting the Administrators group further indicates potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell.exe events creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges to execute calc.exe, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs. I need to determine if the entire set is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing malicious scripts, so any unusual activity with it should be flagged. Looking closer, one event shows a file creation in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`. Then, the same file is deleted shortly after. This pattern—create and delete—is common in attempts to avoid detection by deleting traces of malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell commands are being executed. Specifically, there's a script that creates a scheduled task using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` to execute `calc.exe`, which is typically harmless on its own but could be part of a persistence mechanism or a test to see if the command runs without issues. The use of `BUILTIN\\Administrators` as the principal with highest run level suggests an attempt to escalate privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events from Chrome.exe modifying registry values. While this can be legitimate for application updates or configurations, frequent changes might indicate suspicious activity, especially if paired with other unusual behavior like the PowerShell activities mentioned earlier.\n\nLooking at the end of the logs, there are multiple entries indicating \"Execute a Remote Command\" without any associated process or file. This could mean that remote execution is being attempted or monitored, which adds to the suspicion as it's often related to command-and-control (C2) communication or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these points together—malicious script creation\/deletion, scheduled tasks for calc.exe with elevated privileges,registry modifications by Chrome, and repeated remote command attempts—it seems highly indicative of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the combination of multiple red flags strongly suggests an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, along with remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from system logs.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events to get a sense of what's happening. Most of these events are from common processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and powershell.exe. Those are standard system processes, so that doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with each event: there are several registry value sets, file creations, image loads, and a couple of DNS queries. Registry activity can be suspicious if it's modifying sensitive areas, but in this case, the paths don't seem out of place. For example, taskschd.dll is a legitimate Windows component.\n\nI notice multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. While svchost is often used by malware, in this batch, there are other non-malicious processes also doing similar things, which might be part of normal operations. The same goes for chrome.exe—many registry writes aren't unusual for a browser.\n\nThere's one event where powershell.exe creates a file called entrada_principal.txt and another named objeto_auxiliar.txt. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful, but again, without seeing any signs of suspicious commands or indicators of compromise (like known malicious scripts), this might just be legitimate scripting activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated events from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. That makes sense if the system is using ELK for logging, so those are expected and not concerning.\n\nI also see an event where a remote command was executed twice. This could be a red flag because executing commands remotely can indicate malicious activity. However, without context on what exactly was run, it's hard to say. If these were legitimate administrative tasks, that might explain them.\n\nConsidering all events together, there are some potentially concerning activities like remote command execution and file creations by powershell.exe. But they aren't in isolation; other processes show similar behavior which could be normal. Without additional context or more specific indicators of compromise, it's hard to definitively say these actions are malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch does have some elements that might warrant closer look but aren't enough on their own to conclude they're malicious. Therefore, I think this batch is somewhat suspicious but not highly concerning without further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits some potentially concerning activities but doesn't provide sufficient evidence to confirm malicious intent. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Common Processes**: Events from svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and powershell.exe are noted, which while sometimes used by malware, can also be legitimate system operations.\n\n2. **Registry Activity**: Multiple registry writes don't appear unusual without specific indicators of compromise in sensitive areas.\n\n3. **File Creations**: Powershell creating files could be malicious, but without knowing the file contents or commands executed, it's uncertain.\n\n4. **Remote Commands**: Two remote command executions are noted but may be administrative tasks rather than malicious.\n\n5. **Logging Activity**: Winlogbeat events suggest normal logging setup, which is expected.\n\n**Conclusion**: The batch has elements that merit attention but aren't conclusive evidence of malware. Further investigation is needed to determine if these activities are legitimate or part of an attack. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"finding\": \"Potentially Suspicious\",\n  \"score\": 45,\n  \"explanation\": \"The events include actions like remote command execution and file creation by powershell.exe, which could be malicious but lack sufficient context to confirm.\"\n}\n```"}
