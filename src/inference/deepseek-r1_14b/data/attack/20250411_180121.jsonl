{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they involve chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I notice some powershell.exe events. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. The command line in one of them stands out: it's using powershell to download a file from a GitHub URL and saving it to %env:TEMP%. Downloading files from raw.githubusercontent.com isn't inherently bad, but the context matters.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is downloading files from different GitHub repositories. Each command_line entry has a similar structure, which suggests a pattern. The filenames being saved in the TEMP directory also vary, like modulo_padrao.txt and others. This repetition might indicate automation or script execution.\n\nAnother red flag is that after some of these downloads, there's a file creation followed by deletion. For example, one event creates __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 in the TEMP folder and then immediately deletes it. Deleting scripts could be an attempt to remove evidence or avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, the process events show powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which is consistent with how powershell runs scripts but can also be part of malicious behavior like persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's a combination of activities that raise concerns. Multiple attempts to download files from GitHub, especially using WebClient, could indicate script execution. The repeated pattern suggests this might be part of a larger script or module being fetched and executed. The file deletions after creation are suspicious too, possibly trying to hide traces.\n\nWhile some parts like the initial network connections in chrome.exe are normal, the powershell activities with external downloads and self-deleting scripts stand out as potentially malicious. Therefore, this batch is likely relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes downloading files from GitHub repositories and executing them in the TEMP directory, with some evidence of file deletion after creation, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs. I'm trying to figure out if these events are interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, the commands download LICENSE.txt files from different branches and save them to temporary locations like %env:TEMP%. This could be concerning because PowerShell scripts often have legitimate uses but can also be a vector for malicious activity, especially when downloading files directly from the internet.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, there are several entries related to file creation and registry changes. For example, powershell.exe creates files like estrutura_temporario.txt and tarefa_ativo.txt in the user's temporary directory. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but could be part of a script's execution.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does perform such operations during its normal operation, multiple repeated registry changes might warrant attention, especially if they're not typical for user interaction.\n\nAnother point is the download of winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat.exe. This seems legitimate as it's part of the ELK stack used for log management, but seeing it appear multiple times could indicate configuration changes or updates, which in some contexts might be suspicious.\n\nI also see MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection. Since this is related to Windows Defender, it's expected behavior as it scans for threats over the network, so probably not malicious here.\n\nThe high number of registry modifications and file creations across different processes could indicate script activity or automated tasks. While some might be benign, the combination with powershell downloading files raises the risk of potential malware execution.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activities. The repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub, coupled with extensive file and registry operations across various processes, suggests a possible script or tool deployment that could be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories and creating temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where svchost.exe is modifying the registry with 'Registry value set'. Svchost.exe is a common system process, so seeing it accessing the registry isn't unusual on its own. But I notice this happens several times—maybe that's part of legitimate operations or could it be something more?\n\nNext, there are instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being used with specific command lines. For example, one cmd.exe command deletes a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for \"modulo_temporario\". Another uses REG DELETE to remove \"pacote_auxiliar\". These commands seem like they're trying to clean up traces of other processes or maybe remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries, there are multiple 'Process accessed' events. Powershell can be used maliciously, but without seeing actual script execution or known malicious commands, it's hard to tell. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might just be legitimate use, like scripting tasks.\n\nThere's also a process named conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is often used in command-line environments and by default isn't suspicious unless it's executing unusual commands.\n\nI see SCHTASKS being used with \/Delete to remove a task called \"spawn\". Task deletion could be part of uninstalling software, but again, if done maliciously, it might be an attempt to remove evidence or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe is running, which is typically harmless unless it's used in a way to gather system information for later misuse. The command line here doesn't show anything beyond the standard execution.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple processes accessing and modifying the registry, deleting specific keys and scheduled tasks. This behavior could indicate someone trying to remove traces of previously run malicious software or cleaning up after an attack. Alternatively, it might be a legitimate cleanup process by software during uninstallation.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with commands that delete registry entries and tasks raises some flags. Malware often deletes its own traces to avoid detection. The combination of these events could suggest a potential threat actor attempting to cover their tracks.\n\nI should also consider if any of these processes are running outside their usual contexts or if the command lines seem unusual. For example, if these commands are part of legitimate system administration tasks, they might not be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nIn conclusion, while some activities could be normal, the pattern—especially the repeated deletions and use of powershell and cmd.exe—is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. It would be wise to check for any other signs of malicious activity, such as unexpected file changes or network traffic, and possibly run these processes through sandboxing tools or threat detection systems.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns indicative of potential suspicious activities, particularly the multiple instances of registry modifications, deletions of specific registry keys and tasks, and the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe. These actions could be part of legitimate system administration but may also suggest an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **svchost.exe Registry Access:** Multiple events show svchost.exe accessing the registry with 'Registry value set'. While svchost is a standard process, repeated access might warrant monitoring.\n\n2. **Registry Deletions via cmd.exe and reg.exe:** Commands delete specific registry keys under HKCU, possibly removing persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\n3. **Powershell.exe Activity:** Several events indicate powershell.exe being accessed, which can be malicious if executing scripts but could also be legitimate use.\n\n4. **SCHTASKS Usage:** Deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\" might be part of uninstallation or an attempt to remove evidence of prior activity.\n\n5. **Whoami.exe Execution:** Typically benign unless used for reconnaissance in attacks.\n\n6. **Conhost.exe and cmd.exe Registry Interactions:** These processes are generally not suspicious on their own but could indicate misuse if combined with other actions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observed activities, while possibly legitimate, exhibit characteristics often associated with malicious actors attempting to erase their presence. To mitigate risks:\n\n- **Investigate Further:** Look for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as unexpected file changes or network anomalies.\n- **Monitor Processes:** Continuously monitor the use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for suspicious commands.\n- **Use Threat Detection Tools:** Employ tools that can analyze process behavior and detect potential threats.\n\nThis cautious approach is advisable given the potentially malicious nature of the observed activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. There are 23 events here. Most of them involve powershell.exe. Let me go through each one.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe with a task Process accessed. Then there are multiple Provider Lifecycle tasks, which might be normal PowerShell activity. Some have command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems a bit odd but could be part of script execution.\n\nNext, I see a Registry value set event from powershell.exe. That's concerning because writing to the registry can indicate malicious behavior. Then there are several Image Load events loading various DLLs. Some of these paths look legitimate, like mscoree.dll and others under .NET Framework. However, one is MpOAV.dll, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's a security-related file, but I should check that.\n\nThen there's a File created event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. That filename looks suspicious. It seems like a test script, but why is it being created and deleted immediately after? The next event deletes this file, which might be an attempt to remove traces.\n\nLooking further, there are Pipe Created events and more File Create\/Registry access from powershell.exe. One event creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's unusual because it's related to PowerShell profiles, but maybe it's just being used for persistence or configuration.\n\nThere's also an event from conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is typically used as a host for other processes, so I'm not sure why it's modifying the registry here.\n\nPutting this together: Multiple powershell.exe instances with various activities, including script creation and deletion, DLL loading (some potentially suspicious), and registry modifications. The repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks might indicate script execution or module loading. The creation of a temp script and its quick deletion is red flag behavior to avoid detection. Plus, the registry writes could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because there are several signs that could indicate malicious activity, like unusual file operations,registry changes, and multiple processes interacting in ways that aren't clearly legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show suspicious activities including script creation\/deletion, DLL loading, registry modifications, and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few events involve processes like whoami.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for attacks, so that's something to keep in mind. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and creating files. For example, there's a file creation event of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1' in the Temp directory. Then immediately after, it's deleted. That seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file could be part of an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving long traces.\n\nLooking deeper, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell but could also indicate that some modules or scripts are being loaded which might have malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process named conhost.exe accessing the registry and cmd.exe being used with command lines like \"\/c\" which typically runs a command and then exits. Cmd being used in this way can sometimes be part of command injection attacks or script execution.\n\nThe events show multiple instances where powershell.exe is started with \"& {}\" as the command line, which isn't typical usage. This could be an attempt to execute arbitrary commands or scripts through PowerShell, potentially indicating malicious activity.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks associated with powershell.exe. These might be part of a larger chain of events where multiple processes are being spawned and manipulated in quick succession, possibly attempting to evade detection or establish persistence.\n\nThe combination of these activities—registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, unusual PowerShell usage—is concerning because it aligns with common tactics used in cyberattacks such as credential dumping, lateral movement, or setting up backdoors. The repeated attempts to create and delete files could be an attempt to test if script execution is allowed or to bypass certain security policies.\n\nConsidering the volume of events and the specific actions taken, especially the PowerShell activity involving script creation and deletion, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes. That's not unusual on its own since PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But the number here stands out—there are multiple entries with different command lines, some even executing scripts that delete files or interact with the system in ways that could be suspicious.\n\nI see several Registry value sets from various processes like Calculator.exe, Chrome.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. While these actions aren't inherently malicious, the combination of so many changes across different legitimate-sounding processes might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\nThe creation of files in specific locations, like the Startup folder for PowerShell profiles, could be a sign of an attempt to maintain access on subsequent logins. This is a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to ensure their tools run every time the system starts.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's one that deletes a .zip file from the TEMP directory. Deleting files can be part of an attacker's cleanup process after exfiltrating data or deploying malicious payloads. The fact that it's using a script (powershell.exe & { ... }) adds to the suspicion because scripts are often used to automate and hide malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading various .NET components. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the extensive list might suggest the execution of more complex code or an attempt to load modules that could be obfuscated or malicious.\n\nThe combination of these factors—multiple PowerShell processes with varied commands, file deletions, registry modifications across different processes, and potential script executions—creates a pattern that raises concerns about possible malicious activity. The frequency and diversity of actions are beyond typical user behavior, making the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe with suspicious command lines, file deletions, registry modifications across different processes, and potential script executions indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. They're all JSONL format, one object per line. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events involve 'powershell.exe'. That's already a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands or downloading payloads. So any repeated use of powershell.exe could be concerning.\n\nLooking closer at the events:\n\n1. The first event shows powershell.exe loading an image, specifically MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal since defender might interact with scripts.\n2. Then there's a file creation in the Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Temporary script files can be part of legitimate operations, but they could also be used by malicious scripts to test execution without being saved permanently.\n3. Next, that same temporary file is deleted. So it was created and then removed. This sequence might indicate a script checking its environment or trying to avoid persistence by not leaving the file around.\n4. There are multiple events where powershell.exe is using Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory with various names like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. The fact that they're deleting multiple files from the temp folder could be part of cleaning up after some activity, which might be suspicious if it's automated or follows a pattern.\n\nI also see that these events repeat several times with different file paths but similar commands. This repetition suggests a script running multiple deletions, perhaps in a loop or as part of a larger process. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore is another point because attackers often suppress errors to avoid detection.\n\nAnother thing is the registry access and image loads. For example, when powershell.exe accesses MpClient.dll, which is again related to defender, but also the Registry value sets could be for persistence or modifying system configurations in a malicious way.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe runs. That might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with other activities, it could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n\nI should also consider whether these actions are part of normal user behavior. If this were a legitimate admin script, maybe the deletions would be expected, but the combination of temporary files, repeated deletions, and specific file names (like tarefa_base.zip which translates to something like 'base task' in Portuguese) might not align with typical system operations.\n\nMoreover, the events involving chrome.exe loading certain DLLs could be part of normal operation, but since they're paired with other suspicious activities, it's worth noting.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe instances performing file deletions in a patterned way, creating and immediately deleting temporary script files, combined with registry modifications. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity, possibly related to script execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\nI should also think about the frequency and volume of these events. There's a significant number of powershell.exe events in a short period, which could be unusual unless there's a legitimate reason for it.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individual actions might not raise red flags, the combination, repetition, and specific file operations suggest that this batch of logs is worth investigating further for potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Use of PowerShell**: The frequent invocation of `powershell.exe` is notable. While legitimate, it's often abused in cyberattacks for executing commands or downloading payloads.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Operations**: Creation and immediate deletion of temporary script files (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1`) suggest efforts to avoid detection by not leaving persistent traces on the system.\n\n3. **Patterned Deletions in TEMP Directory**: Multiple `Remove-Item` commands targeting various `.zip` and `.txt` files in the TEMP directory indicate a possible cleanup routine, which could be part of malicious activities aimed at erasing evidence.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**: Events involving registry value sets (`RegistryEvent`) may indicate attempts to achieve persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\n5. **Use of Error Suppression**: The `-ErrorAction Ignore` parameter suggests an attempt to suppress errors, a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection.\n\n6. **Suspicious File Names and Actions**: Filenames like `tarefa_base.zip` (translating to \"base task\") don't align with typical system operations and may indicate targeted actions.\n\n7. **Repetition and Volume of Events**: The significant number of `powershell.exe` events in a short period could signal automated or malicious script execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these factors strongly suggests that the batch of logs warrants further investigation. These activities could be part of an attack vector, such as script execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this log batch is deemed **interesting for investigation** due to the potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) present.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe log batch contains suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious behavior. It is therefore classified as interesting for further investigation.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}

For example, a file is created with a .ps1 extension and immediately deleted.

Additionally, there are multiple registry access events and file creations\/deletions across various locations, including AppData and Downloads folders, which are common targets for malicious activities.\n\nThe combination of creating temporary scripts, deleting files in the TEMP directory, accessing the registry, and using whoami suggests a possible script execution to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries from chrome.exe performing Registry value sets. These are pretty common activities since Chrome interacts with the registry for settings and extensions. The same event repeats multiple times, which doesn't raise any immediate red flags on its own.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe doing a Registry set. That's also normal as it's part of Windows' background processes managing runtime components.\n\nNow, I notice several instances of whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to the system32 directory. Whoami is typically used to get user information, and executing it from system32 isn't unusual. However, seeing multiple executions might be worth looking into, but in this case, each seems a standalone process creation without any suspicious command-line arguments.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe entries are more concerning. They show ProcessAccess tasks, which involve accessing or manipulating processes. Since PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious activities like remote code execution or lateral movement, multiple accesses could indicate potential unauthorized activity. But I need to see if there's any unusual command-line arguments or other events linked with these powershell.exe calls.\n\nLooking further, there are file creation events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely an agent collecting logs, so that's normal. The PowerShell creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt could be part of script execution, but without knowing the content or context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nConsidering all these events together, I don't see clear indicators of compromise like known exploit codes, unusual file hashes, or direct evidence of data exfiltration. The repetition of certain processes and registry accesses might indicate automated behavior, possibly from scripts or legitimate software updates, but without more context on the environment, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nHowever, the frequency of PowerShell access could be a point of interest. If this volume is higher than usual for the system, it might warrant closer examination. Additionally, multiple whoami.exe executions could be part of an internal script or automated tooling checking user permissions, but without more data, it's speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements that merit attention, particularly around PowerShell usage and process creation events, they don't collectively rise to the level of clear malicious activity based solely on this log snippet.
