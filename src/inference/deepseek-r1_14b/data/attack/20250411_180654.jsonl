{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'll go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries from Chrome.exe modifying registry values. Registry changes are common and usually not suspicious on their own, especially from a well-known application like Chrome. However, repeated modifications could be worth monitoring, but in this case, it's likely just normal activity.\n\nNext, there are several events involving whoami.exe being executed. This is a standard system utility used to display user information. While sometimes used maliciously for reconnaissance, the presence of a single instance without additional indicators like privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\nThe bulk of the events involve powershell.exe, which is a double-edged tool often used by both administrators and attackers. The command lines show that PowerShell is executing scripts with paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name suggests it's designed to capture keystrokes, which could be malicious if未经允许。Moreover, these scripts are being run with the -LogPath parameter pointing to temporary files, possibly for logging keystrokes without user consent.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components. While legitimate scripts might load these, the combination with the Get-Keystrokes script increases suspicion as it could be part of a broader malicious activity like persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThe frequency and pattern of these PowerShell executions, especially the repeated command lines pointing to different script paths but all performing similar actions, suggest a potential automated or batched execution. This behavior isn't typical for legitimate use cases and aligns with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as lateral movement or persistence.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the pattern of multiple PowerShell executions with keystroke-capturing scripts and repeated registry modifications from Chrome could indicate malicious activity. The confidence level is high due to the combination of suspicious script executions and potentially harmful activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with names like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which may indicate malicious activity such as keylogging. Additionally, repeated registry modifications from chrome.exe could be suspicious.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines pointing to different script paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script is known for capturing keystrokes, which could indicate potential malicious activity as it's often used in keylogging attacks. The fact that the script is writing logs to temp files (key.log) raises a red flag because such behavior isn't typical for legitimate scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are several file creation and deletion events involving temporary files created by powershell.exe. For example, the script creates a file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1) and then deletes it. This kind of activity can be an attempt to avoid detection or to temporarily store malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry value sets from both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure they start with the system boot. It's concerning because such changes can allow attackers to maintain access even after a system restart.\n\nOther events involve file creations related to legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe, which is an ELK component for log management, and svchost.exe, a common Windows service host process. However, these don't seem out of the ordinary unless there's something unusual in their associated paths or actions, which doesn't stand out here.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated powershell executions with keylogging scripts, temporary file creation\/deletion, registry modifications—all these activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior. While some events could be benign, the combination suggests a higher likelihood of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts and suspicious file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
