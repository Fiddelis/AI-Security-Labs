{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each representing different activities on a system. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows that 'powershell.exe' created a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be associated with malicious activities. Creating a file, especially without much context, might warrant looking into.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from 'chrome.exe' where it sets registry values. Chrome sometimes modifies the registry for updates or settings, so that could be normal user activity unless there's an unusual number of such events or they're accessing sensitive keys.\n\nThen, there's a process creation event for 'whoami.exe', which is typically used to determine user information. This isn't inherently malicious but can be part of privilege escalation if used in conjunction with other activities. It's worth noting here because it appears alongside PowerShell usage.\n\nLooking further down, another PowerShell execution stands out. The command line shows a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being run, which sounds like it's designed to log keystrokes. That's definitely something malicious because such scripts are often used for keylogging to steal sensitive information. The script is saving logs to the TEMP directory, which is common for avoiding detection but also suspicious.\n\nThere are more events where PowerShell accesses other processes and loads various .dll files. This can be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the execution of a malicious script like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, it raises red flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' under winlog for different PowerShell executions. This could indicate that the system is tracking process events, which might be normal, but again, paired with the other suspicious activities, it's something to look into.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes a script execution (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) known for malicious purposes, multiple unusual PowerShell commands, and registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential unauthorized access or malicious activity on the system. While individual events might not be alarming, their combination raises concerns about a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell executions with potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), file creation in user's directory, registry modifications, and repeated process accesses. These indicate potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I've got a batch of log events from some system logs, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious because it implies it's capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to steal sensitive information like passwords.\n\nThen, I see multiple events where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating files. For example, there are file creations in temporary directories with names that look like they're trying to blend in, such as '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1'. Temporary files can be part of malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated creation and deletion of files. The first event shows a file being created but then immediately deleted. This could be an attempt to clean up traces, which is typical in attacks to evade detection.\n\nI also notice that the same script path is referenced multiple times across different directories. This repetition suggests that it's part of a persistent mechanism or perhaps different instances of the script running at different times or locations on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are creating files. While these processes can be legitimate, they're often targets for attackers to hide their activities under the guise of normal operations.\n\nThe fact that multiple entries involve registry value sets could indicate that something is trying to establish persistence in the system, allowing malicious code to survive reboots or resume after being interrupted.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious scripts, file creation\/deletion patterns, and attempts to modify system configurations (like registry) strongly suggest this batch of logs warrants investigation. These activities could be indicative of a cyberattack aiming to gather sensitive information or establish a foothold in the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple PowerShell executions of scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which are known for keystroke logging. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion patterns indicating potential malicious activity attempting to remain undetected.\"\n}\n```"}
