{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a few instances where svchost.exe is doing DNS queries and network connections. Svchost is a common system process, but sometimes it can be used maliciously. However, these logs don't show anything too suspicious yet—just standard DNS activity and network connections. Not a red flag on their own.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with both DNS queries and network connection detections. Browsers do this all the time when loading pages, so that's pretty normal. No cause for concern here unless there's something unusual about the URLs or traffic patterns, but nothing stands out.\n\nThen, powershell.exe appears several times with events like ProcessAccess, Registry value sets, and others. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers because it can do so much, including executing scripts and accessing system resources. The fact that it's being used multiple times could be a sign of something malicious, but I need to look closer at the specific actions.\n\nLooking at some command lines, there are cmd.exe processes with commands like adding users to the domain. Specifically, they're using net.exe and net1.exe to add users and groups, such as \"pacote_principal_Admin\" with passwords like \"registro_temporario_pass123!\". These look suspicious because the usernames and passwords seem to follow a pattern—maybe part of an automated attack or credential stuffing.\n\nThere are also entries where conhost.exe is accessing registry values. Conhost is another system process, but it's often used in command-line tools. The fact that it's modifying the registry could be part of legitimate operations, but again, context matters. Combined with other events, this might warrant closer look.\n\nAdditionally, winlogbeat.exe is creating files in a specific directory, which seems related to log shipping or monitoring. That’s not unusual unless there's an irregularity in how it's accessing files or if the files created are unexpected.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of process creations (cmd.exe and powershell.exe), network connections from chrome.exe, and user additions using net commands with specific usernames and passwords that follow a pattern. These behaviors could indicate credential stuffing, lateral movement within the domain, or an attempt to create backdoor accounts.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.7 because while some activities are concerning, there's no clear indication of malicious intent in each event alone. However, the combination—especially the repeated use of net and powershell commands with similar patterns—points towards potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as repeated network connections from chrome.exe, numerous process creations involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe, and user additions using net commands with specific patterns in usernames and passwords.
