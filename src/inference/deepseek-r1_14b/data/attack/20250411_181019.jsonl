{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe being accessed or created. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access could be a red flag. Also, in some cases, powershell is used with command lines that might execute scripts, which could indicate script execution—maybe something malicious.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe processes creating services like 'win32times' using sc create. The command lines have paths to .ps1 files that don't exist, which seems suspicious. Creating a service with a non-existent script path might be an attempt to set up persistence or execute malicious code on startup. This behavior is often seen in malware trying to maintain access.\n\nThere are also several instances of Registry value sets across various processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Modifying the registry can be part of installing malware components or creating persistent keys for malicious activities. The fact that multiple processes are doing this could indicate a coordinated attack where different parts of the system are being altered.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where cmd.exe sets a Registry value pointing to a script in 'c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Since the path doesn't exist, it might be trying to execute non-existent code, which is odd and possibly malicious. Similarly, sc.exe is used to create and query services, which again ties into potential persistence mechanisms.\n\nI also notice that some processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe are involved in Registry events. While these might seem benign, their involvement could mean they're being exploited or part of a larger attack chain. The urlmon.dll loaded by Calculator.exe is another point to consider—malware sometimes injects malicious code into legitimate processes.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be related to log management, but if it's behaving abnormally, it could be an attacker trying to cover their tracks or exfiltrate data. However, without more context on its activity, this is less concerning than the other points.\n\nTaking all these together—the repeated use of powershell and cmd with suspicious commands, the creation of services with non-existent scripts, multiple Registry modifications across different processes—this batch shows a pattern indicative of potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is attempting to establish persistence, drop malware components, or move laterally within the system.\n\nWhile I can't be certain without more detailed analysis (like process hashes or exact command lines), the combination of these events raises enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including powershell.exe accesses, creation of services with non-existent scripts, and registry modifications. Indicators suggest potential malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and used with different rules like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The fact that it's accessing registry values might raise some flags, especially if the commands aren't standard administrative tasks.\n\nI notice a command line in one of the powershell.exe events: \"powershell.exe -noni -nop -w hidden\". This is concerning because \"-noni\" and \"-nop\" disable the interactive session, meaning there's no window popping up, which can be a tactic to avoid detection. The \"-w hidden\" makes it run without showing any visible window, making it stealthier.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. These are system processes, but they shouldn't typically make changes to the registry unless something is wrong. Malware often injects itself into legitimate processes like svchost.exe to hide its activity, which could explain these events.\n\nThen there's a mention of Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator doesn't need to load such a DLL, especially from the system32 directory. URLMON is related to handling URLs and might be linked to malicious activities like downloading files or establishing connections. This could indicate that Calculator.exe is being used as a vehicle for executing some payload.\n\nAlso, the file created by winlogbeat.exe seems normal unless it's part of an attack to log keystrokes or collect data. It's creating a YAML configuration file, which isn't inherently malicious, but it's worth keeping an eye on if there are other anomalies around it.\n\nThe frequent RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe are also puzzling. While Chrome can interact with the registry for extension installations or settings, multiple events could indicate suspicious activity, especially if they're not tied to known legitimate processes.\n\nPutting this all together, the unusual PowerShell usage, hidden windows, registry modifications by non-standard processes, and unexpected DLL loadings point towards potential malicious activities. These could be signs of a malware infection attempting to stay under the radar by using legitimate processes and tools.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided logs, the cybersecurity expert concludes that the batch exhibits concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key observations include suspicious PowerShell usage with stealth indicators, unexpected registry modifications, and unusual DLL loadings, all suggesting possible malware presence. Therefore, these logs are deemed **interesting** from a security standpoint.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}
