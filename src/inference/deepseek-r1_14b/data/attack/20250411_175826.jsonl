{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of events from different processes on a system. The main processes involved are chrome.exe and powershell.exe.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because browsers do make network connections and DNS queries regularly. So, no red flags there.\n\nThen, the logs switch to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so I need to pay attention here. Looking at the events, powershell.exe is involved in several actions: Process accessed, Registry value set, Image loaded, File creation and deletion, Pipe Created, and some Provider Lifecycle tasks.\n\nOne event catches my eye where powershell.exe is executing a command that modifies file timestamps using Set-ItemProperty. The paths mentioned are C:\\modulo_logico\\registro_base and similar. This seems like an attempt to change the last write time of files to make them appear older or newer, which might be a tactic used in malware or persistence mechanisms to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts (__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1). This could indicate that the script is being created, executed, then deleted to remove evidence. Malicious actors often do this to evade file-based detection methods.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks from both powershell.exe and notepad.exe. Modifying the registry can be part of establishing persistence or changing system configurations maliciously. The fact that notepad.exe is also modifying the registry is unusual because it's a common application and such activity might not be typical unless it's being used as part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to point towards logical structures with terms like 'modulo_logico', 'registro_base', which might suggest a structured approach to tampering with system components. The repeated use of powershell.exe for various operations without clear legitimate context (like user executing scripts) adds to the suspicion.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might look normal, the combination—especially the PowerShell activities involving file timestamp changes, temporary script usage, and registry modifications—stands out as concerning. This could indicate potential malicious activity or at least something that needs further investigation into its source and intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe performing potentially suspicious activities, including modifying file timestamps, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and registry modifications. These actions could indicate malicious behavior or attempts to avoid detection.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of events here, all in JSONL format. Each line has a process, winlog, and file details.\n\nFirst off, I notice that there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines that involve modifying LastWriteTime on various files. The command seems to be setting the last write time to January 1, 1970, which is a classic trick used in malware to make files appear older or to avoid detection by certain tools. This could be an attempt to manipulate file timestamps, possibly to hide recent changes.\n\nThen there are several events from svchost.exe and conhost.exe setting registry values. Svchost.exe is commonly associated with services and can be legitimate, but it's also used by malware to execute code. The fact that it's modifying the registry multiple times might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also an event where Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator typically doesn't need to load such a DLL, which is often related to URL handling and could indicate some form of injection or malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous Registry value sets by chrome.exe, which is unusual since Chrome shouldn't be making so many registry changes in a short period. This might suggest that either the browser is being manipulated or another process is using it as a vector.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, multiple processes (especially PowerShell) showing file manipulation and registry changes could indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or file tampering to cover tracks. The high number of Registry writes by different processes, including svchost.exe and chrome.exe, adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being potentially malicious because the combination of file timestamp changes, unusual DLL loads, and excessive registry modifications isn't typical for legitimate activity. These behaviors are often red flags in cybersecurity, pointing towards possible attacks or malware attempting to maintain persistence or alter system states to avoid detection.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` instances with command-line arguments modifying file timestamps. This is concerning as it's a common tactic in malware to obscure file activity.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry and File Modifications:**\n   - `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` making numerous registry changes. These processes are often used by malware for persistence or configuration.\n   - A `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`, which is atypical and could indicate malicious code injection.\n\n3. **Excessive Registry Writes:**\n   - Several entries from `chrome.exe` modifying the registry, which is unusual behavior for a web browser, suggesting possible exploitation or misuse.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The combination of file timestamp manipulation, DLL injections, and excessive registry activity points towards potential malicious intent, such as creating persistence mechanisms or evading detection.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - These behaviors collectively suggest a high probability of malicious activity, warranting further investigation into each process's origin and purpose.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity, including suspicious file modifications, unusual DLL loads, and excessive registry changes by multiple processes. Therefore, the logs are likely **interesting** from a cybersecurity perspective due to these concerning patterns."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event is from chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows Registry for settings.\n2. Next event has no process name and task info; probably an error or unrelated activity.\n3. Third event again is chrome.exe setting another registry value, similar to the first one.\n4. Fourth event: chrome.exe loading a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll. ASI stands for Anti-Malware Scan Interface. Malicious processes might try to load this to hide themselves, but Chrome needing it makes sense since it's a legitimate system file.\n5. Fifth event: chrome.exe loading another DLL related to Windows Defender. That seems okay too, as Defender often injects into processes.\n6. Sixth event repeats the registry set task from chrome.exe.\n7. Seventh event is winlogbeat.exe creating a new config file, which is expected if it's an agent collecting logs.\n8. Eighth event: powershell.exe creates a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks. The filename doesn't immediately raise flags but could be part of malicious activity.\n9-14: Multiple chrome.exe events setting registry values, which we've seen before.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch, most events are normal Chrome activity—registry modifications, loading system DLLs. The powershell.exe creating a file stands out because it's a common tool for attackers but doesn't necessarily mean anything malicious here without more context. Also, there are several repeated actions from chrome.exe, which might just be part of its operation.\n\nI should consider if the repetition or combination indicates something suspicious. For example, multiple registry writes could be part of a persistence mechanism. However, since it's coming from Chrome, which is a known process, it's less likely to be malicious. The powershell event is a bit concerning but without more events showing unusual behavior (like execution of scripts, access to restricted areas, etc.), it might not be enough on its own.\n\nSo overall, while there are a couple of points that could raise eyebrows, they don't combine into a clear indication of malicious activity when looking at the entire batch. Therefore, I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal Chrome process activities such as registry modifications and loading system DLLs. The powershell.exe creating a file is not inherently suspicious without additional context, and repeated actions from chrome.exe are likely benign.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
