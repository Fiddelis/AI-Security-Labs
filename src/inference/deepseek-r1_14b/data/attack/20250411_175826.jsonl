{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial events from chrome.exe, they're showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome regularly makes internet connections and resolves domains. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe processes. I know PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. Let's see what these instances are doing.\n\nThe first powershell.exe event is a process access, which might mean it's being monitored or interacting with other processes. Next, there's a registry value setâ€”modifying the registry isn't inherently bad, but certain changes can be indicators of compromise (IOC). Then, there's a file creation and deletion in the user's Temp directory. Creating and then deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the command lines for these PowerShell instances, I notice they're using syntax like `Get-ChildItem` and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". This seems suspicious because modifying file timestamps could be part of data tampering or attempting to hide changes. The paths mentioned, like \"\\\\modulo_logico\\\\registro_base\", seem arbitrary but might indicate an attempt to manipulate specific files.\n\nThere are several instances where powershell.exe is loading different .dll files. While PowerShell does load various assemblies, the specific ones here don't immediately ring alarms, but combined with other actions, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother event shows a process named RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values. Notepad typically doesn't interact with the registry much unless it's running scripts or handling certain file operations. This could be unrelated, but it adds to the overall picture of potential system changes.\n\nThe last two events are about \"Provider Lifecycle\" in PowerShell. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to, but providers in PowerShell deal with different data stores like theregistry, filesystem, etc. If these are part of custom scripts, they could be legitimate or part of malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell instances performing file operations (creation\/deletion), modifying registry values, and changing file timestamps, plus some network-related actions from Chrome, make me think this batch is not normal. These actions could indicate scripting activity meant to alter system behavior or hide traces, which are common in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell, including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and potential timestamp manipulation, indicate possible malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being used with specific command lines. The commands all seem to be modifying file last write times to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That's a classic tactic in malware to make files look older or reset their timestamps, which can help avoid detection by some tools. This might indicate an attempt to hide recent changes to the system.\n\nNext, I notice multiple instances where svchost.exe is involved and there are registry value sets. Svchost.exe is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The fact that it's making changes to the registry repeatedly could be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify configurations.\n\nThere are events involving Calculator.exe loading URLMON.DLL, which seems unusual. Normally, Calculator.exe wouldn't need to load such a DLL, so this might be an indicator of a process injection or some form of malicious behavior where legitimate tools are being misused.\n\nAnother point is the event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. While WinLogBeat is a common log shipping tool, seeing it create configuration files could be normal, but it's worth checking if this activity aligns with expected behavior or if it's part of an attack chain, like dropping malicious configs.\n\nThere are also events where Chrome.exe sets registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, excessive writes without a clear reason might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern of activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where conhost.exe accesses the registry and another where ApplicationFrameHost.exe does the same. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools, but again, if it's making unexpected changes, it could be a red flag.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple processes (PowerShell, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe) are performing actions that don't align with typical user behavior, especially the registry modifications and file timestamp adjustments. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence or altering system configurations to hide traces of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution with unusual file modification, registry value sets by svchost.exe and other processes, and Calculator.exe loading unexpected DLLs. These indicate possible malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on the system.\n\nFirst, looking at these events, most of them are coming from 'chrome.exe'. It seems like Chrome is doing a lot here. The tasks associated with Chrome processes include setting registry values and loading images. Now, Chrome does do some legitimate operations, so that's not necessarily suspicious yet.\n\nBut wait, there are several instances where the task is \"Registry value set\". That catches my eye because making changes to the Windows Registry isn't something a browser typically does frequently. If this were happening once or twice, it might be normal, but doing it multiple times in a row could indicate malicious activity trying to persist across reboots.\n\nAlso, there are events where Chrome is loading system files like 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. Those sound like legitimate Windows Defender components. Maybe Chrome needs them for some functionality? I'm not sure if that's normal behavior or if it might be an indicator of something else.\n\nLooking at another process here: 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'unidade_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, and creating files with custom names could be part of malicious scripts. This could be a red flag since legitimate use would usually have more predictable filenames or paths.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file in the user's Downloads folder. That seems odd too. WinLogBeat is usually used for log shipping, but if it's executing as a process and writing files in user directories, especially under a non-standard path like '.winlogbeat.yml.new', it might not be standard behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry writes from Chrome could be trying to establish persistence or alter system settings. The PowerShell activity with an arbitrary filename raises concerns about script execution. WinLogBeat's unusual file creation adds another layer that doesn't seem normal. Combining these points, the batch shows several indicators that might point towards malicious behavior, making it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and suspicious file creations by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
