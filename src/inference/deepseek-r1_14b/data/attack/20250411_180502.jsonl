{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. The user wants a single classification and justification.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. There are several events from 'chrome.exe' with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity, especially DNS lookups and connections. So these might not be suspicious on their own.\n\n2. Then there are multiple entries from 'powershell.exe'. The first one shows that a PowerShell script is being executed using the command line with a path like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\" which seems like it's navigating up directories. This could be a red flag because scripts running in this way might indicate file traversal, possibly trying to access restricted files.\n\n3. Next, there are several Image Load events from PowerShell, loading various DLLs. That's normal as part of script execution, but I should keep an eye on the paths to see if they seem legitimate or not.\n\n4. Then a File Create event for a temporary .ps1 file and immediately after that, a File Delete logged event. Creating and then deleting a temp file quickly could be a sign of trying to avoid detection, like creating a malicious script temporarily to execute and then delete it to leave no trace.\n\n5. There are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events from PowerShell with different command lines. These again involve starting processes with .bat files in various paths that seem to navigate up directories. The fact that there are several such events with similar structures might indicate automated or malicious script execution, possibly trying to run scripts from different locations.\n\n6. Lastly, an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry. That's a bit unusual since it's often associated with UI components, and unexpected registry changes could be malicious.\n\nPutting this together: The batch includes multiple PowerShell activities that involve creating temp files, deleting them quickly, navigating directories to possibly access different scripts, and making registry changes. These behaviors are concerning because they can be indicative of malicious activity like script execution or persistence mechanisms. While Chrome's activities are normal, the PowerShell actions raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, this batch is interesting for investigation as it could signal potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion and registry modifications indicate possible malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the repeated activity from both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. There are multiple entries where these processes are accessing the registry or loading images, which could be normal, but in such large numbers, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is involved in several tasks like setting registry values and creating files. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and executing commands. The fact that it's being used multiple times with different operations raises the red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few events where cmd.exe is running scripts from specific paths, which could be another sign of malicious activity since command-line tools are commonly used in attacks. There's also an event where conhost.exe is involved, which might be part of a process injection technique to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the file creation by powershell.exe for componente_principal.txt. Without knowing the context, it's hard to say if this is legitimate or part of an attack payload.\n\nThe high number of registry changes across different processes suggests potential tampering with system configurations, which could be a sign of malware attempting persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple process creations, numerous registry modifications, and file operations by potentially malicious tools—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities such as setting registry values and creating files, combined with other process creations and registry modifications across different processes, indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe where the task is \"Registry value set\". That seems a bit off because Chrome doesn't usually modify the registry in such a way repeatedly. Maybe it's part of some update process or extension activity, but seeing seven of these in a row raises an eyebrow. Malware often uses the registry for persistence, so multiple writes could be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are two other processes: winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack used for log management. The file created by it seems normal as it's related to its configuration. But then there's powershell.exe creating a file named 'elemento_base.txt'. PowerShell is commonly misused in attacks, so any file creation could be malicious. The filename doesn't ring any bells immediately, but combined with the other events, it adds concern.\n\nLooking at the overall picture: seven registry writes by Chrome, followed by log entries from legitimate tools but also a suspicious PowerShell activity. This combination suggests potential malicious behavior. It's possible that an attacker is using Chrome for some activities or leveraging other processes to establish persistence or move laterally.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation by powershell.exe suggest potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}
