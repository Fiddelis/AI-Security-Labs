{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, they all involve 'chrome.exe' making network connections. That's normal for a browser, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen I notice several events from 'powershell.exe'. The command lines show that PowerShell is starting other processes, specifically batch files located in various paths like '\\\\..\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\...' etc. This is concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks for PowerShell, there are registry modifications and image loads. These activities can be part of legitimate operations but can also indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory, which might suggest an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up after executing some malicious code.\n\nFurther events show multiple instances where PowerShell is creating pipes and accessing providers, which could be signs of communication between processes or setting up persistence points. The varied paths in the command lines don't follow a standard structure, raising suspicion about their legitimacy.\n\nThe last event is from 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' modifying the registry, which might not be inherently malicious, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it adds to the overall concern.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—abnormal PowerShell activity, file creation and deletion in Temp, multiple process creations for unknown scripts, and potential registry tampering—it's clear that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior. The combination suggests possible scripting or payload execution, which is definitely something that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell executing external scripts and creating temporary files, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few Calculator.exe processes accessing the registry. That seems normal because many applications need to modify settings stored in the registry. But then I notice multiple powershell.exe instances doing various things like setting registry values, accessing processes, loading images, and even creating files. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for command execution, so repeated use could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, chrome.exe is setting a lot of registry values. While Chrome does do some registry operations, the sheer number here—like multiple entries—might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're in areas not typically accessed by the browser.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe running a script from \"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The path seems a bit complex and uses \"..\" which could be trying to access parent directories. This might be an attempt to reach sensitive areas, so that's concerning.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance is executing \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\", another script from a non-standard location. The fact that both cmd and powershell are running scripts suggests potential malicious activity, as attackers often use these tools for execution of payloads.\n\nThe creation of a file by svchost.exe is interesting too. Svchost is a legitimate system process, but it's sometimes hijacked by malware. If this instance created a file in a user directory, it could be part of an infection or persistence mechanism.\n\nFinally, powershell creating a file in the user's downloads folder for \"componente_principal.txt\" stands out. It's unusual for legitimate scripts to create files there without a clear purpose, especially if they're named in a way that suggests they're part of a larger component.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (powershell, cmd, svchost) executing scripts from various locations, modifying the registry extensively, and creating files. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate malicious intent or an attack. The high number of events related to these processes increases my concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing scripts, along with extensive registry modifications and file creation activities, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the events provided.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe and the task is 'Registry value set'. This happens several times. Typically, legitimate software like Chrome might interact with the registry during normal operation, especially when installing extensions or updating settings. So, these alone don't raise a red flag unless they're unusual in frequency or context.\n\nThen there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping and management. It's standard for it to create configuration files, so this seems normal.\n\nThe last event is powershell.exe creating a file called elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used by administrators for scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The creation of a new file might be concerning because malicious scripts could drop files as part of their payload or persistence mechanisms. However, without additional context like unusual command-line arguments or multiple such events, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together: there are several legitimate-looking activities from Chrome and winlogbeat, plus one PowerShell event that's a bit suspicious. Since only one out of eight events is potentially problematic, the overall risk might be low. But I should consider whether multiple registry changes could indicate something malicious. If these were happening in rapid succession or with non-standard data, it would be more concerning.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as NOT INTERESTING because most of the activities are benign, and there's insufficient evidence to suggest malicious behavior from the single PowerShell event without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly legitimate system activities with only one potential red flag. The multiple registry changes by Chrome.exe are normal, and the PowerShell activity lacks sufficient context for concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
