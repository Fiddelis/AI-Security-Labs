{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if the batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each event represents. Looking at the events, they include processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, etc., along with various tasks such as DNS queries, process creations, registry changes, and file accesses.\n\nI'll go through each event one by one:\n\n1. **chrome.exe** doing a DNS query – that's normal.\n2. **powershell.exe** setting a registry value – PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but not all registry writes are bad; it depends on what key and value.\n3. **cmd.exe** running systeminfo and reg query – systeminfo is usually benign, but querying the registry could be part of legitimate admin tasks or something more nefarious.\n4. Another powershell.exe accessing a process – this could indicate process injection or lateral movement.\n5. cmd.exe setting another registry value – similar to point 2.\n6. **systeminfo.exe** being created and loading AMSI DLL – systeminfo is typically harmless, but loading AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) might be trying to bypass detection.\n7. More **powershell.exe** events with registry changes and process access – cumulative evidence points towards potential misuse of PowerShell.\n8. **svchost.exe** creating files and modifying the registry – svchost is a legitimate process, but sometimes used by malware for persistence or other activities.\n9. **WmiPrvSE.exe** being created with specific command-line arguments – this can be associated with WMI attacks, which are often part of advanced persistent threats.\n10. Various processes like Calculator, conhost, services, etc., performing normal tasks.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, multiple events involve PowerShell and cmd.exe executing commands that could be malicious. The repeated use of these tools along with registry modifications and file creations might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the system. Additionally, the involvement of svchost.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe adds more concern as they can be vectors for malicious activities.\n\nHowever, some events could also be legitimate admin tasks or user actions. But considering the combination and frequency, it's hard to ignore the possibility of malicious intent. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell and cmd.exe executing commands that could indicate potential malicious activity, such as registry modifications and process access. Additionally, the presence of processes like svchost.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe with unusual activities further suggests possible suspicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from Calculator.exe and chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit odd because I don't think Chrome typically sets registry values that frequently unless something is wrong. But more importantly, there are several instances where chrome.exe loads modules like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those files sound familiar—amsi.dll is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is used by Windows Defender. However, if an application like Chrome is loading this module abnormally, it could be a sign of something malicious trying to hide or inject code.\n\nThen there's the powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for executing scripts. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other events, it might suggest some script activity.\n\nAlso, the winlogbeat.exe process creating a new configuration file seems normal if that's part of its setup, but I'm not sure why it would create a .new file unless there's an update or misconfiguration happening.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated registry writes by Chrome and Calculator could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms. Loading system protection modules might be attempts to hide malicious activities or inject code into legitimate processes. Plus, the powershell.exe activity adds another layer that needs scrutiny. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Chrome.exe setting registry values and loading system protection modules, along with Calculator.exe and PowerShell activities, indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}"}
