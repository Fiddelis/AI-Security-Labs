{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events involve `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe`. The command line in one of the powershell.exe events has a script that searches for files containing \"pass\" using findstr and select-string with the pattern \"password\". That seems suspicious because it's looking for sensitive information, which could indicate data theft or unauthorized access.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, combined with the previous script execution, it raises flags about potential malicious activity.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted in the same location by powershell.exe. This temporary file creation and immediate deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection, which is common in malware.\n\nThere are several events where the command line of powershell.exe repeats the same script multiple times. Repetitive execution of such scripts could suggest automation or persistence mechanisms, possibly part of a larger attack.\n\nA process named `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely monitoring logs, which isn't suspicious on its own, but it's worth noting the context to ensure it's legitimate.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing the registry might be related to reading or writing configuration data. It's not inherently malicious, but combined with other events, it could indicate someone tweaking system settings after initial compromise.\n\nFinally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is standard behavior and doesn't raise concerns.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe with scripts searching for sensitive information, coupled with attempts to delete temporary files and load multiple DLLs, suggests potential malicious activity. These patterns are often seen in attacks aimed at data exfiltration or persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines searching for sensitive information, temporary file creation\/deletion, and repeated process access events, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from various processes. The first event is about powershell.exe loading a DLL file (MpClient.dll). Powershell can be used maliciously, so that catches my eye. Then there's another powershell process with a command line looking for strings like 'pass' in XML and other files, which seems suspicious—it might be trying to find sensitive information.\n\nNext, I see svchost.exe making registry changes twice. SvcHost is usually legitimate but sometimes used by malware. The Calculator.exe events are normal unless they're doing something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here since it's just loading a DLL.\n\nThere's also an OfficeClickToRun.exe making a DNS query, which could be part of normal operation or data exfiltration. The findstr.exe event is another red flag because it's searching for 'pass' in various files, possibly trying to extract credentials.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe creates files and modifies the registry. This activity can be indicative of malicious behavior, especially when combined with other suspicious actions like searching for passwords. Additionally, conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry might not be normal either.\n\nThe Chrome.exe process has several registry writes and DNS queries. While Chrome is a common application, multiple registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. The winlogbeat.exe event seems benign as it's related to log file handling.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple signs of potentially malicious activity—powershell command line arguments searching for sensitive info, repeated registry modifications by different processes, and the use of tools like findstr which can be indicators of compromise. These activities could indicate an ongoing attack or data exfiltration attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events including powershell.exe searching for sensitive terms, registry modifications, and potentially malicious file operations.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. chrome.exe loading a DLL file from Windows Defender. That seems normal because Defender updates its components.\n2. chrome.exe making network connections. Browsers do that all the time for web traffic, so nothing suspicious here.\n3. powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used maliciously, but sometimes it's legitimate. The filename doesn't ring any bells immediately.\n4. More registry activity from chrome.exe. Again, normal if Chrome is updating settings or extensions.\n5. A Dns query with no process name. Could be anything, hard to say without more context.\n6. winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. That's part of the logging setup; expected behavior.\n7. powershell.exe creating another file 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. Again, PowerShell activity and file creation, but not enough info yet.\n8. A process with no name, probably irrelevant or an error.\n9. More winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is normal.\n10. powershell.exe accessing a process. Could be legitimate admin work or malicious activity.\n11. whoami.exe running without any command line arguments, just to get user info. Not unusual unless it's part of a larger sequence.\n12. cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks with specific names. This is concerning because deleting tasks could indicate tampering with system behavior. The command uses '\/f' which forces deletion without confirmation.\n13. schtasks.exe creating a process and loading a DLL, then deleting another task. Similar to above, this might be trying to remove scheduled tasks that are monitoring or protecting the system.\n14. svchost.exe registry changes. Svchost is a common system process; however, unexpected registry changes can indicate issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has multiple instances of legitimate processes doing normal things (like Chrome and winlogbeat), but there's also activity involving PowerShell creating files, deleting scheduled tasks via cmd and schtasks, which are red flags. These could be signs of a malicious script trying to remove monitoring tools or create backdoors.\n\nSo overall, while some events are normal, the combination of using command-line tools to delete system tasks and create files with suspicious names suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as PowerShell file creation, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, which could be attempts to remove monitoring tools or establish persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several instances where schtasks.exe is being used with the command-line argument to delete a scheduled task. That might be suspicious because deleting tasks could indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable monitoring tools. But then again, admins do this regularly, so it depends on context.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for cmd.exe and powershell.exe accessing the registry. Registry activities can be part of normal operations, but repeated writes or deletions might suggest malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nI notice a command line in one of the cmd.exe events where it's trying to delete notepad.exe processes. Using wmic to delete processes could be an attempt to terminate legitimate tools or other malware instances, which is a red flag for potential malicious behavior.\n\nLooking further, there are several WMIC.exe entries loading various DLLs and interacting with the registry. WMIC is often used in attacks because it's a powerful tool for remote commands. The fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded might indicate an attempt to bypass certain security measures or execute arbitrary code.\n\nThere are also attempts to delete user accounts using net.exe and net1.exe. Deleting users, especially ones with Admin privileges like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"componente_comum_Admin\", is concerning because it could be an attempt to remove evidence or disable user accounts as part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple high-risk activities: deleting scheduled tasks, using WMIC for process deletion, registry manipulation, and account deletions. These actions don't seem to be part of normal system administration but instead point towards potential malicious behavior aimed at compromising system integrity or covering tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially malicious activities including deletion of scheduled tasks, process termination using WMIC, and registry modifications which could indicate unauthorized access or attack.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are being used with commands that modify user accounts or delete services. For example, the command lines show actions like deleting users (e.g., \"net user ... \/del \/domain\") and removing services (\"sc delete win32times\"). These activities can be legitimate but might also indicate malicious behavior if not explained.\n\nI notice a pattern of repeated commands across different processes. The same or similar commands appearing multiple times could suggest automated or script-driven activity, which might be part of an attack. Additionally, the use of 'whoami.exe' and accessing registry values via various processes might be attempts to gather information or make persistent changes, which are red flags.\n\nThe combination of deleting users, modifying services, and registry changes is concerning. These activities could be part of privilege escalation or efforts to maintain persistence in a system. The presence of multiple process creations and accesses adds to the suspicion that something unusual is happening.\n\nWhile some events on their own might not raise alarms, together they form a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity. This makes the batch as a whole interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations and accesses, including powershell.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, and sc.exe, which are often used in malicious activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell.exe is involved in a registry value set. That's a bit concerning because scripts often manipulate the registry, but alone it's not enough.\n\nNext, cmd.exe runs some delete commands on temp files. This might be part of normal operations, especially if these files are leftovers from previous processes.\n\nThen another PowerShell access event and more cmd.exe registry writes. The pattern suggests repeated use of cmd.exe and PowerShell with different tasks.\n\nLooking further, there's a file deletion by cmd.exe pointing to a specific path. That could be suspicious because deleting files can hide evidence or remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nNow, I see multiple events where conhost.exe and whoami.exe are used. Whoami is usually harmless, but if it's being called with certain parameters, it might indicate token manipulation for privilege escalation.\n\nThere are several PowerShell events involving image loads and provider lifecycles. This seems like normal operation as PowerShell loads its components, but repeated instances could hint at something more.\n\nThen there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a .ps1 script in the temp directory. Creating and immediately deleting a script might be an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving traces on disk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (cmd.exe and PowerShell) performing registry modifications, file deletions, and creating\/deleting temporary files could indicate malicious activity. The repeated use of these commands across different events makes me think this isn't just normal system behavior but might be part of an attack chain—possibly script execution attempts or persistence mechanisms.\n\nSo yes, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated use of cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe with suspicious activities such as registry modifications, file deletions, and temporary script creation\/deletion, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a bunch of system log events here that I need to analyze. The goal is to figure out if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first line: it's a PowerShell process creating a pipe. That's normal because PowerShell often uses pipes for communication, especially in scripts. Next, another PowerShell instance shows up under 'Engine Lifecycle', which also seems routine since that's part of how PowerShell operates.\n\nThen there's an event where a file is loaded from the Windows Defender directory. Defender is a legitimate Microsoft product, so it makes sense that its DLLs are being loaded. Not suspicious here. Moving on, another file creation by PowerShell in a user's profile folder. That could be normal if it's part of script execution, but I'll keep an eye out for other signs.\n\nThere's a registry value set by PowerShell, which is common because scripts often interact with the registry. Then conhost.exe does something similar, accessing the registry. Conhost is usually related to console hosting, so that doesn't raise red flags on its own.\n\nWhoami.exe runs next. That tool is commonly used to check user information and isn't inherently malicious. However, if it's part of a larger script or executed multiple times, it might be worth noting, but here it seems isolated.\n\nI notice multiple entries where processes are accessed by PowerShell. This could be normal if PowerShell is interacting with other services or processes, but too many might indicate something fishy. Also, there are several instances of winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is probably related to log management software like the Elastic Stack, so that's benign.\n\nCalc.exe and Calculator.exe both load urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL used in various Windows components, including system processes. This doesn't seem suspicious unless they're being used in an unusual way.\n\nLooking through all these events, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious activity like known bad file paths, strange process trees, or access to restricted areas. Most activities are typical userland operations and common script behaviors. While there's a lot of PowerShell activity, without additional context indicating misuse, it doesn't cross into suspicious territory.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system processes such as PowerShell executions, file creations in user directories, and legitimate program operations like whoami.exe and calc.exe. There are no signs of malicious activities or unauthorized access.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if they're worth investigating. \n\nStarting with the first event, there's a process named winlogbeat.exe that created a file in a specific path. That seems normal because it's likely the log agent itself writing its configuration or data files.\n\nNext up, I see powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be a red flag if misused. However, without seeing any command-line arguments or more suspicious activities from this process, it might just be a regular script running.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed with the standard path. This tool is typically used to display user information and isn't inherently malicious unless used inappropriately, like for privilege escalation.\n\nAnother instance of powershell.exe accessing something again. Still no red flags without context on what it's doing.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe entries show registry modifications. ApplicationFrameHost is a legitimate Windows process, and Calculator is just an app that might tweak some settings or update itself. Registry changes alone don't indicate malware unless they're modifying known malicious keys.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events: there are multiple DNS queries and network connections. Browsers do this all the time when navigating the web, so these entries are expected and not concerning on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, each event individually seems benign or part of normal system operations. There's no consistent pattern of malicious activity across the logs. No unusual file creations, strange process behaviors, or multiple indicators pointing to an attack vector. The activities observed fit typical user behavior, like running scripts, checking system info, and browsing.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't raise any red flags that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as log file creation by winlogbeat.exe, legitimate process access by powershell.exe and whoami.exe, registry modifications by ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe, and expected network activity from chrome.exe. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies in the batch.\"\n}\n```"}
