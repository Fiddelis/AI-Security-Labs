Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, so I should pay attention. The events show that powershell.exe accessed registry values and loaded various DLLs, which is normal but could indicate malicious activity if combined with other actions.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell processes: It's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in certain file types like .xml and .txt. That sounds concerning because it might be looking for passwords or sensitive info. Select-string with a pattern for \"password\" is another red flag—attackers often look for such terms.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe created a temporary script, then immediately deleted it. This behavior could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving evidence behind. Also, repeated events with the same command line suggest automated or malicious scripts running multiple times.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat creating a file, which is likely related to log collection and probably benign. Notepad accessing registry values isn't unusual but worth noting if there's more context. Calc loading urlmon.dll seems normal as well.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated powershell activity with search patterns for sensitive information, plus the creation and deletion of a script file, suggests possible malicious intent.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll. Powershell is commonly used in scripts, both legitimate and malicious. Loading this specific DLL isn't immediately suspicious, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNext, there's a process command line with findstr searching for 'pass' in various file types. This could be part of data mining or credential harvesting. The use of select-string suggests they're looking for patterns, which might indicate malicious intent.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is modifying the registry. Svchost is a legitimate system process, but unexpected registry changes can be signs of malware installing persistent mechanisms.\n\nMultiple events show svchost.exe and other processes like Calculator.exe accessing or creating files and registry entries. These could be part of normal operations, but frequent activity might raise flags.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that involve findstr and select-string. This combination often appears in scripts meant to extract sensitive information, which makes me more cautious.\n\nThere are multiple chrome.exe events with registry modifications and DNS queries. While chrome can have many legitimate activities, the frequency of these events might indicate something malicious, like data exfiltration or tracking.\n\nOne event stands out where winlogbeat.exe creates a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, but if it's creating unexpected files, especially in user directories, it could be suspicious.\n\nOverall, the batch includes several red flags: powershell scripts with potential malicious commands, multiple registry modifications that might indicate persistence, and unusual file accesses.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see... The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I notice that there are multiple entries from 'chrome.exe' with various tasks like Image loaded, Registry value set, and Network connection detected. These seem pretty standard since Chrome does a lot of background activities, including loading libraries and accessing registries. But then I see some network connections—four in a row. That might be something to look into because multiple connections could indicate data being sent out or an attempt to communicate with external servers.\n\nNext, there's an event from 'powershell.exe' where a file named 'objeto_logico.txt' was created. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly abused in attacks. The creation of files via PowerShell could be suspicious, especially if the filename doesn't seem standard.\n\nThen there are more events from Chrome accessing registries multiple times. That might not be too concerning on its own, but combined with other actions, it could raise an eyebrow. Also, I see a DNS query event without a process name, which is a bit odd because usually, a process would trigger a DNS lookup. Without knowing the process, it's harder to assess if this is normal or malicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are more PowerShell events creating files and accessing processes. This repetition makes me think that maybe something is being set up or configured using scripts. The creation of multiple text files in the Downloads folder might be part of data exfiltration or setting up a configuration for malicious activities.\n\nThere's an event where 'cmd.exe' was used to delete scheduled tasks. Schtasks is a legitimate tool, but deleting tasks via command line could indicate someone trying to remove traces of their activity or disable monitoring tools. The use of 'cmd.exe' with specific commands to delete tasks might be part of a script to clean up after an attack.\n\nAnother event shows 'schtasks.exe' creating a process and loading a library. Scheduled tasks are common, but again, if they're being created or modified by another process, especially via scripts, it could be malicious.\n\nLastly, there's an entry from 'svchost.exe', which is known for hosting various services. The RegistryEvent here might not be unusual on its own, but combined with the other events, it adds to the picture of potential tampering with system configurations.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are multiple network connections from Chrome, file creations by PowerShell, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd.exe, and manipulation of schtasks and svchost. These actions collectively don't definitively prove malicious activity, but they do raise several red flags that warrant closer investigation. The use of legitimate tools for potentially malicious purposes is a common tactic in cyberattacks, so the context here suggests possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several activities that raise suspicion and merit further investigation:\n\n1. **Multiple Network Connections from Chrome**: Four consecutive network connections from 'chrome.exe' could indicate data transmission or communication with external servers, which might not be typical user activity.\n\n2. **File Creation via PowerShell**: The creation of files like 'objeto_logico.txt' by 'powershell.exe' is notable because PowerShell is frequently used in malicious activities. This action should be examined for potential abuse.\n\n3. **Registry Access and Scheduled Task Deletion**: Events showing registry modifications and the deletion of scheduled tasks using 'cmd.exe' suggest possible attempts to remove traces or disable monitoring tools, which are red flags for potential unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Manipulation of Schtasks and Svchost**: The use of 'schtasks.exe' and 'svchost.exe' in creating processes and accessing registries could indicate configuration changes or malicious scripts aiming to alter system behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while these activities don't conclusively prove malicious intent, they collectively present significant red flags. Further investigation is recommended to assess the context and determine if unauthorized access or malicious activity has occurred."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event has schtasks.exe deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because it's using the task scheduler, which can be used for persistence. Then another event shows schtasks loading taskschd.dll, which is normal for task scheduler.\n\nNext, there are several events involving svchost.exe accessing the registry and cmd.exe with command lines that try to delete processes like notepad.exe. That seems odd because deleting processes could be part of removing traces or stopping monitoring tools.\n\nThere's also a lot of activity from powershell.exe being accessed multiple times and setting registry values. Powershell can do a lot, both good and bad, so repeated access might indicate malicious activity, especially when combined with other commands like wmic and cmd.\n\nLooking at the WMIC.exe events, they're trying to delete processes as well. Using wmic to manage processes is another red flag because it's often used in command-line attacks for tasks like process termination or starting new ones.\n\nI notice multiple deletions of user accounts using net.exe and net1.exe. Deleting users, especially administrative ones, could be an attempt to remove traces or elevate privileges, which is a common sign of malicious behavior.\n\nThere are several registry modifications spread throughout the logs. Registry changes can indicate configuration of system settings, persistence mechanisms, or altering security policies, all of which are concerning when seen in bulk.\n\nThe repeated use of different executables (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, schtasks.exe) and their command lines suggests a pattern of attempting to perform tasks that might be obfuscating or removing traces. This combination could indicate an attack chain where multiple tools are used to achieve the goal.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of process creation, registry manipulation, account deletions, and attempts to delete processes. These activities don't seem like normal user behavior. They look more like someone trying to clean up after themselves or installing malware that's being removed. The repeated use of different tools and commands also points towards potential malicious intent rather than legitimate operations.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events suggests possible unauthorized access, persistence mechanisms, or attempts to cover tracks. The confidence level is around 0.85 because while each individual event might not be too concerning on its own, the accumulation and pattern make it likely that something malicious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including process deletions, registry modifications, user account deletions, and use of tools like powershell.exe and WMIC.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior or attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and figure out if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There are a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe instances. Both are common tools, but they can be used for malicious purposes too. For example, cmd.exe is often used in command-line attacks, especially with commands like net user or sc delete. Powershell is another tool that's known to be used by attackers because it has scripting capabilities and can do things that might be hidden from view.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks and processes:\n\n- There are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses processes (ProcessAccess). That in itself isn't necessarily bad, but if combined with other activities, it could indicate something suspicious. Powershell is often used for executing scripts or commands, which can be malicious.\n  \n- The cmd.exe process has some command lines like \"\/c net user ... \/del \/domain\". This looks like an attempt to delete a user account from the domain. Deleting users, especially with 'Admin' in their names, could indicate someone trying to remove user accounts possibly for unauthorized access or to cover their tracks.\n\n- Similarly, there's a command: \"cmd.exe \/c sc delete win32times\". The 'sc' command is used to manage services, and deleting the 'win32times' service might be an attempt to disable monitoring tools or security services. If this service is related to system performance or logging, its deletion could hinder detection mechanisms.\n\n- There's also a whoami.exe process being created multiple times. Whoami is typically used to display user information, but when combined with other activities, it can be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nLooking at the log tasks: there are several Registry value sets and Process accesses. Modifying registry values could be an attempt to change system configurations, perhaps disabling security features or altering startup processes. The fact that multiple different processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, services.exe) are modifying the registry suggests a concerted effort, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe repeated pattern of creating and accessing processes, along with registry modifications, could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence, disable security measures, or delete traces of their activity. The use of different tools (cmd, powershell, net.exe) in sequence might be part of a script or automated process designed to carry out these actions.\n\nI also notice that some events are repeated multiple times, like the Registry value sets and Process creations. This repetition could be an attempt to mask individual activities by blending them into normal noise, making detection harder.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of potentially malicious activities: user account deletions, service removals, registry modifications, and process accesses using common tools that can be abused for attacks. These actions don't seem to fit typical user behavior unless part of legitimate system administration, but given their nature and repetition, they are more likely indicative of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activities including user account deletions, service removals, registry modifications, and repeated process creations using tools known for abuse.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Both are common tools used by attackers for command execution and scripting. The cmd.exe processes have commands that delete files in the Temp directory, which might be an attempt to remove traces or clean up after malicious activities. This could indicate an attacker trying to cover their tracks.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's a lot of activity related to process access, registry changes, image loading, and file operations. The repeated calls like \"powershell.exe & {}\" seem suspicious. They might be part of a script or command execution that's attempting to load malicious code or execute commands without being easily detected.\n\nI notice several RegistryEvent tasks in both cmd.exe and powershell.exe logs. Malware often uses the registry to persist, so these could be setting up persistence mechanisms. The file deletions and creations under Temp also raise flags because attackers might use temporary files for staging or executing malicious code.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running, which is typically used to check user privileges or identify the current user. This could be part of reconnaissance activities to understand the system's context before more aggressive actions.\n\nThe combination of these events—using cmd for file deletions and registry modifications, plus PowerShell's diverse activities including image loading and file operations—is a red flag. It suggests possible malicious behavior such as script execution, persistence setup, or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile it's possible that some of these could be legitimate user actions, the volume and specific types of events make it more likely that this batch is indicative of an attack. The use of both cmd and PowerShell in quick succession adds to the suspicion, as attackers often chain multiple tools for different purposes.\n\nGiven all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because it shows signs of potential malicious activities, including file manipulation, registry changes, and process injection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe, including file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated PowerShell executions which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're worth investigating. They provided JSONL data with various processes and events.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. Most are from PowerShell.exe, which often raises red flags because it's commonly used in malicious activities. There are several instances where PowerShell is creating files or accessing registry keys. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with others, they might indicate something's off.\n\nI notice that whoami.exe is being executed multiple times. This tool can be used to gather system information, which attackers often do to escalate privileges or move laterally in a network. The repetition here could suggest an attempt to gather detailed user info.\n\nLooking at other processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe, these are usually benign. Conhost is part of Windows for console services, and Winlogbeat is related to log management. However, their interaction with PowerShell might still be worth monitoring if they're used in unusual sequences.\n\nFile creations under the user's AppData folder by PowerShell could be writing configuration files or scripts. This isn't inherently malicious, but without more context, it's hard to say. The file paths mentioned don't immediately flag as suspicious, but combined with other events, they might warrant closer look.\n\nRegistry modifications are common during legitimate operations, but multiple writes from different processes can indicate tampering. For example, svchost.exe writing registry keys could be normal for services, but too many such events without a clear purpose might signal malicious activity.\n\nThe event where PowerShell loads MpClient.dll is interesting. This DLL is part of Windows Defender, so it seems like a legitimate action. But attackers sometimes abuse legitimate processes by loading modules they control, so this needs consideration.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple indicators that could be malicious. High frequency of PowerShell activity with file and registry interactions, plus repeated use of whoami.exe, create a concerning pattern. However, without additional context like timestamps or user behavior, it's challenging to definitively classify each action as malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events raises enough flags that an analyst should look into them further. The confidence isn't too high because some actions are common, but the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell.exe activity combined with file creation, registry modifications, and process accesses, which could indicate potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of whoami.exe and other processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe adds to the suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see if anything stands out.\n\nThe first event shows that winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... That seems normal because winlogbeat is typically an agent used to collect logs, so it might be updating or creating its own configuration files. I don't see any red flags here.\n\nNext, there are two events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, without seeing the actual command line arguments or knowing what exactly was done, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious. But on its own, process access isn't necessarily bad unless there's something else indicating misuse.\n\nThen, whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard system utility used to display user information. It doesn't do anything malicious by default, so this event alone isn't concerning.\n\nLooking further, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both set registry values. These are legitimate processes for Windows applications. Registry changes can be normal, especially during software updates or configuration changes. There's nothing unusual here unless the changes themselves are known to be malicious, which I don't see evidence of.\n\nThe majority of events involve chrome.exe making DNS queries and establishing network connections. Browsers do this all the time as part of their operation—resolving domain names and connecting to servers. It doesn't indicate any malicious activity on its own, especially since it's a well-known application.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these individual events seem suspicious in isolation. There are no signs of unusual file accesses, creation of hidden files, execution of scripts without proper cause, or activities that are characteristic of malware behavior like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or inconsistencies with user activity times.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the combination of these events could imply something more. For instance, seeing powershell.exe and whoami.exe together might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use powershell for elevation or lateral movement. But in this case, there's no indication that powershell was used to execute any malicious commands—it just accessed processes. Additionally, the number of chrome.exe network activities is high but within normal bounds for a browser.\n\nAlso, the winlogbeat creating a new config file could be an attempt to modify logging behavior, which might be concerning if not expected. But without more context about whether this is part of a routine update or unexpected, it's hard to say. Since there are only these events and no others suggesting misconfiguration or data exfiltration, I wouldn't classify this as suspicious.\n\nSo overall, the batch doesn't show any clear signs of malicious activity when looked at as a whole.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including log file creation by winlogbeat.exe, process access and creation by legitimate processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe, registry modifications by standard applications, and typical network and DNS activities from chrome.exe. No indicators of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
