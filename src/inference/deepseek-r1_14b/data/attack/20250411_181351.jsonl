{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the batch of system log events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one and then see if there's a pattern or something malicious.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's about powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and by attackers, so this alone isn't suspicious yet. The second event is whoami.exe running, which is a standard command to check user information—it doesn’t raise any red flags.\n\nNext, there are multiple events of powershell.exe accessing processes. That's a bit concerning because repeated access could be an attempt to gather information or lateral movement. Then, svchost.exe accessing the registry—svchost is a legitimate process but it can sometimes be used by malware for hiding activities, especially when combined with registry modifications.\n\nI see several events where powershell.exe sets registry values. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, which attackers use to maintain access on a system. That adds some concern because such actions are often part of malicious activity.\n\nThe next few events show powershell.exe loading various image files like mscoree.dll and others. While these are legitimate DLLs used by .NET Framework, the repeated loading might be part of a script trying to load multiple modules or components, which could indicate scripting activities that need monitoring.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is run with a specific command line argument. The command seems to involve adding a type in PowerShell and capturing the screen into a bitmap file. This looks suspicious because screen capture scripts can be used for malicious purposes like screenshots of sensitive information or as part of ransomware. The fact that it's saving images to different files (like unidade_logico.png, tarefa_comum.png, etc.) might indicate multiple attempts or different parts of the attack.\n\nMultiple events repeat similar command lines with slight variations in filenames. This repetition could be an indication of a script looping or running multiple times, which is common in attacks for persistence or to capture various data points over time.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a lot of PowerShell activity, including registry modifications and screen captures. While individual actions might not be suspicious, the combination—especially repeated use of powershell.exe with specific commands that have potential malicious intent—is concerning. The fact that these events are spread across several entries in the log suggests a possible attack chain where an attacker is using legitimate tools inappropriately.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events don't have file information, which could mean they're part of a broader campaign without direct file drops, making them harder to detect but still indicative of malicious activity through process and registry manipulations.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch seems interesting because it exhibits multiple signs of potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.85) because while some activities could be benign, the pattern strongly suggests something more nefarious.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity. Key factors include repeated PowerShell usage with suspicious command-line arguments involving screen capture scripts and registry modifications, which are often employed in attacks for persistence and data exfiltration. These activities collectively suggest a high likelihood of nefarious intent, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n\n**Classification: Interesting for Investigation**\n\n**Confidence Level: 0.85 (High)**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve taking screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory. The command lines include things like adding system types, capturing the screen, and saving as PNG files. This seems suspicious because taking screenshots in such a way could be part of data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\n\nThen there are events where files are being created and deleted by powershell.exe, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1. Creating temporary scripts might indicate that some malicious script is being generated or executed. The fact that the file gets deleted shortly after creation adds to the suspicion because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nI also see events related to registry value changes and process accesses. Powershell.exe accessing registry keys could be normal administrative tasks, but combined with other suspicious activities, it raises flags. Additionally, there are multiple entries where remote commands are executed, which is concerning as this can be a sign of command-and-control communication or unauthorized script execution.\n\nLooking at the variety of processes involved—powershell.exe, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe—it's notable that some of these are legitimate tools but often used maliciously. For instance, powershell.exe is commonly abused in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nThe high number of events tied to powershell.exe and the repeated pattern of creating temporary files, taking screenshots, and modifying registry entries suggests a coordinated activity rather than normal user behavior or system noise. This could be indicative of a script running multiple steps to gather information, maintain persistence, or perform other malicious tasks.\n\nAlso, the deletion of the created file immediately after its creation is a red flag because it's an attempt to remove evidence. Attackers often delete logs or files they create to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these points together—screenshot capturing, temporary script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, remote command execution—the pattern strongly suggests potentially malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of events is definitely worth investigating further as they could be signs of a cybersecurity incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activities**: Multiple instances where powershell.exe executes commands to take screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory. This behavior is often associated with data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: Temporary scripts (__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1) are created and immediately deleted, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Powershell.exe accessing registry keys could be part of establishing persistence or altering system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution**: Events show remote commands being executed, potentially signaling command-and-control communication or unauthorized script execution.\n\n5. **Use of Legitimate Tools**: Processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are involved, which, while legitimate, can be abused in attacks.\n\n6. **Pattern of Activities**: The repeated pattern of creating temporary files, taking screenshots, and modifying registry entries suggests coordinated activity, possibly indicating a script with malicious intent.\n\nGiven these factors, the events collectively suggest potential malicious behavior warranting further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze, and I need to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see how I should approach this.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of each event. Each line is a JSON object with three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The process seems to be running 'chrome.exe' every time. The winlog key has different tasks associated with it, like Registry value set or Image loaded, and there's a file path sometimes.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. The first six events all have 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' as the task in winlog, and the process is chrome.exe. No file path mentioned.\n2. Then there's an event with a 'Dns query' task.\n3. Next, two events where the task is 'Image loaded', each loading specific files:\n   - One loads C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll\n   - The other loads C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll\n4. Then another event back to 'Registry value set'.\n\nSo, I need to analyze the entire batch collectively.\n\nFirst thought: Chrome.exe is a common process that does a lot of things, including handling tabs, extensions, and other features. It's known to interact with the registry for settings, load various DLLs for functionality, and perform DNS queries as part of web browsing.\n\nThe first six events are just setting registry values. That's normal because Chrome might be adjusting settings or preferences during its operation. The Dns query event is also normal; it could be resolving a domain name for a website being accessed.\n\nThe two Image loaded events are interesting because they're loading specific DLLs into memory. Amsi.dll is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is part of Windows Defender. MpOAV.dll is from Microsoft's Defender as well, handling malicious software detection. So, Chrome loading these might be accessing some APIs or services.\n\nBut wait, why would Chrome load Defender-related DLLs? That seems a bit unusual. Normally, Chrome wouldn't need to directly interact with Defender's components unless there's an extension or feature that interfaces with it. Or maybe it's part of the normal operation for security features within Chrome itself.\n\nI should also consider if these actions could be indicative of malicious behavior. But given that all events are from the same process and the tasks involved are standard operations (registry writes, image loading, DNS queries), there doesn't seem to be a red flag here.\n\nIs there anything else? There's a consistent pattern where most events are registry writes and a couple of others. No unusual files being accessed beyond Defender-related DLLs, which aren't inherently suspicious on their own.\n\nConsidering confidence, I think the batch isn't showing signs of malicious activity. The combination of normal Chrome operations with legitimate system libraries doesn't raise any alarms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal registry modifications and file loading by chrome.exe, which are typical activities for a web browser process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
