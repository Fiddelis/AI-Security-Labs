{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where different processes like 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' are accessing the registry (RegistryEvent). PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated registry access could be concerning. Also, 'wmic.exe' being used with commands to delete processes ('notepad.exe') might indicate potential malicious activity, as WMI can be a vector for attacks.\n\nAdditionally, some events show image loading from system32 files like urlmon.dll, which are legitimate but often targeted by malware. The use of 'whoami.exe' is another red flag because it's commonly used to check user privileges and could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThere are multiple entries where the same processes repeatedly access the registry or load images, suggesting possible persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network. The combination of these activities across different processes and command lines raises suspicion about potential malicious behavior, such as credential dumping, process injection, or persistence setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications by various processes, including PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe, along with deletion attempts of Notepad.exe via WMIC, suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or process termination to cover tracks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and svchost.exe. The tasks involved include things like Registry value sets, Process accesses, Image loads, and Process Creates.\n\nI know that many of these processes can be legitimate but might also be used maliciously. For example, powershell.exe is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement because it's commonly allowed and can execute scripts or commands without being easily detected. Similarly, cmd.exe is a common tool for executing commands, so if there are multiple instances with unusual command lines, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines:\n\n- There are several powershell.exe entries without specific commands, which is a bit concerning because they might be using PowerShell without any obvious malicious activity logged.\n- The schtasks.exe entries are trying to delete tasks with 'schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f'. This seems like an attempt to remove scheduled tasks. If this task was created by malware, deleting it could be an effort to clean up traces.\n- There's a cmd.exe command that tries to copy sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe, which might indicate replacing system binaries. That's a red flag because malicious actors often replace legitimate files with their own to maintain persistence or hide their activities.\n\nOther events include registry modifications, which can be part of installing malware or making persistent changes. The use of whoami.exe could be for gathering information about the current user or system details, which is common in recon or lateral movement phases.\n\nConsidering the frequency: there are multiple entries from different processes with various tasks and commands, especially cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used in succession. This pattern could indicate a sequence of malicious activities, such as dropping files, creating scheduled tasks, and then deleting them to erase evidence.\n\nPutting it all together, these actions don't look like normal user behavior. They involve potentially harmful command executions, file replacements, registry modifications, and task deletionsâ€”all common tactics in cyberattacks. The combination suggests a possible attack chain, making this batch of logs definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, deletion of system tasks, and potential file replacements, which are indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event involves cmd.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because cmd is often used for administrative tasks, and modifying the registry isn't unusual. Next, there are several chrome.exe events where it loads system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These look standard since those are legitimate Windows components.\n\nThen I see conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is typically related to console hosting, so again, this might be part of normal operations. Powershell.exe appears multiple times with various tasks: accessing processes, creating new instances, loading images, and even creating a file in the Temp directory. The command lines for powershell vary; one has an ampersand and curly braces which could indicate script execution, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThere are multiple whoami.exe executions, which is a common tool for checking user information. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own. The repeated use of Registry value set tasks by different processes like cmd.exe and powershell might be worth looking into, but again, these could be legitimate configurations.\n\nI'm noticing that many events involve loading system files or creating temporary scripts, which are common actions for powershell scripts. Without evidence of unusual file paths or attempts to access restricted areas, it's hard to flag this as malicious. The creation of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory is something that could be part of legitimate script execution, especially if the user is running some automated tasks.\n\nOverall, while there are several red flags like multiple powershell executions and registry modifications, each event on its own doesn't indicate malicious activity. It's possible that a user or script is performing routine system checks or updates. However, the frequency and variety of these events might warrant closer monitoring to ensure none are part of a larger attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of log events does not exhibit clear indicators of malicious activity based on the provided information. While there are multiple instances of processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe performing actions such as registry modifications and file creations, these activities align with common legitimate operations. The repetitive use of powershell.exe for various tasks, including script execution, could be part of routine system administration or user activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events appear to be non-malicious. While monitoring for unusual patterns is advisable, there's insufficient evidence at this stage to classify the activities as suspicious."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process deleting a file. The file path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. That looks suspicious because scripts in temporary directories can be malicious. So that catches my attention.\n\nThen there are several events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle' with command lines calling powershell.exe with some if statements checking for batch files. These might be part of a script's initialization, but it's a bit odd to see multiple such events. It could indicate repeated checks or maybe something trying to ensure certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nNext, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in its data directory. That seems normal if it's just the tool running and logging, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother event is about a pipe being created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which could be legitimate or part of malicious activity to hide commands.\n\nThere's also an image load event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems unusual because I don't recall PowerShell typically loading that specific DLL unless it's trying to mimic legitimate behavior or load something malicious that hides under antivirus scrutiny.\n\nAnother file creation by powershell.exe in a user profile's PowerShell StartupProfileData, which could be storing configuration or scripts run during startup. If this is part of a script execution, it might be suspicious depending on the content.\n\nThere are events where both powershell.exe and conhost.exe set registry values. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so that's another red flag.\n\nProcess access events by powershell.exe could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process being created. That might be used to check user permissions or identity, which in some cases is part of malicious activities to gather information.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some of these PowerShell instances, they have long paths with escaped characters and multiple checks for batch files across different directories. This could indicate a script trying to execute if certain files exist, possibly as part of payload delivery or ensuring it can proceed only under specific conditions. The repetitive use of 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks might be an attempt to stay persistent or to avoid detection by timing operations.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell events with file deletions and creations, registry modifications, process accesses, pipe creations, and repeated checks for batch files across various directories. These activities could be indicative of a script trying to establish persistence, possibly downloading malicious content, or attempting to execute code while avoiding detection.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' is involved in some of these events. If this user is a regular user on the system, such activity might not be expected unless they're running administrative scripts. Otherwise, it could suggest unauthorized access.\n\nI'm leaning towards considering this batch as potentially malicious because of the combination of actions: file deletions and creations in temporary directories, registry modifications, repeated script checks that could indicate payload delivery or persistence mechanisms. The use of pipes and process accesses adds to the suspicion as these can be used for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nTherefore, I think this batch is interesting enough for further investigation, especially focusing on the PowerShell activities and the associated file operations.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe analysis of the event logs reveals several concerning activities that suggest potential malicious behavior. Key points include:\n\n1. **File Deletion by PowerShell**: A script was deleted from a temporary directory, which could indicate an attempt to remove traces or prevent detection.\n\n2. **Multiple Provider Lifecycle Events**: Repeated calls to powershell.exe with conditional checks for batch files across various directories may signify persistence mechanisms or payload delivery attempts.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Both PowerShell and conhost.exe modified registry values, which can be a tactic for establishing persistence or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**: The creation of named pipes could be used for inter-process communication, potentially to hide commands or exfiltrate data.\n\n5. **DLL Loading**: Powershell loaded MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory, an unusual action that might mask malicious activities under antivirus scrutiny.\n\n6. **Whoami Execution**: This could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering, common in early stages of an attack.\n\n7. **File Creation in Startup Profile**: Storing scripts here could allow execution on startup, a method for persistence.\n\nGiven these factors, the batch exhibits behaviors consistent with potential malware activity, including persistence, file manipulation, and process injection. Further investigation is warranted to assess the nature of these activities and mitigate any risks. \n\n**Conclusion: The events are deemed suspicious and merit further cybersecurity investigation.**"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm supposed to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. All right, so the user provided a JSONL with multiple entries. Each line is a JSON object representing some log event.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first entry mentions 'powershell.exe' being executed with a command line that checks if a specific path exists and exits accordingly. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, any unusual activity here could be red flags.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where the task is 'Process accessed' for powershell.exe. Accessing processes can be part of normal operations, but when combined with other actions, it might indicate something more. Then, several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading different DLLs. This seems a bit concerning because attackers sometimes load malicious libraries or bypass certain security measures by dynamically loading code.\n\nLooking further, there are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events for temporary files like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1'. Temporary script files created and immediately deleted could be an attempt to avoid detection. Also, the script path in the first event is checking if a batch file exists. That might be part of a larger script or payload deployment.\n\nThen, there's 'chrome.exe' making multiple registry changes. While Chrome can modify the registry for settings, too many changes without a clear reason might indicate tampering, especially if other processes are involved.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events from powershell.exe, which is interesting because pipes can be used for communication between processes. This could be part of normal operation but also a way to hide malicious activities by blending in with legitimate traffic.\n\nThe later entries show more PowerShell instances being launched with similar command lines, each checking different paths and creating temporary files. This repetition might suggest an automated or batch process running multiple times, possibly testing for specific file existence across various locations.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are:\n- Multiple PowerShell executions with conditional checks on file existence.\n- Temporary script creation and deletion.\n-DLLs loaded from .NET framework and Defender components.\n-Registry modifications by Chrome in large numbers.\n-Pipe creations in PowerShell.\n-Repeated similar processes with different paths.\n\nI'm thinking about what each of these could mean. The file checks might be part of a persistence mechanism or attempting to deploy malicious scripts only if certain conditions are met. Temporary files being created and deleted quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection by security tools that look for static filenames or long-lived files.\n\nThe use of pipes in PowerShell could facilitate communication between different processes, perhaps allowing for command execution or data transfer between malicious components. The repeated commands suggest a possible script running multiple instances, maybe testing across different directories or attempting to bypass file restrictions.\n\nNow, considering the context of these events, is there anything that stands out as particularly concerning? Well, the combination of PowerShell usage with conditional checks on files and temporary script creation is a classic tactic for attackers. They often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious commands in a way that's harder to detect because it blends in with normal traffic.\n\nThe file existence checks might be part of a larger payload delivery system. If one file exists, the script exits; if not, it proceeds to drop or execute another file. This is a common method for ensuring persistence or avoiding detection by checking if a specific marker file is present before executing malicious code.\n\nAnother point is that the temporary files are named in a way that's somewhat generic but with random-looking names. This could help them avoid being flagged by certain antivirus products that look for known malicious filenames.\n\nThe registry modifications by Chrome might not be directly malicious, but their frequency and whether they're legitimate updates would need to be verified. If an attacker is using compromised credentials or another vector, they might modify the registry to achieve persistence or change system configurations.\n\nIn summary, while individually these actions could be part of normal operations, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated use of PowerShell with conditional file checks and temporary script filesâ€”is concerning. It's possible that this activity is part of a larger attack campaign attempting to establish a foothold on the system, download additional payloads, or facilitate data exfiltration.\n\nTherefore, I would assess that these logs are indeed interesting for further investigation. They could indicate malicious activities such as scripting attacks, persistence mechanisms, and potential backdoor installations. To confirm this, it's essential to look into each process in detail, check the file paths against known indicators of compromise, analyze the scripts' content (if possible), review the registry changes made by Chrome, and ensure that all updates are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits concerning activity indicative of potential malicious behavior. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:** Repeated invocations of `powershell.exe` with conditional checks on file existence suggest possible attempts to execute additional scripts or payloads, a common tactic in attacks.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion:** The creation and immediate deletion of temporary script files (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) may indicate efforts to avoid detection by removing traces of malicious activity.\n\n3. **DLL Loadings:** Powershell loading various DLLs could signal an attempt to bypass security measures or execute malicious code dynamically, a technique used in attacks.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by Chrome:** While some registry changes are normal, the frequency and context suggest potential tampering, possibly related to persistence mechanisms.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation Events:** The use of pipes in PowerShell can facilitate communication between processes, which might be part of a malicious command chain or data transfer.\n\n6. **Repeated Similar Processes:** The repetition of similar commands across different paths suggests an automated or batch process, potentially testing system vulnerabilities or deploying payloads conditionally.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese logs are significant for investigation as they may indicate scripting attacks, persistence mechanisms, and potential backdoor installations. Further analysis is recommended to verify the legitimacy of each activity, examine script content, review registry changes, and ensure all updates are authorized. This assessment underscores the need for a thorough security audit to mitigate potential threats."}

This seems suspicious because creating files in various locations could be part of malicious activity, like dropping payloads or establishing persistence.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events from different DLLs within the .NET framework and Windows assemblies. While these are legitimate system components, the volume and combination might indicate that PowerShell is executing code that's loading multiple modules, which could be a red flag for a script trying to hide its activities or load malicious components.\n\nThe command lines in some processes show the creation of batch files with commands like \"dir\". This might seem innocuous at first glance, but when combined with the other events, it raises questions. Creating multiple batch files across various directories could be part of file distribution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script file in the user's temporary directory. This is concerning because it suggests that a script is being generated and saved locally, which could be a precursor to executing malicious code.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments, coupled with file creation and registry modifications, indicates potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm looking at multiple events from a single batch. The first thing that stands out is the extensive use of PowerShell.exe across almost all entries. That's a red flag because attackers often abuse legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there are several File Create and Registry value set tasks. Creating files and modifying registry settings can be part of setting up persistence or dropping malicious scripts. The paths mentioned, such as 'C:\\\\modulo_secundario\\\\unidade_secundario\\\\..\\\\elemento_comum\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat', seem like they're trying to create or access specific files in unusual locations.\n\nThe command lines show complex PowerShell commands executing scripts and checking for existing files. This behavior is often used by attackers to ensure their malicious code isn't already present before deploying it, which could indicate an attempt at persistence or avoiding detection.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs. While this is normal for PowerShell operations, the specific DLLs like MpClient.dll and others might be loaded for malicious purposes, such as bypassing security measures or loading additional modules.\n\nThe involvement of conhost.exe in one event adds more suspicion. Conhost.exe is sometimes used by attackers to interact with console applications, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nConsidering the combination of repeated PowerShell use, file creation, registry modifications, and the specific script paths, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. However, without additional context like timestamps or user information, it's hard to be certain. Still, the volume and nature of these events suggest they're worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe activities including file creation, registry modifications, and loading various DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are from PowerShell executions. Each event shows that PowerShell was run with specific command lines checking for file paths and exiting based on whether those files exist. For example, one line checks if \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral..\\elemento_auxiliar\\Componente_secundario_script.bat\" exists and exits 0 or 1 accordingly.\n\nI notice multiple instances where the same pattern repeatsâ€”PowerShell is being used with conditional exit codes based on file existence. This seems repetitive, so maybe it's part of a script checking several files across different directories.\n\nThere are also events related to file creation and deletion in temporary folders, like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\". PowerShell created and then deleted a script test file. This could be normal scripting behavior or something more nefarious, but without seeing the content of those scripts, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the use of different tasks in WinLog, such as Image loaded, File Create, Registry value set, etc. The fact that PowerShell is accessing various system components might indicate legitimate script execution, perhaps for administration tasks or automated processes.\n\nHowever, the repetitive checks and deletions could be part of an attempt to clean up traces after malicious activities. But since all these events are logged as part of normal operations (like file creation and registry changes), it's not clear if they're malicious.\n\nI also see that one event involves \"whoami.exe,\" which is often used to check user permissions or system information. This could be part of a script testing user privileges.\n\nGiven that most actions seem related to PowerShell scripting, file checks, and legitimate system interactions, I'm leaning towards this batch not being particularly suspicious.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are related to powershell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. Malware tends to use it for command and control or executing payloads.\n\nLooking closer, I see several ImageLoad tasks, which means the process is loading various DLLs. This in itself isn't suspicious unless they're known malicious ones, but combined with other behaviors, it might raise an eyebrow. There are also FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events where a PowerShell script is being created and then deleted shortly after. That's odd because why create and delete a file quickly? Maybe to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the Registry value set tasks. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, which is something attackers use to keep their malicious processes running after a reboot. If there were multiple writes without reads or legitimate reasons, it could be concerning.\n\nThere are also ProcessCreate events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe with specific command lines. The whoami.exe might just be checking the user context, but the cmd.exe command seems to check if a file exists in a temp directory. That's interesting because it could indicate a presence check for another file, possibly part of a payload delivery.\n\nI notice that some events have complex command lines using Test-Path to check for specific files and exit codes based on their existence. This behavior suggests the script is probing the system for certain binaries. If these paths are non-standard or if the binaries don't exist legitimately, it could be an attempt to verify if a malicious payload is present.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple similar processes with slightly different command lines also stands out. It might indicate testing across different locations or attempts to evade detection by varying parameters.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or additional event types (e.g., network connections), it's hard to say definitively. But the combination of file system interactions, registry modifications, and multiple process creations with potentially malicious intent is enough to raise concerns.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because these behaviors collectively suggest possible malicious activity, even if individually they might not be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, possibly indicating malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is PowerShell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The tasks mentioned include 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. These could indicate legitimate activity or something malicious, like script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are two instances where cmd.exe was used to access the registry, which might be normal admin work but could also hint at privilege escalation or configuration changes. The use of whoami.exe a couple times is another red flag because it's commonly used by attackers to check permissions and identities.\n\nLooking closer, several PowerShell executions have command lines that include conditional checks using Test-Path. This seems unusual because such scripts typically don't exit based on file existence unless they're trying to avoid detection or execute only under certain conditions. The paths mentioned in these commands point to .cs files across various directories, which could be part of a larger script or payload.\n\nThe repetition of similar command-line arguments with varying paths makes me think this activity is systematic and possibly automated. This behavior doesn't align with typical user actions, suggesting it might be part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) campaign or a script testing multiple targets.\n\nWhile some events could be legitimate admin tasks, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated PowerShell executions with conditional logic and varied pathsâ€”raises concerns about potential malicious activity.

Let's go through each one.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loaded an image. That's standard, as PowerShell loads DLLs regularly. Next, it created a file in the Temp directory and then deleted it. Hmm, creating and deleting temporary files can be part of legitimate processes, but sometimes attackers use this to clean up traces.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing different paths via Test-Path commands. These look like checks to see if certain scripts exist. The repeated use of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in these checks stands out. That script name sounds malicious, often used for keylogging or stealing information.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe execution.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit new to analyzing system logs for malicious behavior, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nSo, the user provided a batch of events in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe accessed something related to process access.\n2. **Events 2-6**: These are all about Image Load events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs. The paths look like standard system files, so that seems normal.\n3. **Event 7**: Powershell.exe loaded MpOAV.dll which is part of Windows Defender. That's expected behavior when using Defender-related features.\n4. **Events 8-9**: Powershell created and then deleted a temporary file in the user's AppData folder. This might be suspicious because it's creating and immediately deleting a script, possibly to avoid detection.\n5. **Event 10-11**: These are engine lifecycle events with command lines checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. The paths mentioned seem legitimate, but I'm not entirely sure if this is normal behavior or part of some malicious activity.\n6. **Event 12**: winlogbeat.exe created a file in its data directory, which seems fine since it's likely part of log management software.\n7. **Events 13-14**: Powershell accessed files related to startup profiles and modified the registry. Registry modifications can be both legitimate (e.g., setting preferences) or malicious (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n8. **Event 15**: whoami.exe was executed without any suspicious command line arguments, which is a common tool for checking user information.\n9. **Events 16-20**: Powershell accessed processes multiple times, not unusual on its own. Calculator and svchost events seem benign, loading standard system DLLs.\n\nPutting this together: The batch shows a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is often used by attackers for command execution and script downloads. Notably, the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (events 8-9) could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace. Additionally, the repeated registry modifications might be part of creating persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations in a way that's not easily reversible.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this is normal administrative activity, especially if someone is using powershell for scripting and configuration tasks. The use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 isn't inherently malicious unless the script has known malicious functions.\n\nI should also consider the frequency and context. If these events are happening in a short span without any prior indicators, it might raise more flags. But with limited data, it's hard to tell definitively.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting due to the suspicious file creation\/deletion and potential registry tampering. There's enough red flag behavior to warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"interesting\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events show powershell.exe creating and deleting a temporary script, which may indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's directory. That seems normal as it's likely part of the log collection process.\n\nNext are multiple entries from powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. But individually, these might not be suspicious yet.\n\nI notice several events where whoami.exe was executed. This tool usually returns system information, which can be benign or part of privilege escalation in attacks. The command line seems standard, but repeated use could warrant closer look.\n\nThen there's a lot of network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making DNS queries and establishing connections is normal for browsing. However, the number of connections might indicate something unusual, like a botnet activity or a malicious extension.\n\nThe later events show powershell.exe accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. This is concerning because attackers often manipulate the registry to maintain persistence. The command line in one event includes some powershell commands that look like they're querying directories recursively, which could be part of data collection or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell processes with suspicious activities, including registry modifications and image loads, along with repeated network connections from chrome.exe, might indicate a potential attack. The use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion. While some events are common, the combination suggests possible malicious behavior that's worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple powershell.exe processes accessing registry values and loading various DLLs, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a system. The goal is to determine if the entire collection should be looked into for potential malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it can be tricky. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event is about a file creation by powershell.exe. The path seems temporary, which isn't unusual since PowerShell often creates temp files. But then the next event shows that same file being deleted. That's a bit odd because if the script didn't finish or had an error, it might not delete properly. However, sometimes scripts do clean up after themselves.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is running commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are directory listing commands, which could be part of a script trying to gather information about the system. But these commands alone aren't malicious; they're commonly used in scripts for legitimate purposes.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe loads a DLL from Windows Defender. That seems normal since PowerShell might interact with system components, and Defender is a trusted process. However, if that path had been suspicious or led to an unexpected location, it would raise flags.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation of files in different locations, like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt'. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but the naming and content could be suspicious. Without knowing more about the file's contents, it's hard to say, but I don't see anything red flag here yet.\n\nI also notice events involving 'winlogbeat.exe', which is likely an ELK stack component used for log shipping. Its actions are creating files in its data directory, which is standard behavior and not concerning unless there's something wrong with the logs it's processing.\n\nThere are a couple of registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, but they're also common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. Without seeing what exactly was modified, it's hard to assess the risk here. However, since these events are paired with other actions, I need to consider if there's a pattern.\n\nThe process access event by powershell.exe could be an indicator of lateral movement or privilege escalation, but again, without context on which processes were accessed and for what purpose, it's difficult to determine malicious intent.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple PowerShell instances running similar commands, creating and deleting files, accessing the registry, and interacting with various system components. While some actions are concerning in isolation (like file creation\/deletion patterns), others are normal. The frequency of these events might be a factorâ€”if this level of activity is unusual for the user or system, it could warrant closer investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there's a combination of activities that could indicate either normal script execution or potential malicious behavior. However, without more context or specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), the confidence isn't extremely high. There are enough red flags to merit attention but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell.exe creating and deleting files, accessing the registry, and running commands that could indicate malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
