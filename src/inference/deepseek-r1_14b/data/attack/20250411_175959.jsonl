Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. These seem normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity as part of its operation. No red flags there.\n\nThen, the logs switch to powershell.exe. The command line shows a script that runs several commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember -group Users, cmdkey.exe \/list, and some directory listings. These commands can be legitimate but might also indicate malicious activity like gathering user info or system details.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses the registry, loads images, creates a file in the Temp folder, deletes it immediately, and several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script could be part of obfuscation tactics to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious commands and the handling of files suggests possible malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be abused in attacks. The command lines show activities like user enumeration (`net user`), checking local groups, and listing directories. This kind of activity could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement, which are red flags.\n\nThere's a process where `powershell.exe` is executing a script that includes commands like `cmdkey.exe \/list`, which retrieves cached credentials. That’s concerning because it can be used to gather sensitive information for privilege escalation.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with the 'user' command, which again relates to user account management. This could be part of an attack chain aimed at understanding the environment or creating new accounts.\n\nI also see several events from `chrome.exe` modifying registry values. While this might seem normal for browser updates, the frequency here is seven instances, which seems excessive. Could it be a sign of malicious activity attempting to persistence?\n\nAdditionally, there are logs showing file creations by `powershell.exe`, such as `pacote_ativo.txt`. The naming doesn't raise immediate red flags, but combined with other activities, it might indicate data exfiltration or writing malicious scripts.\n\nThere's an event where `updater.exe` is running with a specific command line. While legitimate updates are normal, the parameters and paths should be verified to ensure they're not part of a payload delivery mechanism.\n\nFinally, there are multiple entries related to security groups and user account management without any associated process or file context. This could indicate an attacker attempting to manipulate permissions or group memberships.\n\nPutting it all together, these logs show a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain: initial access via PowerShell, privilege escalation using `cmdkey.exe`, lateral movement through directory listings, and potential data handling. The combination suggests possible malicious intent rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as PowerShell command execution with suspicious commands, file creation by PowerShell, net.exe and cmdkey.exe usage for user enumeration, repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, and security group management without clear context. These activities suggest possible unauthorized access or reconnaissance.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLet me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening here.\n\nThe first few entries look like they're from the same process or similar activities. They all have \"winlog\" tasks related to \"Security Group Management\". That seems a bit generic, maybe just group policy updates or user management actions. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are events involving different processes:\n- One event shows \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading some DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. I'm not familiar with SDXHelper.exe off the top of my head, but it might be a legitimate system utility or part of some software.\n- Next, I see net.exe and powershell.exe being executed with commands related to local group management. Using net.exe for localgroup is common in admin tasks, so that's probably normal unless there are unusual command lines or repeated attempts.\n- Another event has \"net1.exe\" which isn't a standard Windows executable. That might be something to look into—maybe it's a typo or a malicious variant of net.exe?\n- Powershell.exe is involved in creating files and modifying registry values. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes, so I need to check if the commands are legitimate admin tasks or if they're doing something nefarious.\n- There's an entry with \"conhost.exe\" which usually runs PowerShell in console mode, but again, it depends on how it's being used here.\n- The winlogbeat.exe is creating a YAML file. That sounds like part of a log management system, maybe Elasticsearch or similar. If this process is allowed and running as expected, that's normal.\n- MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is involved in updating Edge, which is a standard update process, so that's likely okay unless there are issues with the installation source.\n- There's also \"backgroundTaskHost.exe\" loading urlmon.dll. That seems related to background processes or task scheduling.\n\nLooking at all these together, I notice a lot of legitimate system activities: process creations, file operations, registry changes, and updates. The net1.exe is a red flag because it's not a standard command, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe for creating files and modifying registries could be concerning if those actions are unexpected in this environment.\n\nHowever, since most of these events seem like routine operations—processes loading DLLs, system updates, log file creations—it might not indicate any malicious activity. Unless there's an unusual spike in activity or attempts to access restricted areas, which I don't see here.\n\nSo considering the entire batch, while there are a few points that need attention (like net1.exe and some powershell activities), they might be within normal operational parameters, especially if the environment is known for running administrative scripts and updates frequently.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly routine system activities such as process creations, file operations, and registry changes. While some events like the use of net1.exe could be suspicious, there's insufficient evidence to suggest malicious behavior in this context.\"\n}\n```"}
