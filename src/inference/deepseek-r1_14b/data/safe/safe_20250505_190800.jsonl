{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this JSONL data to determine if the batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving \"powershell.exe\". PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The events show that powershell.exe was created with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". Using Bypass to ignore execution policies can be a red flag as it's commonly used to run malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where files were created or deleted by PowerShell. For example, it created a file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1\" in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted it. This kind of behavior can be indicative of script testing or attempts to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the loading of various DLLs through ImageLoad events. While some are legitimate, others like \"mscoree.dll\" and \"mscorlib.ni.dll\" could be part of obfuscation techniques used by malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. This seems normal unless it's part of an attempt to cover tracks or create decoy logs, which isn't clear here.\n\nThe combination of these events makes me suspicious because the actions taken by PowerShell could be part of a malicious script execution process, including attempts to bypass security policies and potentially execute harmful commands.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with potential signs of malicious activity such as file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and image loading.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing I notice is that the same process name, powershell.exe, appears in all these logs. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities. \n\nLooking closer, there are several ImageLoad events where powershell.exe is loading different DLL files, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These might be legitimate parts of .NET framework operations, but sometimes attackers use these modules to execute malicious code or bypass detection.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. The fact that this file is created and then deleted shortly after (as seen in the FileDeleteDetected event) could indicate an attempt to avoid persistence or remove evidence of the script's execution. Malware often deletes its traces quickly.\n\nAnother interesting point is the Registry value set event. This suggests that something is modifying the system registry, which can be a sign of configuration changes made by malware to maintain persistence across reboots or disable security features.\n\nFinally, there's an Execute a Remote Command event with no file path, which could mean that powershell.exe was used to run a command over the network, possibly exfiltrating data or executing malicious commands on another system.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated use of powershell.exe, creation and deletion of a script in Temp, registry modifications, and remote command execution. These indicators collectively suggest potential malicious activity, especially since such actions are often part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe loading various DLLs, creating\/deleting a script in the Temp directory, modifying the registry, and executing a remote command.
