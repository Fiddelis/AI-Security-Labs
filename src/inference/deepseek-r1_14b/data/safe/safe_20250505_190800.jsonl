{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from different processes. The first few logs show actions like file creation and registry changes from mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE. That's normal because these are system processes that might be updating settings or files regularly. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I notice a lot of events related to powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be a vector for attacks. The logs show ImageLoad tasks which mean powershell is loading certain DLLs. Some of these DLL paths are standard .NET and Windows system files, so that seems okay. However, there's one event where it loads MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal if it's part of the system's legitimate operation, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. Then immediately after, there's a FileDeleteDetected event. That could mean that the file was created and then deleted quickly, which might be part of testing or malicious activity trying to clean up traces.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one powershell.exe is running with \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". The ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a red flag because it's often used in attacks to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked. Also, executing a script from the same directory (.\\) might indicate that the script isn't part of a trusted location.\n\nThere are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for powershell.exe, which could mean it's starting up or tearing down but not necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of \"teste.ps1\" in the Downloads folder. Creating files here can be normal, but combined with the script execution via powershell with Bypass, it raises concern about potential malicious scripts being run without proper permissions.\n\nI'm also noticing that winlogbeat.exe is creating a .winlogbeat.yml.new file twice. That might just be log shipping or configuration updates, which doesn't seem suspicious unless there's more context.\n\nConsidering all these events together, especially the powershell execution with Bypass and the quick creation\/deletion of scripts, it seems like there could be malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell and the way files are handled might indicate an attack vector. However, without seeing the content ofteste.ps1 or other indicators of compromise, I'm not entirely certain but leaning towards interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show ExecutionPolicy Bypass and file operations that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. All the events are from powershell.exe processes. The tasks include things like ImageLoad, FileCreate, and Registry value set.\n\nThe first few entries show powershell loading various .NET framework files, which is normal because PowerShell often uses these for execution. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a PS1 script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. That looks suspicious because temporary scripts can be part of malicious activities.\n\nBut then that same file gets deleted right after it was created. This quick creation and deletion might indicate an attempt to bypass script analysis by the system, which is a common tactic in malware. The next FileCreate event points to a StartupProfileData file under Microsoft Windows PowerShell, which could be for legitimate use but seems unusual when combined with other events.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set, which is concerning because attackers often modify registry settings to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. Lastly, an event for Execute a Remote Command stands outâ€”it suggests that the script might be executing commands over the network, potentially leading to lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file operations in Temp, quick creation\/deletion of a script, registry modifications, and remote command execution. These behaviors are red flags for potential malicious activity. The sequence seems too deliberate and points towards possible exploit attempts or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in Temp, registry modifications, and remote command execution, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
