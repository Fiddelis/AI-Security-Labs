{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nThe first two entries are about Microsoft Edge updates creating files and changing their creation times. That seems normal because software updates do create temporary files and adjust timestamps during installations. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving CompatTelRunner.exe loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows processes related to compatibility and antivirus features, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThen I see setup.exe creating a pipe. Pipes in Windows can be part of normal operations, especially during software installations. Since this is tied to Microsoft Edge's setup, it's probably just part of the update process.\n\nThe services.exe and special logon events are standard for service processes starting up and user logons. They're pretty common and not indicative of malicious activity unless there's unusual timing or multiple failed attempts, which isn't the case here.\n\nThere are several User Account Management tasks logged. These usually happen during account creation, deletion, or changes. If these were happening outside business hours or in bulk, they'd be more concerning, but individually, they're normal.\n\nLooking further down, I see taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is expected since Task Scheduler uses this DLL to manage scheduled tasks. The svchost.exe events with registry value changes are also standard for various Windows services managing their configurations.\n\nThe powershell.exe command catches my attention. It's being run with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and a specific command that checks for .inf files related to installation data. This could be part of a legitimate script, but I need to consider the context. If this is executed without proper authorization or if it's scanning for unexpected files, it might indicate malicious activity. However, the presence of such commands alone isn't enough unless they're used inappropriately.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe is normal browser behavior when navigating to websites, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file is expected if that's a monitoring tool running on the system. It's part of log shipping and not indicative of anything malicious.\n\nLastly, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds odd because why would Calculator need DNS-related functions? However, since it's a simple process, sometimes legitimate apps load various DLLs for different functionalities. Without more context, this might just be normal behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, most events are standard system operations related to updates, service management, and user activity. The only potential red flag is the powershell.exe command scanning for .inf files. However, without additional context like unusual permissions or multiple such commands, it's hard to classify this batch as suspicious. Therefore, I would lean towards classifying it as NOT INTERESTING because there's no strong evidence of malicious behavior across these logs.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: NOT INTERESTING**\n\nThe analysis of the provided system log events reveals that most activities are within the bounds of normal system operations, including software updates, service management, and user account tasks. While the use of PowerShell to scan for specific files could potentially be concerning, there is insufficient evidence to suggest malicious intent without additional context. Therefore, this batch of logs does not present a significant security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Normal Activities:** Software updates, service processes, log file creation, and legitimate tool operations.\n- **Potential Concerns:** PowerShell script execution; however, no clear indicators of malicious behavior are identified.\n\nThis classification suggests that the events do not warrant immediate attention from cybersecurity personnel."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a batch of JSONL events, each representing some system activity. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings. Next, MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll – that's related to Task Scheduler, which should be standard Windows behavior.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup for log management, so it's normal for it to create configuration files.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll again – that's another instance but still within expected operations.\n\n_svchost.exe_ creating some state and cache files under NetworkService. That's typical for Windows services using Delivery Optimization, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating a file in the Edge update directory – normal activity during updates or checks.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender components – that's expected since it's part of Windows Defender operations.\n\nThere's an event where MicrosoftEdgeUpdate deletes a temp file. That seems okay as part of cleanup after download.\n\nAnother MpCmdRun creating a lock file – again, standard for processes managing state.\n\nThen there are some events from conhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. Conhost is usually used by command-line tools, and mintty is often related to Cygwin or MSYS environments. They might be setting some environment variables or configurations, which isn't inherently malicious.\n\nGit.exe creating several files in a node_modules directory – this looks like development activity, perhaps someone cloning a repo or running npm commands that generate these files.\n\nPutting it all together, none of the events stand out as malicious or unusual. Most are standard operations by legitimate processes doing their jobs: Chrome, Windows services, antivirus, log management tools, and development software. The only thing to maybe look at is whether some activities coincide or if there's an unusual combination, but individually they don't raise red flags.\n\nI'm not seeing any signs of exploit attempts, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. All the file creations, deletions, and registry changes are within expected baselines for these processes. Therefore, the batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation beyond normal monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire event log does not appear to contain any suspicious or malicious activity. Each process is performing standard operations as part of their intended functionality. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event 1:** chrome.exe sets a registry value – normal for Chrome configuration.\n2. **Event 2:** MsMpEng.exe loads taskschd.dll – expected Task Scheduler interaction.\n3. **Event 3:** winlogbeat.exe creates a file – standard log management activity.\n4. **Events 4-5:** CompatTelRunner and svchost create\/update files related to Windows services, normal for updates\/caching.\n5. **Event 6:** MicrosoftEdgeUpdate creates an update file – typical Edge update behavior.\n6. **Events 7-9:** MpCmdRun interacts with Defender components and creates lock files – standard antivirus operations.\n7. **Event 10:** MicrosoftEdgeUpdate deletes a temp file – normal cleanup post-update.\n8. **Events 11-13:** conhost.exe, mintty.exe set registry values – likely related to CLI tools or development environments.\n9. **Events 14-21:** git.exe creates multiple files in node_modules – typical during npm operations or development activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNo evidence of malicious activity detected in the log. All events are within expected behavior for legitimate processes."}

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a Windows system. Each line has details about the process involved, the Windows log task, and some file information.\n\nLooking at these events, they all have \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"}, which means the Git executable is the process running. The \"winlog\" field consistently says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The files being created are located under paths like \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\\" and various subdirectories within them.\n\nHmm, so I'm noticing that all these events are related to the creation of files during a Git operation, probably when someone is cloning or initializing a repository. The node_modules directory suggests this might be part of a Node.js project setup. Files like package.json, index.js, and others are typical in such contexts—they're standard for npm packages.\n\nSince each event just reports a file being created by Git, there's nothing unusual here. No signs of access to sensitive files, privilege escalations, or other red flags that would indicate malicious activity. It looks entirely normal for someone working with version control and Node.js projects.\n\nI don't see any anomalies like unexpected file paths, multiple failed attempts, or activities outside regular user behavior. All the events are sequential and consistent with standard Git operations during project setup.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs don't raise any red flags. They're just part of a user's routine work with their codebase using Git and Node.js.

The files being created are in a Node.js project structure under node_modules, which suggests someone is working on a JavaScript project. These include package.json, README.md, LICENSE, and other standard files for npm packages.\n\nThe paths like \".github\/FUNDING.yml\" and \"CHANGELOG.md\" also fit the typical setup of an open-source project using Git. The modules being created, such as \"side-channel\", \"signal-exit\", and \"slice-ansi\", are all known npm packages used for various utilities in Node.js development.\n\nSince these events show multiple file creations related to a software project's dependencies, it looks like someone is installing or cloning the repository. This activity is common during development and doesn't indicate any malicious behavior. There are no signs of unusual processes, access from unknown sources, or attempts to modify sensitive files.\n\nTherefore, this batch likely represents normal development work rather than anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a user performing Git operations and creating standard Node.js project files.

Each line is a separate event, and they all seem to be file creation events triggered by the git.exe process. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst off, every single event has \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\" which tells me that Git is the one performing these actions. The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", so it's about files being made. The file paths all point to different locations within a node_modules directory for various packages like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, and others.\n\nI remember that when you clone a Git repository or set up dependencies with npm, Git can create these files as part of the checkout process or installing modules. Node modules are standard in JavaScript projects; they contain all the packages and their associated files. So seeing multiple files being created here seems normal during development or setup.\n\nThe paths look legitimate. They're under a user's Downloads folder within an \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\" directory, which sounds like a course or project related to software quality. This context makes me think it's part of someone's study materials or a development environment they're setting up.\n\nI don't see any unusual file names or paths that stand out as malicious. All the files are standard for node_modules—package.json, index.js, readme.md, license files, and documentation. There's no executable outside the norm or anything suggesting command-line attacks or hidden processes.\n\nThe consistency in events is also a point to note. Each event follows the same structure, which aligns with Git operations. If there were irregularities like varying file types or locations, that might raise an eyebrow, but here everything seems consistent with typical development activities.\n\nConsidering the user's context—probably a student working on software quality—it makes sense they're setting up these modules for their project. There’s no indication of unauthorized access or malicious intent; it looks like routine setup.\n\nI should also think about whether Git itself is commonly used in attacks, but I don't recall that being a primary vector. Most security issues with Git are more around misconfiguration or exposure of sensitive data, not direct file creation events from the executable itself as part of normal operations.\n\nSo putting this all together, these events don't raise any red flags. They fit the pattern of someone using Git and npm to set up their development environment. No signs of intrusions, unusual files, or suspicious activities. Therefore, I wouldn't consider this batch as interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal file creation operations by the Git process during the setup of node_modules for a software project.

Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nAll the events are JSON objects with similar structures. Each has a \"process\" field indicating that git.exe is running. The \"winlog\" shows that a file was created, following a specific rule called FileCreate. The \"file\" path varies but seems to be part of a directory structure related to node_modules and includes files like index.js, license, package.json, and readme.md.\n\nHmm, so the user is working on a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". They're using Git, which makes sense for version control. The file paths are all under node_modules, which means they're related to Node.js packages. For example, strip-json-comments, supports-color, tcomb-validation, and tcomb are all npm package names.\n\nI remember that when you install Node.js packages, especially with npm, the system creates several files in the node_modules directory—like package.json for each module, index.js as an entry point, license files, and READMEs. So these events are likely part of installing or updating dependencies during a development workflow.\n\nSince all the processes are initiated by git.exe, maybe the user is cloning a repository that includes these Node modules, or perhaps they're running some scripts that involve npm. The repeated FileCreate events under node_modules suggest a normal installation process rather than anything malicious.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. There's no indication of failed processes, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute unknown code. All the files are standard for Node.js packages.

The winlog task mentions \"File created\" each time, so these are all about files being created. The file paths all point to various .js and .d.ts files inside the node_modules directory for a package called tcomb.\n\nHmm, node_modules is where Node.js packages are stored. Since the process is git.exe, it's likely that Git is cloning or pulling a repository, which would involve creating these files as part of the download or checkout process. The multiple file creation events suggest that Git is extracting these files from the repository into the local node_modules directory.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. All the files are standard parts of a Node.js package, and the repeated file creations by Git indicate normal operation during a fetch or install. There's no evidence of access to sensitive files, failed login attempts, or anything that would raise a red flag in terms of security.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events are just part of a regular software development workflow—cloning a repository and installing dependencies.

All these events are in JSONL format, each being one line with a JSON object. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's from git.exe and mentions that a file was created under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\dect.js. The same pattern continues with several other files being created by git.exe in the same directory but different filenames, like enums.js, extend.js, etc.\n\nHmm, so each event is a file creation by git.exe in a node_modules folder. Node modules are standard for JavaScript projects using npm, especially when dealing with packages like tcomb which I recall is a type checker. Git.exe creating files sounds normal because during development, cloning or pulling repositories would involve creating new files or directories.\n\nI should consider the context of these events. If git.exe is performing normal operations like syncing or updating dependencies, then these file creations are expected. There's no indication here of anything unusual—like multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or inconsistencies in timestamps that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nAlso, all files being created are within a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages. The paths don't point to system binaries or sensitive data; they're purely related to the project's source code and dependencies.\n\nSince all events are similar and fall under expected behavior when managing a Node.js project with git and npm, there doesn't seem to be any red flags. No signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or other indicators of compromise are present in these logs.\n\nTherefore, I don't think this batch is interesting for further investigation.

Let me go through them one by one to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has the same \"process\" field: {\"name\":\"git.exe\"}. That tells me that whatever is happening here is related to the Git version control system. So maybe someone is using Git for some kind of development or file management.\n\nNext, looking at the \"winlog\" part, all these events have the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means each event is indicating that a new file was created. That's not unusual on its own, but when you see multiple such events in a row, it might be something to look into.\n\nNow, examining the \"file\" field, each has a \"path\" that starts with \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\tcomb\\\\\". The rest of the path varies with different filenames ending in .js or .d.ts. For example, one file is \"isMaybe.js\", another is \"isObject.js\", and so on.\n\nPutting it all together, this seems to be a series of file creation events within a Node.js module called 'tcomb'. The fact that they're all being created by Git.exe suggests that perhaps someone is cloning or pulling a repository, which includes these files. Alternatively, maybe they're extracting a tarball or running some build process.\n\nI need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Since all events are related to the same user (fiddelis), in the same directory, and involve standard file creation during what appears to be a Git operation, it doesn't raise any red flags. These activities are typical when someone is working with code repositories or setting up development environments.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's anything unusual about creating multiple files at once. While Git can create many files in a single operation (like pulling from a branch), sometimes attackers might try to hide malicious activity by blending it with normal behavior. But in this case, all the file paths are within expected project directories and the filenames are standard for a Node.js module.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or malicious intent here. The files being created are part of 'tcomb', which is a known library for type checking in JavaScript. So unless there's some additional context indicating that this user shouldn't be accessing these files, or if the creation times seem suspicious, it doesn't seem concerning.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this batch isn't particularly interesting from a security standpoint. It appears to be normal development activity related to Git and Node.js.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by 'git.exe' within a standard development directory structure, indicating normal software development or repository management operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
