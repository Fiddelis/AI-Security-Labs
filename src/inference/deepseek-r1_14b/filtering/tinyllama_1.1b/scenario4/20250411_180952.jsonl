I've got a list of logs here, each with process info, winlog task, and sometimes file info.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's svchost.exe doing a DNS query. Svchost is a common system process, so that's not unusual. DNS queries are standard for network activities, so probably Not Interesting.\n\nNext up, three events from chrome.exe with network connections detected. Chrome is known to make frequent network calls, especially when browsing the web. So, these seem normal and should be Not Interesting.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process being created. Whoami is a system tool used to display user information. Unless it's being abused, this isn't suspicious on its own. Maybe Not Interesting unless context says otherwise.\n\nMoving on, I see several powershell.exe entries. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also common in attacks. However, without specific malicious indicators like certain commands or scripts, these could just be normal usage. The first one accessing a process might not raise flags yet. A later event shows powershell setting registry values. That's more concerning because attackers often modify the registry to persistence. So this might be Interesting.\n\nLooking further, there are cmd.exe and net.exe processes creating users and adding them to Domain Admins group. This is definitely a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts without proper authorization could indicate privilege escalation or account creation for malicious purposes. Also, using command-line parameters like '\/add \/domain' suggests an attempt to add these accounts across the domain. Definitely Interesting.\n\nAnother cmd.exe setting registry values again raises suspicion because modifying system settings can be part of persistence mechanisms or enabling further attacks.\n\nConhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files are less concerning. Conhost is a host process for console apps, which is normal. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack tool, so file creation here seems legitimate unless it's misused, but without more context, probably Not Interesting.\n\nLastly, svchost creating SRUtmp.log againâ€”since svchost is system-related and this log is part of the system's resource usage tracking, it's normal. So Not Interesting.\n\nPutting it all together: the cmd.exe and net.exe activities for adding users to Domain Admins are definitely suspicious. The powershell registry changes also stand out as potential malicious activity. The rest seem like standard operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": {\n    \"Interesting\": [\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"cmd.exe\", \"command_line\": \"\\\"cmd.exe\\\" \/c net user \\\"pacote_principal_Admin\\\" \\\"registro_temporario_pass123!\\\" \/add \/domain & net group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" \\\"elemento_comum_Admin\\\" \/add \/domain\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"net.exe\", \"command_line\": \"net  user \\\"pacote_principal_Admin\\\" \\\"elemento_ativo_pass123!\\\" \/add \/domain \"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"net1.exe\", \"command_line\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1  user \\\"unidade_comum_Admin\\\" \\\"unidade_temporario_pass123!\\\" \/add \/domain \"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"net.exe\", \"command_line\": \"net  group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" \\\"modulo_comum_Admin\\\" \/add \/domain\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"net1.exe\", \"command_line\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1  group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" \\\"modulo_comum_Admin\\\" \/add \/domain\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"powershell.exe -Command New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\\\... -Name \\\"ImagePath\\\" -Value \\\"cmd.exe\\\"\",\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Not Interesting\": [\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"svchost.exe\", \"command_line\": \"svchost.exe\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"DNS query\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"chrome.exe\", \"command_line\": \"chrome.exe\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Network connection detected\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"whoami.exe\", \"command_line\": \"whoami.exe\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"powershell.exe -Command Get-Process\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Process access\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"svchost.exe\", \"command_line\": \"svchost.exe\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Create file\"},\n        \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\sru\\\\SRUtmp.log\"}\n      },\n      {\n        \"event\": {\"process\": {\"name\": \"powershell.exe\", \"command_line\": \"powershell.exe -Command Remove-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\\\... -Name \\\"ImagePath\\\"\"},\n        \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set\"},\n        \"file\": null\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"}
