{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: It's MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. That sounds normal because Defender services often monitor network activities. Not too worried about that.\n\nNext, several chrome.exe entries with Network connection detected. Chrome does connect to the internet regularly for browsing, so these might just be regular web traffic. But I'll keep an eye out if there's something unusual here later.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of chrome.exe also having Network connection detected events. Same as above, probably normal unless they're connecting to suspicious IPs.\n\nLooking further down, powershell.exe is setting a registry value. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad. Setting registry values isn't inherently malicious, but it's something to note because attackers often use PS for command-line tasks.\n\nThe cmd.exe entry catches my attention. The command line looks like this: \"cmd.exe \/c net user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" \/add \/domain & net group \"Domain Admins\" \"elemento_comum_Admin\" \/add \/domain\". That's creating a new user in the domain and adding them to the Domain Admins group. Creating users via command line isn't uncommon, but creating a domain admin account could be significant if this is an automated script or part of someone's legitimate work.\n\nThen there's net.exe being used with a similar command: \"net  group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" \\\"modulo_comum_Admin\\\" \/add \/domain\". Adding another user to the Domain Admins group. This seems like it's related to the previous cmd command, perhaps setting up multiple admin accounts.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event setting a registry value. Maybe related configuration changes.\n\nConhost.exe is next, also setting a registry value. Conhost is often used for running scripts or commands, so again, not sure if this is part of normal operations or something else.\n\nPowershell.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_base.txt. Creating files with PS can be normal, but the path and filename don't immediately ring bells as malicious. Still, it's worth noting.\n\nTwo events from svchost.exe about creating SRUtmp.log in system32\\sru. Svchost is a common service host process, so this could be part of normal Windows operations or something else. The file name seems standard, but it's always good to check if it's unexpected.\n\nAnother powershell.exe setting a registry value again.\n\nPutting this all together: There are several instances where processes like cmd and net are being used to create domain users and add them to the Domain Admins group. Creating multiple admin accounts is a red flag because attackers often escalate privileges by adding new admins. Also, using command-line tools like cmd.exe and net.exe for such tasks could be part of lateral movement or setting up persistence.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe for registry changes and file creation adds to the suspicion, especially if these actions aren't aligned with normal user behavior. The repeated commands suggest an automated process, which might indicate script executionâ€”potentially malicious scripts.\n\nMpDefenderCoreService and chrome activities seem benign, but the other events are more concerning. The combination of creating multiple domain admin accounts and using tools that can execute commands remotely makes this batch interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of cmd.exe and net.exe being used to create new domain users and add them to the Domain Admins group, which may indicate unauthorized privilege escalation. Additionally, powershell.exe is used to set registry values and create files, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
