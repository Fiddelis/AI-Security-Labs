{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. I need to look at all the events together and see if there's any malicious behavior going on.\n\nLet me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from notepad.exe setting a registry value. Notepad is a common application, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own. Then there are several powershell.exe entries with tasks like Process accessed and Registry events. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. \n\nI notice multiple instances where svchost.exe sets registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so again, not inherently bad, but unusual activity from it could be concerning. There's also Calculator.exe doing the same thing, which might be more suspicious because it's an innocent app.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe being used with commands like deleting processes (notepad.exe) and scheduled tasks. That's interesting because cmd can execute system commands, and deleting processes or tasks could be part of malicious activity. The command lines show specific operations that might be trying to remove traces or disable security features.\n\nWMIC.exe is also appearing here, which I know can be used for remote commands and is often flagged in security contexts. The command line shows it trying to delete notepad.exe as a process, which could be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThere are multiple registry events from various processes, especially chrome.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications are common but can also indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used to delete a scheduled task. This is another tool that's legitimate but could be part of an attacker's toolkit for removing evidence.\n\nI also see whoami.exe being run, which usually just reports user information but in the wrong context can be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows a sequence of activities that seem to involve process creation, deletion of processes and tasks, registry modifications, and use of tools like powershell and cmd with specific commands. These actions could be indicative of someone trying to clean up after an attack, remove security tools (like Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll), or establish persistence.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially malicious commands is a red flag. Also, the deletion of processes and scheduled tasks without clear justification might suggest an attacker trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of these events shows signs of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as process deletions, registry modifications, and use of tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe with potentially malicious commands. These activities may indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable security features.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's look through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe and chrome.exe are setting registry values. That seems normal because these are common processes that might interact with the registry for configuration. But then, I notice several powershell.exe entries doing similar things, like setting registry values and accessing processes. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for attacks because it has so many capabilities.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe deletes a file in the Temp directory with a specific path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. That filename looks suspicious because it includes \"_PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might indicate some kind of script testing or policy-related activity, but the fact that it's being deleted could mean it was created and executed earlier, potentially as part of malicious activities.\n\nThere are also several events where powershell.exe is launching with command lines that seem to be checking for the existence of certain batch files. For example: {if (Test-Path \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}. This kind of check could be part of a larger script to determine if specific files exist, which might be indicative of an attacker checking for previous malicious scripts or ensuring conditions before executing something.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing various system components and DLLs, like mscoreei.dll and mspaint.exe. While these can be legitimate, the combination with other suspicious activities raises a red flag.\n\nThe use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe isn't inherently bad, but when combined with powershell activity, it could be part of an attack chain where attackers escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nMoreover, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new config file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this might not be suspicious on its own unless it's being misused.\n\nThe high number of powershell events with varied tasks and the specific filenames involved make me think that this could be part of a larger attack or persistence mechanism. Attackers often use multiple techniques to stay undetected and ensure their scripts run properly, so checking for file existence and deleting temporary files could be steps in such an attack.\n\nIn summary, while some events might look normal at first glance, the combination of powershell activities, including potential file deletions and checks for malicious scripts, raises concerns about possible malicious intent. The repeated attempts to access specific paths and the deletion of a temp script file are particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Powershell Activities**: Multiple powershell.exe instances perform actions such as setting registry values, accessing processes, and interacting with system components. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes due to its extensive capabilities.\n\n2. **File Deletion**: An event shows powershell.exe deleting a file in the Temp directory named _PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The filename suggests it might have been created and executed as part of a script, potentially malicious.\n\n3. **Command-Line Checks**: Powershell is used to check for specific batch files (e.g., objeto_ativo_script.bat). Such checks could be part of an attack chain to ensure conditions before executing malicious code.\n\n4. **Suspicious Access**: The access to various system components and DLLs by powershell.exe, combined with other activities, raises concern about potential exploitation.\n\n5. **Command-Line Use**: The use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe, while not inherently suspicious, in combination with powershell activity, could be part of an attack chain for privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nIn conclusion, the batch of events is deemed interesting due to the concerning combination of activities involving powershell, file deletions, and checks for malicious scripts. These actions suggest potential malicious intent, making this batch worthy of further investigation."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and then see how they might connect.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. That's not inherently bad, but it's something to keep an eye on because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in these events are a bit complex. For example, the first event has a command line that checks if a specific .bat file exists; if it does, it exits with 0, else 1. That seems like it's testing for the presence of another script or file.\n\nLooking at the other powershell.exe events, there are several ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs and MS Core libraries, which is normal for PowerShell execution. There are also FileCreate and RegistryEvent tasks, which might indicate that the script is creating files or modifying registry entries—common actions during setup or configuration, but could be malicious too.\n\nThen there's a series of events from chrome.exe making changes to the registry. That seems odd because Chrome typically doesn't make such frequent registry modifications unless it's part of an update or some extension activity. But four separate RegistryEvent tasks from chrome.exe might not be suspicious on their own; maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines that seem to interact with .bat files in specific directories like \"modulo_logico\" and \"registro_geral\". The fact that these commands are checking for or creating scripts suggests that something might be trying to execute other scripts, which could be part of a larger process. If these .bat files aren't supposed to exist or if their content is unexpected, this could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the creation of new files in user-specific directories like \"AppData\" and \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". Creating files in these areas could allow an attacker to maintain persistence or execute code at startup. The use of \"-Force\" in the New-Item command indicates that it's trying to create the file even if it already exists, which might be a way to overwrite existing scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where different .bat files are being checked or created across various directories. This could indicate that an attacker is attempting to spread malicious scripts across the system or ensure persistence by checking multiple locations for their presence.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events aren't necessarily suspicious, the pattern of repeated PowerShell commands creating and checking for script files in different locations, combined with registry modifications from chrome.exe, raises some red flags. It could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, but given the complexity and specific paths involved, there's a possibility of malicious intent.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities align with user behavior or known processes on the system. If this level of activity isn't typical for the user or if it's occurring outside normal working hours, that adds to the suspicion. Without more context, though, it's hard to be certain.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive evidence of malicious activity, there are enough indicators to warrant closer investigation. Further analysis would involve checking the actual content of the created files, verifying if these scripts are authorized, and looking into the source or reason behind the repeated attempts to create and check for these .bat files.\n<\/think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the system logs, the batch of events exhibits several characteristics that merit attention from a cybersecurity standpoint. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe Activities**:\n   - Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with complex command lines suggest potential script interaction. These scripts are checking for or creating .bat files in specific directories, which could be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities.\n   - The use of commands like `Test-Path` and `New-Item` indicates file system interactions, possibly to execute other scripts or modify the environment.\n\n2. **File and Registry Operations**:\n   - Creation of new files in user-specific directories (e.g., \"AppData\") and registry modifications might be attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.\n   - The use of `-Force` in `New-Item` suggests an attempt to overwrite existing files, which could be a tactic to ensure script execution.\n\n3. **Chrome.exe Registry Modifications**:\n   - Unusual frequency of registry changes from chrome.exe may warrant further investigation, though it might also be part of legitimate updates or extension activities.\n\n4. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The repetition of file creation and checking across various directories could indicate an attempt to spread malicious scripts or ensure persistence across the system.\n\n5. **Context Consideration**:\n   - Without additional context, such as user behavior patterns or timing, it's challenging to confirm malicious intent. However, the complexity and specific nature of these activities raise concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**: While not definitive proof of malicious activity, the observed patterns are indicative enough to warrant further investigation. This should include checking script contents, verifying authorization, and assessing whether these actions align with normal system operations. Proactive measures such as monitoring for similar activities and reviewing file integrity could help mitigate potential risks."}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most events are related to PowerShell executions. There are multiple entries with command lines that create or set content in .bat files. That seems suspicious because creating scripts can be part of malicious activities like setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe tasks in the logs vary between Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, File created, Process accessed, Image loaded, and Pipe Created. The fact that several events are about file creation and process access points to potential file handling or script execution.\n\nLooking at the command lines more closely, they involve creating new items (New-Item) with -Force and then setting content to \"dir\". Creating files in various directories could be an attempt to plant scripts across multiple locations, possibly for persistence or to spread malicious activities. The repetitive pattern of these commands suggests automated behavior, which is often seen in attacks.\n\nSome events show tests for existing files using Test-Path, exiting with 0 or 1 based on the result. This might indicate a check if certain binaries exist before proceeding with more malicious actions, which is a common step in attack chains.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe accessed the registry and another where winlogbeat.exe created a file. While these could be legitimate, especially winlogbeat being an ELK tool, the combination with other events might raise suspicion. However, without seeing other malicious indicators from winlogbeat, it's less concerning.\n\nThe high number of PowerShell executions in various command lines is a red flag. Malware often uses PowerShell for execution because it's a built-in tool and can execute commands that are hard to detect. The creation of multiple .bat files could be part of a larger script that the attacker is setting up, perhaps to run at startup or during system boot.\n\nThe justification leans towards interesting because of the repeated use of PowerShell with file creation and access patterns, which aligns with common attack behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances creating and accessing files across various directories, potentially indicating malicious script deployment or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

This is a common technique in scripting to check file presence. However, when combined with other activities, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events loading .NET framework DLLs and Windows Defender components. While this is normal for PowerShell execution, the combination with registry access could be concerning. Specifically, there's a Registry value set event in powershell.exe, which might suggest attempts to modify system configurations or hide processes.\n\nAdditionally, there are process creations for whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe command uses IF EXIST to check for a file and exit accordingly. This seems like part of a script checking file existence but could be used maliciously to determine if certain files are present before proceeding with more nefarious activities.\n\nThe repeated checks on different paths (like C:\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_ativo\\entrada_padrao\\bin\\registro_geral.exe and others) across multiple events might indicate an attempt to verify the presence of specific binaries, possibly to ensure they're not being monitored or have been altered. This kind of behavior is often seen in malware during a kill switch check or to locate tools for further execution.\n\nFurthermore, the creation of temporary PowerShell script files (__PSScriptPolicyTest...) suggests that scripts are being executed, which could be part of malicious activity trying to bypass certain security policies by testing if scripts are allowed to run.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple file existence checks, registry modifications, and temporary file creations—it seems like there's a pattern of behavior that might indicate a potential security threat. The events aren't overtly malicious on their own but collectively could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with checks for specific files, registry modifications, and creation of temporary files, which may indicate malicious activity or script execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from powershell.exe. That's not unusual on its own since PowerShell is commonly used both by admins and attackers. But the specific tasks logged are things like file deletes, pipe creations, registry changes, and process accesses. The command lines in some events have these long paths with conditions checking for files, which seems a bit odd.\n\nLooking closer at the command_line entries, they all have similar structures: checking if a certain .cs or .ps1 file exists in various directories. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\estrutura_temporario\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\tarefa_base\\\\src\\\\elemento_base.cs\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This pattern repeats multiple times with different paths and filenames. It makes me think that the script is trying to verify if specific files exist in different locations.\n\nThen there are file creation events, like creating __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 in a temporary directory and immediately deleting it. Creating a file just to delete it could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to test write permissions.\n\nThe registry value sets and process accesses might indicate that the script is attempting to interact with system components, possibly looking for other processes or modifying system settings. The image loads are standard for PowerShell scripts, but it's worth noting which DLLs are being loaded—things like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll are typical for .NET runtime.\n\nAnother event involves whoami.exe being executed. That tool is often used to check user privileges, so that might be a sign of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file checks across different paths could indicate a script attempting to locate specific files as part of its operation. The creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts suggest an attempt to execute something potentially malicious but then remove evidence quickly. The whoami.exe execution adds to the concern as it's commonly used in attacks for reconnaissance.\n\nWhile individually these events might not raise too many flags, the combination—especially the repeated checks across various directories and file operations—suggests a possible adversary attempting to establish persistence or gather information on the system. It's also possible that this is part of an automated process, but given the nature of checking multiple paths and using PowerShell, it leans more towards malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude these events are worth investigating further to determine if they're indicative of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits characteristics that may indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated file checks by powershell.exe across various directories, coupled with the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, suggest an attempt to establish persistence or gather information. Additionally, the use of whoami.exe for privilege checking adds to this concern. While individually these activities might not be alarming, their collective nature raises suspicions of a security incident.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are deemed interesting for investigation due to suspicious patterns indicating possible malicious activity, including repeated file checks, temporary script creation\/deletion, and privilege checks. Further analysis is recommended to assess potential threats.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting for further investigation}}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several events related to `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The logs show that powershell.exe was accessed multiple times with different tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Process accessed', and even file operations like creating and deleting a script file in the Temp directory. This could be suspicious because creating and then deleting a script might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\nNext, there are events from `whoami.exe`. While whoami is typically used to display user information, its presence multiple times could warrant attention if not explained by normal usage. However, in this case, it's just being executed without any unusual command-line arguments, so maybe it's part of a legitimate process or script.\n\nLooking at `svchost.exe`, which is a common system process that can be used maliciously because it's often associated with services. The fact that svchost.exe accessed registry values multiple times might not be suspicious on its own since many services do this. But combined with other events, it could contribute to the overall risk.\n\nThe `chrome.exe` entries show network connections being detected. While browsing can generate many such events, a high number or unusual patterns might indicate something fishy, like data exfiltration. However, in this case, there are multiple instances but nothing seems out of place for regular web activity.\n\nThere's also an entry from `winlogbeat.exe`, which is likely part of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) used for log management. It's creating a configuration file, which is normal behavior and probably not indicative of malicious activity.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple powershell.exe accesses with different tasks, including file operations in Temp directory; repeated network connections from chrome.exe but nothing unusual there; whoami and svchost executions without clear signs of tampering. The creation and deletion of the PowerShell script file might be a red flag for potential malicious activity attempting to erase evidence.\n\nHowever, I'm not seeing other strong indicators like known malicious process trees or multiple failed attempts that would definitely classify this as suspicious. It could also be a legitimate admin task using powershell.exe extensively, which is common in enterprise environments.\n\nGiven the mix of normal and potentially concerning activities, but without clear signs of compromise or attack, I'm leaning towards this batch being not particularly interesting for investigation. The confidence level isn't very high because there are elements that raise eyebrows but aren't conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"detection\": {\n    \"summary\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity, especially the creation and deletion of a script file in the Temp directory.
