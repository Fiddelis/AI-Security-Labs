{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm seeing multiple events from powershell.exe instances, which is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines look suspicious because they're setting up scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. That's unusual because calc.exe isn't typically used in such scripts—it might be part of a persistence mechanism or to drop further payloads.\n\nLooking at the WinLog events, there are several registry writes and process accesses, which could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or gather information. The file events show temporary files being created and then deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by cleaning up traces.\n\nAdditionally, there's a series of \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no associated processes or files. This suggests potential remote execution activities that might not be captured in the provided logs, possibly indicating command-and-control communication or lateral movement within the network.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities—setting up high-privilege tasks, modifying system settings, creating and deleting temporary files, and executing remote commands—raise red flags for potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple PowerShell processes creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges, file creation and deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, and several 'Execute a Remote Command' events.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst event: It's a process with powershell.exe executing some command line that looks like creating a scheduled task. The task action is calc.exe at logon as Administrators, run level highest. That seems suspicious because it's using powershell to create a persistent task with high privileges. Could be a way to maintain access or execute malicious code on next logon.\n\nSecond event: Execute a Remote Command task. Not sure what triggered this yet, but remote commands can be risky if not authorized.\n\nThird and fourth events: Powershell creating files in the StartupProfileData directory. That's non-interactive, so maybe some script running on startup? Also, setting registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nFifth event: conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is usually associated with command-line tools; seeing it modifying registry might indicate something malicious, especially if done by another process earlier.\n\nSixth to eighth events: Chrome.exe doing various things—file creations and registry sets. But wait, chrome shouldn't be creating files or making many registry changes. Unless there's some extension or exploit, this could be odd. Also, loading amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, which seems normal, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context...\n\nNinth event: winlogbeat.exe creating files; that's the ELK stack tool for log management. It might be setting up its configuration or data collection.\n\nTenth and eleventh events repeat similar actions as above, so nothing new there.\n\nTwelfth event again: powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt in downloads. That seems odd—why would powershell create files in user's download folder? Maybe exfiltration or storing malicious content.\n\nPutting it all together: Powershell is being used to create scheduled tasks with high privileges, which could be for persistence. There are multiple registry modifications from different processes, including conhost and chrome, which might indicate some kind of payload deployment or lateral movement. The creation of files by powershell in a user's download folder could be storing data, perhaps malicious scripts or tools.\n\nThe combination suggests possible unauthorized access, backdooring with scheduled tasks, and potential data exfiltration or malicious file storage. These activities don't seem normal for everyday operations and could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, registry modifications, and file creation in user directories, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
