{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from winlogbeat.exe. It starts with a Process Create event when it's launched, then creates several files in the logs directory. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely setting up its logging files. There's also an attempt to write a .yml file, which could be configuration changes.\n\nThen, there are several events from powershell.exe. It accesses processes and loads various DLLs, which isn't unusual since PowerShell often uses these libraries. However, it creates a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1, then deletes it shortly after. That might be suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection, especially if the script is malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are Image Load events from powershell.exe pointing to different system32 and .NET framework paths. These could be normal operations, but sometimes attackers use legitimate processes like PowerShell to execute malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also an ipconfig.exe process created with the command line showing \"\/all\", which is a standard way to view detailed network configuration information. That seems benign unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at all events together, the creation and deletion of the temporary PowerShell script file stands out as potentially malicious activity. The other events are mostly normal operations for these processes, but the quick creation and deletion of that specific file might indicate an attempt to execute something without leaving evidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch includes notable activities such as a PowerShell process creating and deleting a temp script file, which could be malicious behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A PowerShell instance created and then deleted a temporary script file, potentially indicating suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
