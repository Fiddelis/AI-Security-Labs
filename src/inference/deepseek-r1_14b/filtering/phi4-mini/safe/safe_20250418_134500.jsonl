{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several process creations from svchost.exe and chrome.exe. Svchost is a common system process, so that's not unusual. Chrome is also a legitimate application, so its activity doesn't raise red flags on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple network connection events related to chrome.exe. While browsing the web does involve network connections, the frequency here might be worth noting, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nI notice that some files are being created in Windows Update logs and another file related to winlogbeat.yml.new. These seem like normal system operations or log management, which don't indicate malicious activity on their own.\n\nThere are several registry value sets from chrome.exe and msedge.exe. Browsers often interact with the registry for settings, so this isn't concerning unless specific keys are modified.\n\nDns queries from chrome.exe could be part of normal browsing behavior, like resolving domains. Without unusual domain names or repeated failed queries, there's no immediate cause for alarm.\n\nLastly, the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe processes loading images and a DLL file also seem within the expected bounds for browser updates and functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, while each event on its own isn't suspicious, there doesn't appear to be any combination of events that indicate malicious behavior. The activities are consistent with normal system operations and legitimate application behaviors. Therefore, this batch doesn't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal process creations, network connections, file creation in Windows Update logs, registry changes from Chrome and Edge, and DNS queries, all of which are typical user activity and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is about a file being created in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. That seems normal because Windows Update generates logs regularly. \n\nNext, there are multiple entries involving MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe. These include process access, network connection detection, and termination events. Edge updates often run in the background, so these activities are typical during an update.\n\nI also see a PowerShell process being accessed. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, on its own, accessing it isn't suspicious unless there's unusual command-line activity. Here, there's no command line provided, so I don't have enough info to suspect anything wrong.\n\nThere's another event about Registry value set by RuntimeBroker.exe. That sounds normal since many system processes interact with the registry.\n\nThen, several events are from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely an agent used for log management. It creates files and logs, which is standard behavior for such tools. \n\nA file creation by svchost.exe in a DeliveryOptimization Cache directory doesn't raise flags. Svchost is a common system process, and cache activities are normal.\n\nNotepad being launched without any unusual command-line parameters isn't concerning. Users often open Notepad for various legitimate reasons.\n\nThe next event involves MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deleting a file in the Temp directory. This seems part of the update process to clean up old files, so it's expected behavior.\n\nThere are several FileCreate events and changes in file creation times related to Edge updates. These activities align with typical software installation and update processes.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's no pattern indicating malicious activity. Each event falls within normal system operations, especially related to Windows Update and Microsoft Edge updates. Without signs of unauthorized access, unusual process behaviors, or unexpected file modifications, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard Windows update and system processes activities such as file creations, registry changes, and process terminations, which are normal operations. There is no indication of malicious or unusual behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
