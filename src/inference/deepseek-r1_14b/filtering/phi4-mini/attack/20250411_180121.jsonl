{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. These seem pretty standard for a browser process, so nothing too suspicious there on their own.\n\nThen I notice events involving powershell.exe. The command line shows that it's downloading files from various GitHub repositories. The URLs are pointing to different paths under raw.githubusercontent.com. This could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when downloading files from external sources.\n\nLooking closer, each download is saving the file to the TEMP directory with names like modulo_padrao.txt and tarefa_auxiliar.txt. These filenames don't immediately seem suspicious, but combined with the fact that they're being downloaded via WebClient, it raises concerns about potential script execution or malware deployment.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted shortly after. The file creation in the TEMP directory and subsequent deletion might be an attempt to remove traces, which is a common tactic in malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also a process access event and registry modifications, which could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms. These actions can allow malware to survive reboots or maintain access.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from external repositories, creating temporary files, deleting them after some time, and making changes to the system—it's highly indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The combination suggests a possible script execution or download of malicious payloads, which makes this batch quite concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from external repositories and executing commands, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I've got a batch of system logs in JSONL format, and my job is to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The user wants just one classification—either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING—and some justification along with a confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each event individually to spot any patterns or anomalies. There are 24 events here, so that's manageable.\n\nLooking at the first three events:\n1. Process: chrome.exe, Task: Registry value set.\n2. Same as above.\n3. Same again.\n\nSo, Chrome is making several registry changes. That seems a bit odd because I know Chrome doesn't typically make a lot of registry modifications. Usually, those are red flags for malware or persistence mechanisms. But maybe it's legitimate? Or could this be a sign of something else?\n\nNext event: powershell.exe loading a file from C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... That path seems okay because Windows Defender is a legitimate process. So that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command line that has \"DownloadFile\" pointing to a GitHub URL. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt, and the file is being saved to %TEMP%\\tarefa_ativo.txt. Hmm, downloading files from random GitHub repos could be risky because it's an easy way for attackers to drop malicious payloads. But sometimes legitimate scripts do this too.\n\nLooking at another event: powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That's under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell. I'm not sure if that's standard or not, but saving files there might be for persistence or configuration purposes.\n\nThen there are several events of winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory. Winlogbeat is an ELK stack tool used for log shipping. If it's creating new config files, maybe during setup or updates? But the path seems okay.\n\nAnother PowerShell file creation event saving to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt. Not sure what that contains, but again, could be legitimate or part of a script.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, and Calculator.exe are accessing or modifying the registry. Svchost.exe is known for being used by various services, so that's common. RuntimeBroker might be related to Windows Store or updates. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems a bit odd because I don't recall Calculator needing URL-related DLLs.\n\nLooking further down, there are cmd.exe processes with commands like SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn. That sounds suspicious. SCHTASKS is used to manage scheduled tasks, and deleting a task named \"spawn\" might indicate that something malicious was trying to remove persistence mechanisms before it gets cleaned up.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe command running without any arguments—it just outputs the user info. Not inherently bad but could be part of some script checking permissions or identity.\n\nPutting all this together: There are multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands, downloading files, and creating files in various locations. The use of cmd.exe to delete a task named \"spawn\" stands out because that's often a sign of malicious activity—maybe cleaning up traces after compromising the system.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications by Chrome, svchost.exe, and others might be part of legitimate operations, but given the other suspicious activities, it raises flags. Additionally, the GitHub download could be downloading something malicious if the file is executed afterward.\n\nAnother point is that several processes are accessing each other—like PowerShell accessing calc.exe or cmd.exe. That can sometimes indicate process injection or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nConsidering all these factors: there's a combination of potentially legitimate activities (like Chrome registry writes, winlogbeat operations) and clear signs of possible malicious behavior (GitHub download, deleting scheduled tasks, odd process access). The overall pattern suggests that the system might have been compromised, with attackers using various tools and techniques to gain persistence and cover their tracks.\n\nI think this batch is definitely worth investigating further. There's enough evidence pointing towards potential unauthorized activities that could indicate a breach or malicious code on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\n**Justification:**\nThe log entries exhibit multiple indicators of potential malicious activity, including suspicious PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub and deleting scheduled tasks, which may be efforts to cover tracks. Additionally, unusual process interactions and registry modifications by various legitimate-looking processes could signal compromise or persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Confidence Score:** 85%\n\nThis confidence score reflects the combination of suspicious activities and potential legitimate operations, with a higher likelihood of malicious intent due to the concerning patterns observed."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving processes like schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and reg.exe. These tools can be legitimate but are often used in malicious activities as well. For example, schtasks.exe is commonly used to create or delete scheduled tasks, which attackers might use to maintain persistence.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line for schtasks.exe: \"\/Delete \/TN spawn \/F\". This means the system deleted a task named \"spawn\". While legitimate admins might do this, it's suspicious if not authorized. Similarly, several cmd.exe commands are deleting registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, specifically removing values like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These registry keys are often used by malware to ensure persistence across reboots, so their deletion could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious software.\n\nThe logs also show multiple powershell.exe instances. Powershell is a powerful tool that can execute scripts and perform various system operations. The repeated use here without clear legitimate context raises flags. Additionally, the command line for one powershell.exe is \"& {}\" which is a common technique used in obfuscation to make the script harder to analyze.\n\nThere are several registry value set events across different processes. This could indicate that multiple components of malware are attempting to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile some entries might be part of legitimate system administration tasks, the combination of deleting scheduled tasks and registry keys, along with extensive powershell usage, suggests potential malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is attempting to remove traces of previously installed malware or setting up a more persistent infection vector.\n\nI also notice multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this can be normal, it might indicate that the script is executing and interacting with system components in ways that could be malicious.\n\nIn summary, while each individual event isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, the pattern of using these tools together—deleting tasks, modifying registry entries, and extensive powershell usage—is concerning. This behavior aligns with tactics used in cyberattacks for persistence and lateral movement. Therefore, I would consider this batch of logs as potentially indicative of malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\n\nThe log events indicate potential malicious activity. The combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying registry entries, and extensive use of powershell.exe—often used in cyberattacks for persistence and obfuscation—suggests suspicious behavior. Further investigation is recommended to determine if unauthorized access or malware is present.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, these logs indicate potential malicious activity and warrant further investigation.}}"}

Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, multiple entries are from powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. The first few logs show ImageLoad and FileCreate tasks. Notably, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension—this is a script that could potentially execute code.\n\nThen, I notice some FileDeleteDetected events for that same temporary PowerShell script. This deletion might be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity after execution, which raises a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are several RegistryEvent tasks involving powershell.exe and other processes like conhost.exe and cmd.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. The repeated ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe and cmd.exe also stand out because attackers often use these tools in command chains.\n\nThe combination of creating, deleting, and registry manipulation related to PowerShell scripts suggests possible malicious activity. These behaviors could indicate script execution attempts, evidence of lateral movement, or setting up persistence. While it's possible some actions are legitimate admin tasks, the frequency and specific file paths make this batch concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, including creation of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory, deletion of that script, and several registry modifications.

PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also commonly exploited by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The presence of multiple ImageLoad tasks suggests that PowerShell is loading various DLLs, which could be normal or could indicate malicious activities like loading malicious scripts or modules.\n\nLooking closer, there are file creation events where temporary files are being created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Specifically, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 is created and then deleted shortly after. Temporary script files can be part of legitimate operations, but the deletion might be an attempt to remove evidence or avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Registry value sets from both PowerShell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome updating its settings isn't unusual, combined with other PowerShell activities, it could indicate configuration changes that might be malicious, such as persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to facilitate unauthorized access.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is executed. This tool is often used to check user privileges and can be part of recon or credential dumping processes in attacks. The command line shows it was run without any arguments, which might not raise a flag on its own but could be part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of the Remove-Item cmdlet in PowerShell to delete files in the TEMP directory. This could be an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity or to remove evidence before it's noticed.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are multiple indicators that could point towards potential malicious behavior. The combination of creating and deleting temporary scripts, modifying registry settings, using whoami.exe for privilege checking, and removing files in the TEMP directory might be part of a script trying to achieve persistence or execute malicious commands.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp folder, registry modifications, and removal of files suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event and seeing what's happening.\n\nFirst, a lot of these are from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note. The command lines show Remove-Item commands in several events. These are deleting files from the TEMP directory. Specifically, they're removing .zip and .txt files, like tarefa_base.zip or estrutura_geral.zip. This could be part of normal script execution, but it might also indicate an attempt to clean up evidence after malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the timestamps would help, but since I don't have them, I'll focus on patterns. There are multiple delete commands targeting different files in TEMP. Also, some events show file creation and deletion of a PowerShell profile data file, which might be part of legitimate script execution but could also suggest persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe was run, which is often used to check user permissions or system information. This alone isn't suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern. However, combined with the other powershell activity, it raises some flags.\n\nAnother point is the use of different command lines for the same operation—like slightly varying file paths being deleted. This might be an attempt to remove multiple related files systematically, possibly leftovers from malicious scripts or tools.\n\nI also see registry access and image loading events in chrome.exe and other processes, which could be normal activity, but paired with powershell's actions, it's something to look into.\n\nOverall, the repetitive use of powershell for file deletions, combined with whoami.exe execution and the specific files being deleted (which might indicate malicious payloads or droppers), suggests this batch is worth investigating. The confidence isn't super high because some activities could be benign, but there are enough red flags to warrant further look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell processes deleting files from the TEMP directory, including zip and txt files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from system logs.\n\nFirst off, I notice that a lot of these events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple events related to file operations—like creating and deleting files in temporary directories—is concerning. For example, the events show files being created under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1, which is unusual. Then those same files are deleted shortly after.\n\nThere's also a pattern where different PowerShell commands are removing files in the TEMP directory. The command lines indicate that they're trying to remove specific text files. This could be an attempt to clean up traces of previous activities, which might be part of an attack chain. Additionally, there are events loading various DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender, which might be normal, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it raises the alarm.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file in the Downloads folder named objeto_padrao.txt. While this could be benign, coupled with all the other activity, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe inclusion of whoami.exe is interesting too. It's typically used to get user information but can also be part of recon during an attack. The fact that it's executed right after some PowerShell activities makes me think there might be a sequence of malicious actions.\n\nThere are also entries from chrome.exe making registry changes, which seems odd because Chrome usually doesn't do that unless there's an extension or something modifying the system beyond normal browsing behavior. This could indicate tampering with system settings, possibly to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nOverall, considering all these events together—use of PowerShell for file operations and deletions, creation of suspicious files in temp directories, execution of whoami.exe, and registry modifications by Chrome—it seems like there's a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity. However, without more context or evidence of actual exploit attempts, it's hard to be certain. The confidence level is moderate because while the signs are worrying, they could also be coincidental or part of legitimate scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directories and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first two events are from `chrome.exe` accessing the registry. Chrome often does this for extensions or settings, so it's probably normal.\n2. Then there's `RuntimeBroker.exe`, which is a known Windows process handling runtimebroker services. Registry access here could be legitimate too.\n3. Next, I see multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being run from the system32 directory. This is a standard tool for getting user info, but running it many times might be suspicious, though not necessarily malicious.\n4. There are several `powershell.exe` events with different tasks: accessing processes and files. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, so repeated access could be a red flag.\n5. Towards the end, there's an event from `winlogbeat.exe`, which is likely part of log management software, creating a file. That seems normal.\n6. Lastly, another PowerShell instance creates a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt'. The filename in Portuguese translates to \"active package,\" which might be related to malicious activities or downloading something.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of legitimate processes but also repeated and unusual activity with PowerShell and whoami.exe. This could indicate potential lateral movement or reconnaissance by an attacker. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm if these actions are truly malicious. \n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities might be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts, despite PowerShell's reputation. The confidence is medium because while some actions raise flags, others don't provide enough evidence for a definitive conclusion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of legitimate processes like Chrome and PowerShell performing normal registry operations and file creations. While the repeated use of whoami.exe might raise some concern, it isn't conclusive evidence of malicious activity without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
