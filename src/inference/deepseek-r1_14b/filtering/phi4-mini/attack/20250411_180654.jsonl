{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell creating a file named objeto_temporario.txt. That's suspicious because scripts often create temp files. Next, there are multiple Chrome.exe entries setting registry values. Registry changes can be indicators, but since it's from Chrome, maybe it's just normal activity like extension settings.\n\nThen, I see whoami.exe being executed. This could be used by attackers to check user privileges, so that stands out as potentially malicious. \n\nLooking further, there are several PowerShell processes with command lines executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts, which suggests they're logging keystrokesâ€”a clear sign of malware trying to capture sensitive information.\n\nMultiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading various DLLs might be normal script execution but could also indicate attempts to hide or obfuscate actions. The repeated calls to the same script paths are concerning as it indicates a consistent attack pattern.\n\nThe FileCreate and subsequent FileDeleteDetected for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 look like they're testing PowerShell's execution policies, which attackers often do before deploying scripts. Additionally, the PipeCreated event might be used for communication between processes, which is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing malicious scripts, registry modifications, checking user info, and obfuscation techniques. This batch shows clear signs of potential malicious activity that could compromise system security.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including repeated execution of PowerShell scripts with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications, file creation and deletion, and process creation events. These activities suggest possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each containing information about processes, windows logs, and files.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe is running a script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) which suggests it's capturing keystrokes. The log path is set to the TEMP directory, so it might be writing logs there. This seems suspicious because keyloggers are often malicious.\n   \n2. **Event 2**: Another instance of powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal; Defender uses these components.\n\n3. **Event 3**: Powershell loads urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL for URL handling. Not suspicious on its own.\n\n4. **Event 4**: File creation by powershell.exe in the user's profile under PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This could be normal if it's part of PowerShell initialization, but given the context, it might relate to storing keystroke data.\n\n5. **Event 5**: Powershell sets a registry value. This is common for scripts to configure settings, but again, in this case, combined with other events, it raises an eyebrow.\n\n6. **Event 6**: Conhost.exe (a console host) setting a registry value. Not sure why conhost would do that, especially since it's often used by malicious scripts to hide their output.\n\n7. **Event 7**: Another powershell.exe running the same Get-Keystrokes script, indicating multiple instances or attempts to run this script.\n\n8. **Event 8**: Execute a Remote Command with a file path pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in a common directory. This could mean someone is trying to execute scripts from shared locations, possibly malicious ones.\n\n9. **Event 9**: Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That seems normal as it's an agent collecting logs.\n\n10. **Events 10, 11, 12, 13**: Various processes (powershell.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe) creating files in different paths. Not immediately suspicious except for the powershell ones which are tied to the keylogger script.\n\nNow, considering all these events together:\n\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing the same keylogger script.\n- The creation of files related to keystroke logging in user directories.\n- Conhost.exe modifying registry values, which is unusual behavior as it's typically just a host for console applications.\n- Execution of scripts from different paths, possibly indicating attempts to hide or spread the malicious activity.\n\nThe repetition and combination of these events suggest that there might be an ongoing malicious process trying to capture keystrokes and potentially exfiltrate data. The involvement of conhost.exe is odd because it's not commonly associated with malicious activities unless being abused.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I think the batch is definitely interesting for investigation. There are several red flags indicating possible malicious activity, especially focusing on powershell.exe and conhost.exe actions that don't align with standard operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of suspicious activities involving PowerShell executing a keylogger script, creation of files related to keystroke logging, and unusual registry modifications by conhost.exe. These events suggest potential malicious behavior targeting system monitoring or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
