The first few entries show Chrome making network connections and DNS queries, which isn't unusual on its own because browsers do that all the time for web browsing.\n\nThen there's a series of PowerShell processes. I notice that PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines that involve encoding plaintext into ciphertext using XOR encryption.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events provided in JSONL format. My job is to determine if this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" based on the potential for malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: This shows a PowerShell process with a specific command line. The command seems to encode some plaintext into ciphertext using XOR encryption and then sends it via an HTTP POST request to example.com. This could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can execute malicious commands. The XOR cipher, while simple, might be an attempt to obscure data being sent out.\n\n2. **Events 2-5**: These are similar to the first event. They repeat the same command line, which suggests that this activity isn't isolated but is happening multiple times. Repeating such network requests could indicate either legitimate repeated tasks or potential malicious behavior trying to bypass detection by spreading out activities.\n\n3. **Event 6**: Again, it's a PowerShell process with the same command. However, the 'winlog' task here mentions \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which might imply some kind of service-related activity. Not sure about this one yet; I'll need to consider more context.\n\n4. **Event 7**: This event is different. It shows a file creation by winlogbeat.exe at a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely related to log management, possibly part of the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). The filename '.winlogbeat.yml.new' suggests it's updating configuration files. This seems legitimate unless there's something unusual about the file path or content.\n\n5. **Event 8**: Another PowerShell process with a command line that creates a file in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. The fact that it's creating a profile data file might be normal, but without more context on what's inside or how it's being used, it's hard to say.\n\n6. **Event 9**: This shows a PowerShell process modifying the registry. Registry changes are common for legitimate software installations, but they can also be part of malicious activities. Without knowing which key or value is being set, it's tricky to assess.\n\nNow, considering all these events together:\n\n- There are multiple instances of PowerShell processes with the same command line. This repetition could indicate a script being run multiple times, possibly as part of a scheduled task or automated process. However, in the context of cybersecurity, repeated attempts to send encoded data over the network can be suspicious.\n  \n- The use of XOR encryption might not necessarily be malicious but is often used by attackers to hide data they don't want to be easily understood. It could be an attempt to exfiltrate data from the system.\n\n- The involvement of multiple processes (winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell) suggests different activities. Winlogbeat handling logs is normal, but the other processes doing network communications might not be.\n\n- No direct evidence of malicious behavior like file creation in restricted areas or deletion of files, but the repeated network activity could be an indicator.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the repetitive and potentially obfuscated network traffic from PowerShell instances stands out. While some events are normal (like log management), others like the registry modification and multiple encoded HTTP requests need closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs should be classified as **INTERESTING** due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Repetitive Suspicious Activity**: Multiple instances of a PowerShell process executing the same command line, which involves encoding data with XOR encryption and sending it via HTTP POST. This repetition raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Obfuscation Techniques**: The use of XOR encryption suggests an attempt to obscure data, commonly used by attackers to hide potentially malicious activities.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: A PowerShell process modifying the registry could indicate either legitimate configuration changes or malicious activity, requiring further investigation.\n\n4. **Network Traffic Concerns**: The encoded HTTP requests from multiple processes are suspicious and warrant closer examination for possible data exfiltration.\n\nWhile some events (like log management by winlogbeat.exe) are normal, the combination of these factors makes this batch of logs notable for potential security issues."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm given a batch of log events from different processes and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and being accessed by other processes. Powershell is commonly used in scripts and can be malicious, so repeated access might be suspicious. Also, there's a process named whoami.exe running, which could be used to gather system info—something attackers often do.\n\nAnother point is the file operations. The winlogbeat.exe creating files seems legitimate since it's an agent for log management. However, the script.bat mentioned in the command line of powershell might be part of malicious activity, like deleting files to cover tracks. There are several ImageLoad events for system DLLs, which aren't unusual but could indicate if they're being loaded abnormally.\n\nThe event with chrome.exe loading amsi.dll stands out because AMSI is used by Windows Defender. If an attacker tries to load it and fails, it might trigger detection, but in this case, it's just loaded normally.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are signs of potential malicious activity: multiple powershell accesses, whoami execution, script deletions, and possible registry manipulation. The confidence level is moderate because while some indicators are present, others could be normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing registry values and being accessed by other processes, along with the execution of whoami.exe and a script named pacote_padrao_script.bat, indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note. \n\nThe first few events show powershell loading various .NET framework DLLs, which seems normal because powershell often uses these for execution. But then there are file creation and deletion events in temporary directories like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. The files created include a PowerShell script with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_..., which is unusual. Creating and immediately deleting such scripts could be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also an event where powershell.exe is used to remove several .bat files from different paths using the Remove-Item cmdlet. The command lines show attempts to delete specific batch files, each located in various directories like \"C:\\componente_ativo...\" and others. The fact that these are being deleted could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or remove malicious scripts.\n\nI notice multiple instances of chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does make some registry changes during normal operation, the frequency here seems high. Combined with other suspicious activities from powershell, this might be part of a larger campaign, possibly using both applications for different stages of an attack.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of files in the Windows Defender directory (MpOAV.dll). This could suggest an attempt to load malicious code into legitimate processes or to bypass antivirus detection. Powershell's ability to execute commands without being detected by some security solutions makes it a favorite tool for attackers.\n\nThe events also show powershell.exe accessing pipes and making registry changes, which are common indicators of post-exploitation activities. These actions can be used to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or communicate with other processes.\n\nIn summary, the combination of multiple powershell instances creating\/deleting files in temporary locations, deleting specific .bat scripts, loading unusual DLLs, accessing registry and pipes, along with chrome.exe's frequent registry changes, raises red flags. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate a cyberattack. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events indicating file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, removal of .bat files, and loading of DLLs, alongside Chrome registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with process information, windows log details, and sometimes file info.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries where the task is \"Process Create\" for various executables like whoami.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, sc.exe, services.exe, conhost.exe, etc. These are all legitimate system processes, so on their own, they might not be suspicious. But since they're appearing multiple times and in combination with other actions, I should look closer.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some of these processes could reveal more. For example, cmd.exe is being used with commands like stopping or deleting services. Specifically, I see \"sc.exe stop objeto_temporario\" and \"sc.exe delete estrutura_secundario\". These commands are related to service control, which might be part of legitimate administration tasks but could also be signs of malicious activity trying to hide traces by disabling or removing services.\n\nThen there's the use of powershell.exe multiple times. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The fact that it's being accessed several times in different events, combined with registry modifications, might indicate some script execution. Registry value sets and deletions could be part of creating or modifying registry keys to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nAnother point is the command line for one of the cmd.exe processes: \"\/c del \/A:H %temp%\\tarefa_logico.txt >nul 2>&1\". This seems like an attempt to delete a file in the temp directory with specific attributes, possibly trying to remove logs or evidence. That's definitely something suspicious because it shows efforts to clean up after some activity.\n\nI also notice multiple events where powershell.exe is being used without command lines specified, which might be obfuscating what exactly was executed. Additionally, there are image load events for various DLLs when running PowerShell, which could be normal if PowerShell is loading certain modules, but it's worth checking whether these are legitimate or part of a malicious script.\n\nConsidering all these together: repeated process creations with potentially harmful commands, use of powershell.exe possibly executing scripts, registry modifications that might indicate persistence or configuration changes, and attempts to delete files. These patterns collectively suggest potential malicious activity. It seems like someone is trying to execute commands that could be harmful, maybe setting up a backdoor or deleting logs to cover their tracks.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I think this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because there are multiple red flags pointing towards possible security incidents.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and registry modifications involving potentially malicious activities like service deletion and file removal indicate suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes being created and accessed. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious because PowerShell is a common tool used both by admins and attackers. But the details matter.\n\nLooking at the command line arguments, there's this part: \"{Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}\". So it looks like they're trying to delete a file in the TEMP directory named key.log without throwing an error if it doesn't exist. That caught my attention because deleting files can be part of data exfiltration or cleaning up traces.\n\nThen, I see events where files are being created and deleted. For example, there's a file created with a long name that includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which sounds like it might be related to script testing or configuration. But then immediately after, the same file is deleted. This pattern of creating and deleting temporary files can be a red flag because attackers often clean up their tracks.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances where the Registry is being accessed and modified. That's concerning because changes to the registry can indicate persistence mechanisms, like adding startup scripts or modifying system configurations to allow for later access.\n\nI also notice that besides PowerShell.exe, there's an event involving whoami.exe. This is a common tool used to check user permissions, but in some cases, it can be part of lateral movement within a network if combined with other actions.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the frequency of these events, they all seem to cluster around similar times, which might indicate a single attack vector or activity window. The repeated creation and deletion of files, coupled with PowerShell commands that attempt to remove logs, makes me think this could be part of an attack chain.\n\nFurthermore, the use of \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" is a common technique in scripting to avoid errors when files don't exist, which might be to prevent detection by not cluttering up event logs. This adds to the suspicion because it's a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these actions could also be legitimate administrative tasks or script executions. However, considering the combination—multiple registry changes, file deletions, and PowerShell commands—it leans more towards malicious activity rather than routine administration.\n\nI'm also noting the specific files being loaded into memory. Some of them are standard system files, but others might indicate malicious payloads or the loading of compromised modules within PowerShell. Without more context, it's hard to be certain, but these signs collectively point towards potential compromise.\n\nIn summary, while individual events could be benign, the batch shows a pattern that suggests an attacker is attempting to delete logs, modify system configurations, and potentially execute malicious scripts. This combination makes the entire batch of events worth investigating for possible security breaches.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits characteristics indicative of potential malicious activity, including file deletion attempts, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments. These actions collectively suggest a possible attack, making investigation warranted.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity:** The prevalence of PowerShell processes is notable, especially since it's often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, the specific commands and their context here raise suspicions.\n\n2. **File Deletion Attempts:** Commands targeting the deletion of log files in the TEMP directory without error handling could be an attempt to remove evidence of prior activity, a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:** Multiple events show registry access, which can be part of establishing persistence or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\n4. **Temporary File Operations:** The creation and subsequent deletion of temporary files with non-standard names might indicate data handling or cleanup activities typical in attacks.\n\n5. **Use of whoami.exe:** While not inherently suspicious, its use alongside other indicators could suggest information gathering for lateral movement within a network.\n\n6. **Command-Line Arguments:** The inclusion of \"-ErrorAction Ignore\" suggests an attempt to suppress errors, possibly to avoid detection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these activities strongly indicates potential malicious behavior. An investigation is recommended to assess the extent of any compromise and implement appropriate remediation measures."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving `powershell.exe`. That's common because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first two events show that a file was created and then deleted by PowerShell. Specifically, it's creating a script in the Temp directory. Creating temporary scripts can be part of normal operations, but deleting them immediately might raise suspicion—it could be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nNext, there are several events where `powershell.exe` is being used with ampersands in the command line, like `'powershell.exe & {}'`. This looks a bit unusual. Using `&` typically allows chaining commands together, but seeing it repeated might indicate some automation or script execution. I wonder if this is part of a larger script or malicious activity.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where `whoami.exe` is being executed. `whoami` is used to get user information, which is common in both scripts and attacks to gather system details. The fact that it's called several times could be part of a reconnaissance effort.\n\nLooking at the file paths, one PowerShell event loads `MpClient.dll`, which is related to Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, so no red flags there. Another event creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory, which might be normal if it's setting up user-specific configurations.\n\nThere are also events involving registry modifications and process accesses. Registry changes can be part of installing software or malicious payloads. Process access events could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nPutting this all together: repeated use of `powershell.exe`, file creation\/deletion, script execution attempts, and multiple calls to `whoami` suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of these actions—creating temporary scripts, deleting them, accessing processes, and gathering system info—is often seen in attack patterns like script-based attacks or lateral movement.\n\nI'm a bit concerned because the frequency of events and the specific actions taken could be indicators of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) or a script trying to hide its tracks. The confidence level is high because while some actions can be benign, the overall pattern looks suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and repeated whoami executions suggest potential malicious activity or script-based attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: PowerShell.exe accessed a process.\n2. **Event 2**: Same as Event 1; another access by PowerShell.\n3. **Event 3**: whoami.exe was created with the command line pointing to its usual system32 location. This is normal for whoami, which typically runs from there.\n4. **Event 4**: Again, PowerShell accessed a process.\n5. **Event 5**: PowerShell set a registry value. That's interesting because modifying the registry can be malicious, but it's also something legitimate scripts might do.\n6. **Event 6**: Another ProcessAccess event by PowerShell.\n7. **Event 7**: winlogbeat.exe created a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent that collects Windows logs, so this seems routine as it writes to its own configuration files.\n8. **Event 8**: More ProcessAccess from PowerShell.\n9. **Event 9**: whoami.exe was created again with the same command line, which is normal.\n10. **Event 10**: Another access by PowerShell.\n\nNow, thinking about this as a whole, there are multiple events involving PowerShell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. While individual instances might not be suspicious, the repeated use of PowerShell could raise an eyebrow because it's often used in attacks (though also commonly used by admins). The registry modification is a red flag since attackers might try to persistence or change system configurations.\n\nHowever, considering the context: if this happened on a system where admins frequently use PowerShell for legitimate tasks, these events alone may not be malicious. Additionally, there are multiple ProcessAccess events without any indication of malicious activity like file creation or deletion, which could be more concerning.\n\nThe whoami.exe processes look benign as they're running from the correct path and don't show any signs of tampering. The winlogbeat activity is normal for log management.\n\nSo, while there's some cause for mild concern with the PowerShell activities, especially the registry change, without additional context or more severe events like file deletions or network traffic, it's hard to say this batch is definitively malicious. Therefore, it might not be worth a full investigation unless other factors are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry may indicate potential malicious activity, despite being common for legitimate use.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
