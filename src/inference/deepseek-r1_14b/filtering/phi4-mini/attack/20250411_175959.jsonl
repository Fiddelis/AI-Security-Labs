{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this log batch. I see a lot of events related to Chrome making network connections and DNS queries, which are pretty normal for a browser, so that doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThe more interesting stuff starts with PowerShell activities. The first thing I notice is the creation of a new PowerShell process. Looking at the command line, there's a script executing several commands: querying local users, getting group members, listing files in 'C:\\Users', and running other system-related commands. This could be legitimate admin activity or it might indicate an attacker exploring the system.\n\nThen, I see multiple ImageLoad events from PowerShell, which is standard when scripts load modules, but combined with the specific commands above, it adds a layer of concern. The file creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1' in the Temp directory is suspicious because it's creating a script file only to delete it afterward, which could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are Registry value sets and pipe creations. These actions are often used by malware for communication or persistence. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might indicate that PowerShell is being manipulated, possibly to hide processes or activities.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple indicators point towards potential malicious activity using PowerShell. The combination of creating a script, executing system commands, accessing sensitive directories, and registry modifications suggests a high confidence level that this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple events involving powershell.exe with potentially malicious command-line arguments, including system queries and file operations, which could indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, etc. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can execute system commands. The use of multiple network-related commands might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nLooking further, I see several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe and other processes. That's normal as part of their operation. There are also Process Create events for net.exe and cmdkey.exe. These utilities can be used maliciously but could also be legitimate admin tasks.\n\nI notice repeated Registry value sets by chrome.exe. Browsers often modify the registry, so this might not be suspicious on its own unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nThere's a file creation event by powershell.exe for pacote_ativo.txt, which translates to \"active package\" in Portuguese. The naming is vague, but without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nMultiple Process Create and Access events tie back to the initial PowerShell command line, which stands out as potentially malicious activity. The combination of several network enumeration commands suggests possible lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nOverall, while some events are normal, the repeated use of PowerShell with multiple system commands raises red flags. It's likely an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution involving network enumeration and potential file creation for malicious purposes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system logs to analyze. Let me take a closer look at each event and see if anything stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nFirst, there's an event where conhost.exe set a registry value. Conhost is typically related to the console window, but sometimes it can be involved in malware activities, especially if it's accessing or modifying registry keys. But I'm not sure yet if this is suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. URLMON.DLL is part of Windows and handles URLs, so that seems normal unless there's an unusual path involved. The path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the correct location, so maybe not a red flag.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect logs, so it makes sense for it to create configuration files. The path seems legitimate, so probably nothing wrong here.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe created modulo_base.txt. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities. Creating a file could be part of malicious activity like dropping a payload or storing data. This might be worth looking into further.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe was installed via the scheduler, which is standard for updates. The command line seems normal too, so probably not an issue here.\n\nSVCHost.exe setting registry values again. SVCHOST can run various services and sometimesmalware uses it. However, without more context on what registry key is being modified, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nAnother instance of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate loading taskschd.dll, which handles scheduled tasks. That seems within normal operations.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing a process—this could be legitimate but also a sign of malicious activity using powershell for command execution or lateral movement. Given that powershell already created a file earlier, this might indicate some level of persistence or data storage.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch has multiple powershell events and several instances where processes are interacting with system files and registry keys. While individually these could be normal, the combination—especially the use of powershell creating a file and accessing processes—might suggest potential malicious behavior. However, without clear indicators like unusual paths or known malicious signatures, it's hard to be certain. So I'm leaning towards interesting but not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and registry modifications, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
