{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or used. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously, especially since it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's accessing files and registry values might indicate suspicious activity.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe running. That's usually harmless, just to check user information, so probably not an issue on its own.\n\nThen there are several cmd.exe instances with command lines involving REG ADD commands. These look like they're modifying the Windows Registry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is concerning because adding entries here can cause programs to run at startup, which is a common tactic for malware persistence.\n\nThere's also reg.exe being used to add registry values. Again, this could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or installing backdoors.\n\nI notice that the same paths are being targeted in the Registry editsâ€”like \"registro_auxiliar\" and \"entrada_principal\". This repetition might suggest a pattern, possibly from malicious scripts trying to ensure their commands are executed on each startup.\n\nLooking at the file events, powershell.exe is creating modulo_padrao.txt. Without knowing what's inside this file, it could be suspicious if associated with other malicious activities. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files seems normal unless there's an unusual path or activity around it.\n\nThe combination of multiple process creations and registry modifications by different executables (powershell, cmd, reg) is a red flag. It suggests possible scripting or automated processes attempting to establish persistence in the system.\n\nI'm concerned because several of these events are related to modifying the Registry to run at startup, which is a common step for malware to maintain access. The use of multiple tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe adds to the suspicion, as attackers often cycle through different tools to avoid detection.\n\nWhile there might be legitimate reasons for some of these actions (like sysadmins using these tools), the volume and specific commands point towards potential malicious activity. I should consider this batch as INTERESTING due to the high number of suspicious process creations and registry modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry, cmd.exe modifying the registry with specific paths, and file creation events suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
