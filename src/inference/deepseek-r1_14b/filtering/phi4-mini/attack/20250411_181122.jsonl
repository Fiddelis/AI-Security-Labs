{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see a lot of PowerShell activity. Specifically, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is creating processes and accessing registry values. That's already a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to hide malicious activities.\n\nThen, I notice that one of the commands in PowerShell is using findstr and select-string with patterns related to 'pass' in various file types. This seems suspicious—it could be an attempt to search for passwords or sensitive information across different files. That's a common tactic in phishing or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there are repeated entries where the same PowerShell command is run multiple times, which might indicate scripting or automated behavior. Also, the creation and deletion of temporary files, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1, suggests that the attacker is trying to execute scripts without leaving a persistent trace, possibly using a one-time script.\n\nThe events also show image loads from various .NET framework components, which might be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the other activities, it adds to the suspicion. The fact that similar commands are being run multiple times could indicate an attempt to bypass detection mechanisms or test different approaches.\n\nFurthermore, there's a process named whoami.exe running, which is often used to gather system information and might be part of lateral movement within a network. The use of notepad.exe accessing registry values also stands out—this isn't typical behavior for Notepad, so it could be an indicator of malicious activity.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which is likely just a log management tool doing its job. Similarly, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal and unrelated to any malicious activities.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, the repeated use of PowerShell with suspicious commands, temporary files, and other atypical behavior points towards potential malicious activity. It's unlikely that this batch would be considered normal or just routine system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe running suspicious commands, including searching for 'pass' in various file types and creating\/deleting temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries from different processes like powershell.exe, svchost.exe, and chrome.exe. Each event has details about the process, Windows log task, and file information.\n\nStarting with powershell.exe, I notice a few things. One of the command lines is using findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various files. That seems suspicious because PowerShell scripts often used for malicious activities might try to extract sensitive info like passwords. The fact that it's searching through .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls files could indicate data theft.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is involved in tasks like file creation and registry value setting. Creating files or modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. Also, seeing the same command line repeated suggests a possible script being run multiple times, which might be a sign of automated malicious activity.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe entries, most are about registry changes and network connections. While this could be normal browsing activity, the number of NetworkConnect events stands out. Malware often uses legitimate tools like browsers for command and control communication or data exfiltration. The repeated attempts to connect might indicate something suspicious, but without more context on the URLs accessed, it's hard to say.\n\nOther processes like svchost.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and Calculator.exe are modifying registry values. These are common system processes, but any unexpected changes could be malicious. For example, svchost.exe is often used by malware because it's a legitimate Windows process, making it harder to detect.\n\nThe file paths also catch my eye. One file created by powershell.exe is in the StartupProfileData directory, which might allow persistence across reboots. Another file named 'objeto_logico.txt' seems arbitrary but could be storing stolen data or logs for exfiltration later.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple red flags:\n1. PowerShell commands searching for passwords in various files.\n2. File creation and registry modifications by powershell.exe, possibly indicating persistence mechanisms.\n3. Excessive network connections from chrome.exe which might be part of C2 communications.\n4. Registry changes by several processes that could be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nThese patterns collectively suggest potential malicious behavior. The combination of data extraction via PowerShell, file manipulation, and network activities points towards an attack or unauthorized access attempt. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further to confirm if a breach has occurred.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including password searches and file modifications, along with numerous network connections from chrome.exe. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what patterns emerge.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. That seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings. Then, I notice 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup, so that's probably just logging and not malicious.\n\nNext up are several events from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's commonly used in attacks. The logs show file creations, process accesses, and registry modifications. These activities alone aren't suspicious, but combined with other actions they could indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThere are commands like using schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Schtasks is legitimate for managing tasks, but deleting specific ones might be part of persistence mechanisms or to remove traces. The command lines show deletion of tasks named in a pattern (e.g., \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\"), which could indicate an attempt to clean up or hide activities.\n\nI also see 'cmd.exe' being used with commands like deleting notepad.exe processes using wmic. This seems unusual because why would someone want to delete notepad.exe? Maybe they're trying to remove evidence or disrupt standard tools.\n\nLooking at the process names and command lines, there's a mix of legitimate actions and potentially malicious ones. The repeated use of schtasks deletions, coupled with powershell and cmd commands that could be used for persistence or data exfiltration, raises flags.\n\nThe events also show registry modifications across different processes, which is concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of process creations, deletions of scheduled tasks, file manipulations, and registry changes. These activities don't necessarily indicate an active breach yet, but they could be signs of lateral movement, data gathering, or setting up persistence mechanisms. The combination suggests possible malicious intent, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving process creations and deletions (e.g., schtasks.exe, cmd.exe), registry modifications, and file operations that may indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or data removal.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"WMIC.exe\" loading different DLL files like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. WMIC is known for being able to execute commands remotely, which can be a red flag because it's often used in malicious activities. Loading these specific DLLs might indicate some kind of exploitation or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen, I see several entries with powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is powerful and commonly abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events suggests unauthorized access to other processes, which could be a sign of privilege escalation or persistence.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running with command lines that don't seem suspicious at first glance, but since it's being executed alongside other potentially malicious activities, I have to consider if it's part of an attack chain. For example, maybe it's used to check user privileges or gather system information.\n\nLooking further, there are cmd.exe and net.exe commands deleting users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and others. Deleting user accounts can be a sign of an attacker trying to remove traces or elevate their access. The use of del command with switches suggests they're trying to clean up or modify user permissions.\n\nAdditionally, I notice several Registry value sets from processes like conhost.exe and cmd.exe. Modifying the registry is another common tactic in attacks for persistence or configuration changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a series of activities that could be part of an attack chain: using WMIC to load malicious DLLs, PowerShell for process access and execution, deletion of user accounts via command-line tools, and registry modifications. These actions collectively raise red flags indicating potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as WMIC.exe loading DLLs, PowerShell accessing processes, deletion of user accounts via command-line tools, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of processes being created, like whoami.exe and powershell.exe. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but it's a common tool, so not sure yet. Powershell is often used for scripting and could be malicious if used inappropriately.\n\nThen I see several events where Registry values are being set or modified by processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. This makes me think that something might be trying to maintain persistence or change system configurations. The registry is a common place attackers target because it allows them to persist across reboots.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe deletes a file in the Temp directory. That could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity. Cleaning up logs or files can be a sign that something is trying to hide its tracks, which raises a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' for powershell.exe. These might not seem immediately suspicious, but combined with other activities, they could indicate the use of PowerShell in a way that's trying to avoid detection or execute certain commands without leaving obvious traces.\n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and used. Powershell can be a powerful tool for both admins and attackers. The repetition makes me think there might be an automated script running, possibly with malicious intent.\n\nThe use of cmd.exe to delete specific files in the Temp directory suggests that someone or something is trying to remove evidence. This behavior could be part of an attack chain where after some activity, cleanup occurs to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are processes like conhost.exe accessing the registry. Conhost is often used as a legitimate Windows process, but if it's modifying the registry without clear reason, that might be concerning.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell instances with suspicious activities, registry modifications, file deletions in Temp, and repeated process creations. This pattern looks like it could be part of an attack where the adversary is trying to establish persistence, execute commands, and cover their tracks.\n\nTherefore, the batch is interesting because it shows signs that might indicate malicious activity, such as potential persistence mechanisms, command execution, and evidence cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances accessing system resources, registry modifications by various processes, file deletions in Temp directory, and suspicious process creations indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe. That's common because PowerShell is often used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The logs show various actions like accessing processes, registry changes, image loads, file creations, and deletions.\n\nI notice that there are several FileCreate events followed by a FileDeleteDetected event for the same temporary PowerShell script file. This could be a sign of script execution testing or something more nefarious, like a script dropping malicious files and then deleting evidence. However, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are multiple RegistryEvent tasks, which involve setting registry values. Malware often uses registry modifications for persistence or configuration changes, so this might be worth looking into. Also, the ImageLoad events load various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender, which could indicate legitimate behavior but might also be a way to hide malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the ProcessAccess and PipeCreated events. These are common in legitimate operations too, especially with PowerShell which often communicates over pipes. But frequent access to processes can sometimes be a red flag for process injection or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nI also spot several instances of whoami.exe being executed. While this is a standard command used to check user permissions, multiple executions without clear context might warrant attention, as it could be part of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nLooking at the files created and deleted, there's a temporary script file and some configuration files for PowerShell startup data. Temporary scripts can be suspicious if they're not expected or don't serve a clear purpose in the user's workflow.\n\nAdditionally, winlogbeat.exe is involved in creating a .yml file. This seems like it could be part of log shipping or monitoring software, but unusual activities around this process might indicate tampering with logging mechanisms to cover tracks.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to involve multiple potentially suspicious actions: script execution and deletion, registry modifications, loading defender-related DLLs (possibly to avoid detection), pipe creation for communication, and repeated use of whoami.exe. While some could be legitimate, the combination raises enough red flags that this batch should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, file creation and deletion of a temporary script, and repeated process accesses. Additionally, the use of whoami.exe multiple times may indicate potential unauthorized access or lateral movement.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is being executed with the command line pointing to its usual location in C:\\Windows\\system32. The task is Process Create, which seems normal since whoami is a legitimate system tool used to display user information.\n\nNext up, powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for both administrative tasks and malicious activities. However, seeing it being accessed without any unusual command-line arguments doesn't immediately raise red flags. It's often used legitimately by admins.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe accessing a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control (UAC) and handles elevation of privileges. Modifying the registry could be normal, but I'll keep an eye out for repeated or unusual changes here.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access follows. This repetition might suggest some script or automated process running PowerShell multiple times, which isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a known malicious routine.\n\nMoving on, svchost.exe is modifying the registry. SvcHost is a generic host process for services and can be used by various legitimate applications. However, since it's known to sometimes be exploited by malware, repeated registry modifications could be concerning.\n\nThere are two more instances of svchost.exe making registry changes. This repetition might indicate some activity that's either part of a normal background process or potentially malicious, depending on what the services are doing.\n\nNext is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool used for log management, so this seems legitimate and not concerning unless there's something unusual about the file creation.\n\nAnother powershell.exe access occurs, adding to the count of such events. As before, without context on what PowerShell is doing, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nwhoami.exe runs again, which I've seen earlier, so nothing stands out here.\n\npowershell.exe is accessed once more, making it five times in total across the batch.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe modifies a registry value. This process is related to Windows shell and application framework, so registry changes might be normal but could also be part of some exploit if modified improperly.\n\nFinally, there are multiple DNS queries and network connections from chrome.exe. While Chrome can have legitimate DNS activity, especially for web browsing, repeated or unusual network connections might indicate something malicious, like drive-by downloads or tracking.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch has several normal activities like whoami, svchost, winlogbeat, and Chrome operations. However, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed, which stands out because PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. Repetitive access without clear context could indicate script execution or lateral movement in an attack. Additionally, the registry modifications by RuntimeBroker and svchost might be part of legitimate operations but could also signal malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\nWhile not all events are suspicious on their own, the combination—especially multiple PowerShell accesses and registry changes—warrants closer investigation. This could be early signs of an APT or script execution attempting to establish persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated access to powershell.exe and modifications to the registry by svchost.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
