{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events involve processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and powershell.exe accessing things or setting registry values. Powershell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be a red flag. But not all powershell activity is bad—it depends on the context.\n\nI notice there are multiple entries where svchost.exe is setting registry values. Svchost is a common process that's part of Windows services, but sometimes malware can hide under it. So repeated registry changes might indicate something suspicious, like installing persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also an event with Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because Calculator is a basic utility; why would it be loading a DLL related to URL handling? Maybe it's trying to do some network activity or load malicious code.\n\nThen there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for log management, so that's probably normal unless it's doing something unexpected here.\n\nWhoami.exe running with a command line seems benign on its own—it's just querying user information, right? But if this were in combination with other activities, it might be more concerning. Similarly, cmd.exe being used to delete processes via WMIC could be problematic. The command \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\" suggests someone is trying to terminate Notepad processes, which might be malicious if Notepad isn't actually running or if there's an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nLooking further down, I see more powershell.exe and cmd.exe entries accessing registry values and loading images. The repetition of these processes doing similar tasks could indicate a script or tool being used to perform multiple actions, potentially as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe use of conhost.exe also stands out. Conhost is usually related to command-line interfaces, but it's sometimes exploited by malware to hide their activity or create backdoors. The fact that it's setting registry values might mean it's trying to establish persistence.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows a lot of process creations and accesses, especially from powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands that could be attempting to terminate processes (Notepad) which is unusual. Additionally, multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry, along with other processes loading unexpected DLLs, could be signs of malicious activity. The repeated use of WMIC to delete processes might indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt legitimate operations.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these activities are part of legitimate system administration tasks, like script-based cleanup routines. But given the combination—especially the deletion of Notepad.exe processes and the use of WMIC in a command prompt—it leans more towards potential malicious behavior. \n\nI'm not entirely certain without more context, but based on the patterns observed, there's enough concerning activity to consider this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including powershell.exe process accesses, svchost.exe registry modifications, Calculator.exe loading unexpected DLLs, and cmd.exe using WMIC to delete processes.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the events involve various processes like chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, schtasks.exe, and conhost.exe. These are common tools that can be used for both legitimate purposes and malicious activities, so I need to see how they're being utilized here.\n\nI notice multiple instances of Registry value sets across different processes—this is a red flag because attackers often modify the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. The frequency of these events suggests potential tampering.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe activity: it's accessed several times, which aligns with how attackers use PowerShell for executing commands and bypassing security measures. Similarly, cmd.exe is used in some cases with specific command lines that involve copying files and deleting tasks—this could indicate an attempt to modify system behavior or delete scheduled tasks to cover tracks.\n\nThe schtasks.exe entries show deletions of existing tasks, which might be part of a cleanup process by malware trying to remove traces of its activity. The use of whoami.exe is another point of interest since it's often used to check user permissions and could be part of privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there are image load events for legitimate DLLs, but in the context of other suspicious activities, this might not be out of place for malware attempting to appear benign.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes known for potential abuse, registry modifications, PowerShell usage, command line operations that could be malicious, and task deletions.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe are all present multiple times. Powershell is appearing quite a bit, which catches my attention because it's commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The frequency of its use here might be a red flag.\n\nI notice several events where Registry values are being set by different processes. cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, and powershell.exe all have 'Registry value set' tasks. This could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms, which are often part of malicious activities.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is also appearing a couple times with the command line pointing to its default location. While legitimate, repeated use might be suspicious, especially if combined with other behaviors.\n\nThere's an event where powershell.exe creates a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1) and then deletes it shortly after. This behavior is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection or to test script policies without leaving evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks from powershell.exe. These could be normal PowerShell operations, but in the context of other suspicious activities, they might warrant closer investigation.\n\nThe final event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which seems benign on its own but should be considered if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with behaviors like registry modifications and file creation\/deletion, combined with other processes known for potential misuse, suggests possible malicious activity. While some events could be legitimate, the overall pattern raises enough concerns to label this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Analysis:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are observed across different tasks (Registry modifications, file creation\/deletion).\n   - Powershell is frequently used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, making its repeated use suspicious.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Various processes (`cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `powershell.exe`) modify the registry, which can be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes typical in malware.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - Powershell creates and then deletes a temporary file. This behavior may indicate an attempt to test script execution without leaving evidence.\n\n4. **Other Suspicious Behaviors:**\n   - The use of `whoami.exe` might be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation.\n   - Repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events in powershell could signal module loading or communication attempts.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - While some activities may be legitimate, the combination of registry modifications, file operations, and repeated powershell usage suggests potential malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:** The batch is deemed interesting due to suspicious behaviors involving multiple processes, Registry modifications, and temporary file handling by `powershell.exe`. \n\nThe events are marked as **interesting**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events from a user's JSONL file. The first thing that stands out is the prevalence of PowerShell.exe processes across multiple entries. There are 16 events in total, and most of them involve powershell.exe either being created, accessed, or performing some action.\n\nIn several entries, the command lines for powershell.exe look suspicious. For example, one entry has a command line like \"& {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\...\\\\tarefa_base_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This kind of script execution is common in malware because it allows scripts to be executed without being directly visible in some cases. The multiple checks for the existence of specific batch files might indicate that the script is trying to verify if certain malicious files are present or attempting to download them.\n\nI also notice that there are several events where powershell.exe loads different DLLs, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, but in some cases, attackers use these for code injection or to execute malicious scripts. The repeated ImageLoad events could be a red flag if they're part of a larger campaign.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process named conhost.exe accessing the registry, which might not be inherently suspicious, but combined with the powershell activities, it raises questions about potential command-line hijacking or creation of new processes that mimic legitimate ones.\n\nAnother point is the file creations. Powershell is creating temporary files in C:\\Users\\ fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp and also accessing a specific path related to Windows Defender's Platform directory. While some operations are normal, others could be part of a persistence mechanism or for storing malicious scripts temporarily.\n\nThe varied tasks include process creation, file creation, registry modifications, and image loads, which collectively suggest a script that's setting up its environment, possibly installing backdoors, or preparing for further actions. The repeated attempts to exit with 0 or 1 based on the presence of files might indicate a way to signal success or failure, which could be part of a communication mechanism.\n\nLooking at confidence level, I'm not entirely sure if all these activities are malicious because some could be legitimate script executions. However, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances with specific command lines and file operations makes me lean towards this batch being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"Suspicious\",\n  \"REASONS\": [\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe processes indicate potential script execution or malicious activity.\",\n      \"details\": \"The logs show several events where powershell.exe is either created, accessed, or performing actions.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts. So any unusual activity here could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's a file delete action logged by Windows Defender related to a .ps1 script in the Temp folder. That might be suspicious because scripts in temporary directories are often used for malicious purposes. The filename '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1' looks like it could be part of some automated testing or possibly an attempt to bypass certain policies by using a test script.\n\nThe second event is another PowerShell process creating a file in the Downloads folder, 'elemento_padrao.txt'. That's not inherently malicious, but combined with other events, it might indicate something. Maybe the script is trying to create files in various locations?\n\nThen there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings, so this alone isn't concerning unless it's part of a larger pattern. But since these are separate processes, maybe they're unrelated.\n\nI see several 'Registry value set' tasks from both Chrome and PowerShell. That makes me think about persistence mechanisms attackers use to maintain access by setting registry keys. If the same user or process is making multiple registry changes, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some of the PowerShell events, they're using conditional checks with Test-Path. For example: \"{if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This seems like a script checking if certain files exist before proceeding, which could be part of a larger script execution or file drop process. If the files don't exist, it might trigger an error or further action.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell is creating files in various directories, like 'pacote_temporario_script.bat' and 'unidade_base_script.bat'. These batch files could execute arbitrary commands, which is a common method for attackers to maintain persistence or drop additional malware components.\n\nThe repeated ImageLoad events from PowerShell loading various DLLs are normal during script execution. However, the specific paths like 'C:\\\\modulo_logico\\\\componente_padrao\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat' and others might suggest a structured way of placing files, possibly indicating a modular approach to malware deployment.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of PowerShell activities that include file creation, registry modifications, and script execution. The presence of multiple .bat files being created and the conditional checks on their existence could be part of an infection process where the script ensures certain components are in place before proceeding. This behavior is often seen in malware where attackers set up persistence mechanisms or deploy additional payloads.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The use of temporary files, registry changes, and multiple file creations across different directories all point towards possible exploit activities.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show 'powershell.exe' as the process. This is a red flag due to its common misuse in attacks.\n\n2. **Analyze File Operations:**\n   - A .ps1 script is deleted from the Temp folder, which could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or prevent analysis.\n   - Creation of .txt and .bat files in various directories suggests potential malicious file drops or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Registry value sets by both Chrome and PowerShell could be part of persistence techniques used by attackers to maintain access.\n\n4. **Command Line Analysis:**\n   - Conditional checks using Test-Path indicate scripts verifying the presence of files, possibly for executing further malicious actions if conditions are met.\n\n5. **Image Load Events:**\n   - DLLs loaded during script execution are normal, but specific paths might suggest structured malware deployment.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The combination of file operations, registry changes, and conditional scripting points towards a possible infection process or persistence setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch log events exhibit a pattern indicative of potential malicious activity involving PowerShell for file manipulation, registry modifications, and script execution. This behavior raises concerns about a possible cyber threat attempting to establish persistence or deploy malware components. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and mitigate any risks."}

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create new files or set content in .bat files. For example, the first event shows a PowerShell script using New-Item and Set-Content to create and modify batch files. This seems a bit suspicious because scripts modifying system files can be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where files are being created or deleted by powershell.exe. The path names in the command lines look complex with multiple backslashes and dots, which might indicate attempts to traverse directories or write to unexpected locations. This kind of behavior could be an attempt to drop malicious scripts or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, some events involve registry value sets. These are concerning because attackers often use the Windows Registry to maintain their presence on a system. The fact that both powershell.exe and conhost.exe are accessing the registry adds more weight to the suspicion of potential malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the repeated creation and deletion of files in temporary directories, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. This could be part of an attempt to avoid detection or to create temporary scripts that are quickly deleted after execution, which is a common tactic in malware to leave minimal traces.\n\nI also notice multiple events where powershell.exe is checking if certain files exist before proceeding. The command line 'if (Test-Path ...) {exit 0} else {exit 1}' suggests some form of persistence check—perhaps ensuring that the script runs only once or after verifying specific conditions, which again aligns with common malware behaviors.\n\nThe events involving file creation and registry modifications are happening in different parts of the system, such as 'modulo_comum', 'estrutura_base', etc. These paths don't seem to be standard locations for typical user scripts, making me more cautious about their legitimacy.\n\nMoreover, there are several entries where powershell.exe loads various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. While these are legitimate components of .NET, attackers sometimes use them in obfuscation techniques or to execute code in a way that's harder to detect.\n\nPutting all this together, the pattern of repeated file creation\/deletion, registry access, complex paths, and self-checking scripts points towards potential malicious activity. These actions don't seem to align with normal user behavior or standard system operations. It could be an attempt at persistence, lateral movement, or deploying malware components.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing scripts indicate potential scripting activity that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - Commands like `New-Item` and `Set-Content` are used to create and modify files, which could be part of installing malware or creating persistence mechanisms.\n   - Complex file paths with directory traversal may target sensitive areas of the system.\n\n3. **Look for File Creation\/Deletion Patterns:**\n   - Frequent creation and deletion of files in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`) suggest attempts to avoid detection or create temporary scripts that are quickly removed.\n\n4. **Examine Registry Access:**\n   - Powershell.exe and conhost.exe accessing the registry could be setting up persistence points, a common technique in malware for long-term presence on a system.\n\n5. **Check for File Existence Checks:**\n   - Scripts using `Test-Path` to check file existence may be ensuring they run only once or under certain conditions, indicative of persistence mechanisms.\n\n6. **Review DLL Loadings:**\n   - Powershell.exe loading various .NET DLLs might indicate obfuscation techniques or code execution methods used by attackers.\n\n7. **Assess File Locations and Activities:**\n   - Scripts modifying files in non-standard locations (e.g., 'modulo_comum', 'estrutura_base') may be attempting to hide their presence or gain escalated privileges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observed activities exhibit patterns consistent with potential malicious behavior, including file manipulation, registry modifications, and self-checking mechanisms. These indicators collectively suggest a high likelihood of compromise, warranting further investigation into the nature of these scripts and processes to assess the extent of any security breach."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is `powershell.exe` with different command lines. Each command line has a similar structure: it's using an `if` statement in PowerShell to check if a specific `.bat` file exists and then exiting based on that. The paths being checked vary each time but follow a pattern like `C:\\somepath\\..`. This repetition makes me think these are part of a script or automated process, possibly checking for the existence of certain files.\n\nNext, there's an event where `powershell.exe` loads `MpOAV.dll` and another where it loads `MpClient.dll`, both related to Windows Defender. That seems normal since PowerShell often interacts with system components. Then, there are file creation and deletion events involving a temporary `.ps1` script in the user's Temp directory. The script is created and then immediately deleted, which could be part of some automated process or testing.\n\nThere's also an event where `whoami.exe` is executed without any unusual command-line arguments. That seems benign; it's likely used for system identification purposes.\n\nLooking at other events, there are registry access and process access events related to `powershell.exe`, but nothing indicating suspicious activity like unauthorized access or modification of sensitive areas.\n\nConsidering all these together, the events don't point to malicious behavior. They're mostly PowerShell activities checking file existence, handling temporary scripts, interacting with Defender components, and standard system commands like `whoami`. The repetitive checks might be from a script running multiple times or as part of a deployment process. There's no evidence of anomalies, failed attempts that should raise flags, or signs of exfiltration or data access.\n\nTherefore, while the events are notable due to their volume and specific actions, they don't collectively indicate malicious intent. They fall within normal operational behavior for a system using PowerShell scripts and Windows Defender.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal PowerShell operations, file checks, and legitimate process activities without signs of malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

These commands exit with 0 or 1 based on whether a file exists. This kind of activity could be part of legitimate scripting or it might indicate an attempt to verify if certain binaries are present, possibly as part of malicious behavior.\n\nI also notice several events where PowerShell is accessing registry values and loading images. While these actions aren't inherently suspicious, the combination with the file checks might raise concerns. Additionally, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script, followed immediately by its deletion. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by creating and then removing a trace of executed scripts.\n\nThere are multiple instances where different executables like whoami.exe and cmd.exe are being run. The use of cmd.exe with a command that exits based on the presence of a file is notable. It seems these processes are part of a chain, possibly trying to execute commands or check system states in a way that might be obfuscating.\n\nConsidering all events together, it looks like there's a sequence of activities involving multiple tools (Powershell, cmd.exe) performing checks on the filesystem and registry. The repeated use of conditionals to exit based on file presence suggests a more complex script possibly trying to execute different payloads or actions depending on system conditions.\n\nWhile individual events might not be alarming, the combination—especially the temporary script creation\/deletion, multiple process creations, and conditional checks across various paths—indicates potential malicious activity.

For example, one command checks if \"C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\elemento_base\\src\\uunitade_principal.cs\" exists and exits based on that. This pattern repeats several times, each time checking a different path.\n\nNext, there are events where whoami.exe is being executed. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which by itself isn't malicious but could be part of a larger script or process.\n\nI also see multiple ImageLoad tasks for powershell.exe, which indicates that it's loading various DLLs, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are normal parts of PowerShell's operation, so they don't raise red flags on their own.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\". This script might be testing something related to PowerShell policies or permissions. Then, immediately after creating it, the file is deleted. This could be suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be indicative of malicious activity trying to bypass certain security measures or leave minimal traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are Pipe Created events related to powershell.exe, which suggests that PowerShell might be using named pipes for communication. While this is a legitimate feature, it's often used in more complex scripts or attacks for command and control.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file checks across different paths could indicate a script attempting to locate specific files as part of an infection process, possibly spreading across the system or checking for certain conditions.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events involve powershell.exe being executed multiple times with varying command lines. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated executions could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all seem to be checking if a specific PowerShell script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) exists in different paths. The pattern here is that each command line tests a different path, which suggests that the attacker might be trying to locate where this malicious script is stored. This repeated check could indicate an attempt to ensure the script is present or perhaps to spread it across multiple locations.\n\nAdditionally, there are events showing file creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell policy test file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1). This might be part of an effort to bypass certain security policies by testing if scripts are allowed, which is a common tactic in persistence mechanisms or malicious activities.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process creation event, which could be used for information gathering about the system, possibly to determine user privileges or system details. Combined with the powershell.exe activity, this adds another layer of concern as it shows potential enumeration activities.\n\nThe registry access and image load events tied to powershell.exe are concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools to mask their activities. The repeated ImageLoad events for files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll might be part of loading malicious payloads or ensuring dependencies are met, which is typical in malware operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances checking for a specific script across various paths, along with file creation\/deletion activities and a whoami.exe execution, suggests potential malicious behavior. This batch shows signs of possible script installation, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration attempts. Therefore, this warrants further investigation to assess if these actions are part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with varying command lines checking for the existence of a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths, along with file creation and deletion activities and a whoami.exe execution.

The commands are using `Test-Path` to see if `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` exists in different directories. This seems suspicious because it might indicate that someone is checking if a malicious script is present before proceeding, which could be part of an attack.\n\nThen there's an entry where `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. I'm not too familiar with this process, but I think WinlogBeat is related to log management. It might be normal behavior, but since it's creating a new configuration file, maybe it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell accessing the `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` directory. That name sounds like it could be part of user profile data, and if PowerShell is interacting with it, it might be trying to elevate privileges or access sensitive information.\n\nThere are a few entries where registry values are being set by both PowerShell and other processes like Notepad and svchost.exe. Registry modifications can be common in malware to maintain persistence or change system configurations, so this could be a red flag.\n\nI also see multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being run. Using whoami is usually harmless, but if it's part of a larger script or process, it might be used to gather user information for an attack.\n\nThe events involving `calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe` loading the same DLL file, `urlmon.dll`, don't immediately raise red flags since that's a legitimate system file. However, if these processes are behaving abnormally, it could indicate something more.\n\nMultiple network connections from both Chrome and svchost.exe stand out because frequent connection attempts can be part of data exfiltration or communication with command-and-control servers. Dns queries from Chrome might just be normal browsing activity, but combined with other events, they could be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several activities that raise my suspicion: PowerShell checks for script existence, registry modifications, process creations like `whoami.exe`, and multiple network connections. These could be signs of a potential malicious activity or an ongoing attack. However, some of these actions might also be part of legitimate system operations or misconfigured scripts. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination does seem noteworthy.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities checking for script existence, registry modifications, process creations, and network connections which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So I'm given a bunch of JSONL events and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Hmm, first, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's about whoami.exe being executed. That seems normal; users might run that to check their permissions or something. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool and often used by both admins and attackers. The tasks include Process Create, Registry access, Image loads, File creation, deletion, and more. I notice that there's a script being created in the Temp directory, then immediately deleted. That seems odd because why create and delete a script? Maybe trying to avoid detection.\n\nWait, the script is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. The double underscores might be an attempt to hide it or make it look like system-generated. Also, after creating and deleting the file, there are several Image Load events for different DLLs. That's normal when running scripts but could also be part of malicious activities.\n\nI see a lot of Registry value sets from powershell.exe. That makes me think they're trying to modify system configurations or create persistence points. Attackers often use the registry to ensure their malware runs on every boot.\n\nThere are Pipe Created events too, which can be used for communication between processes. I'm not sure if that's a red flag yet but it's something to note.\n\nThen there's an event about Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. These seem related to PowerShell starting up or tearing down. It might indicate that the script is running in a non-interactive session, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, conhost.exe is mentioned with a Registry value set. Conhost is often used as a legitimate process, but it can sometimes be abused by attackers to host malicious content. Not sure if this is an issue here.\n\nAlso, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems like it's part of the data collection tool, so probably not suspicious unless there's something else going on.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with various actions, including creating and deleting temporary script files, modifying the registry, loading different DLLs, and using pipes. These behaviors could be indicative of malicious activity like script testing, persistence setup, or data exfiltration. The repeated creation and deletion of the script file to avoid detection is a big red flag.\n\nI think this batch should be considered interesting for investigation because while some actions are normal, the combination raises concerns about potential attacker activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe cybersecurity team identified that the batch of events is **interesting** for further investigation due to potentially malicious activities. Key indicators include multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious actions such as creating and deleting a script file, registry modifications, and possible use of pipes for communication.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing actions indicative of potential malicious behavior, including the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, registry modifications, and pipe usage. These activities may indicate an attempt to hide malicious processes or establish persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I see there are four events here. Each event has a process name, a winlog task, and sometimes a file path. Let me look at each one individually.\n\nThe first event shows 'powershell.exe' creating a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_secundario.txt. I know PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but it's something to keep an eye on because attackers might use it to drop files or scripts.\n\nThe second event is 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its own directory: winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely part of the ELK stack for logging, so this seems normal unless it's behaving oddly.\n\nThe third and fourth events are both from 'powershell.exe'. The third one shows a registry value being set, and the fourth shows a process access event. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially if they're changing system settings or persistence mechanisms. Process access could mean anything, but again, in PowerShell, it's something to watch.\n\nLooking at the combination, I'm noticing multiple events from powershell.exe doing different things. The first creates a file, the third modifies the registry, and the fourth accesses processes. This sequence could be part of legitimate admin tasks, but it might also indicate malicious activity like setting up persistence or dropping files.\n\nI should consider whether these actions are typical for the user 'fiddelis'. If this user is an admin who often uses PowerShell, maybe not. But if there's no prior context, it's hard to say. The use of both file creation and registry changes in quick succession from the same process might raise a flag.\n\nAlso, the creation of a .txt file and then modifying the registry could be part of establishing persistence or creating a backdoor. It's possible that these are steps in an attack chain.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but given the combination of actions from powershell.exe, especially the registry modification and process access, it seems like this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell with file creation, registry changes, and process access suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
