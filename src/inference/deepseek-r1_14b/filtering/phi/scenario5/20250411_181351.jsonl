Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first entry is powershell.exe accessing something. Since PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things, but without more info, maybe not interesting yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Powershell.exe accessing a process is common administrative activity.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe second entry is whoami.exe being run. It's typically used to check user information and isn't malicious on its own.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"whoami.exe is a standard system utility for identifying user information.\"\n}\n```\n\nAnother powershell.exe access, same as the first one.
