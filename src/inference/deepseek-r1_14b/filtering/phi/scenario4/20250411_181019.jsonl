Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of entries where PowerShell is accessed but no file is involved. That doesn't immediately raise a red flag for me because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, without more context on what the script is doing, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nNext, I see a cmd.exe process that's creating a service called win32times with a binPath pointing to a .ps1 script. The path mentioned is c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. That looks concerning because the script name suggests it's non-existing or maybe trying to hide. Creating services with cmd can be part of setting up persistence, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThen there's another sc.exe process creating another service, win32times again, but this time pointing to c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. This duplication makes me think that maybe the attacker is trying different ways to execute scripts, possibly to bypass detection or ensure persistence.\n\nLooking further, services.exe and svchost.exe are involved in setting registry values. These processes can be legitimate but also used maliciously for creating services or modifying the system's configuration. Since they're writing to the registry, it could be part of installing a service or making changes that persist across reboots.\n\nThere are multiple entries from RuntimeBroker.exe and Calculator.exe accessing the registry. This seems a bit odd because these programs typically don't do much in terms of system-level changes. It might indicate that their processes are being used as part of an attack chain, possibly for privilege escalation or to hide malicious activities.\n\nNotepad.exe is also setting a registry value, which is unusual because Notepad is mainly for editing text files. This could be an attempt to create or modify system settings in a way that's not typical for normal usage.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries are interesting too. While it's common for browser processes to interact with the system, multiple RegistryEvent tasks might indicate something suspicious, like loading extensions or altering browser settings without user interaction. Also, the Image loaded event pointing to amsi.dll suggests some kind of anti-malware scanning interface activity, which could be related to detecting malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here of processes (cmd.exe, sc.exe) creating services with non-existing script paths, multiple registry modifications by unexpected programs, and unusual file loading. These activities could indicate that an attacker is setting up persistence mechanisms or deploying malware. The repeated attempts to create services suggest an effort to ensure the malicious code runs on each boot, which is a classic sign of persistent threats.\n\nSo while individual events might not be alarming, the combination points towards potential malicious behavior. Therefore, I would classify these logs as 'Interesting' because they show signs that could be part of a cyberattack or unauthorized system modifications.\n<\/think>\n\n{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{'Multiple log entries indicate potential malicious activity such as service creation with non-existent scripts and unusual registry modifications by unexpected processes.'}}"}
