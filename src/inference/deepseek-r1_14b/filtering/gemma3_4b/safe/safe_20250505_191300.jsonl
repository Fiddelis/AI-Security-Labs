They're logging Image Load and File Create tasks. Since MpCmdRun.exe is part of Microsoft's security tools, these activities are normal and not suspicious on their own. It might be updating or running scans, so nothing unusual there.\n\nNext, I see an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\". This is likely the agent used for collecting Windows logs. It created a file in its configuration directory, which is expected behavior. No red flags here.\n\nThen there's \"svchost.exe\" creating a file. SvcHost is a generic host process for services, so it's normal for it to create files in various locations, especially under SoftwareDistribution where updates and patches are handled. Not concerning.\n\nLooking at the Discord events: multiple NetworkConnectionDetected tasks, PipeCreated events, ProcessAccess accesses, and some ImageLoad activities. These seem typical for a running application like Discord, which would establish connections, create named pipes for inter-process communication, and access other processes as part of its operation. The fact that it's accessing the Run registry key to check if Discord is set to start on login also seems normal.\n\nI notice there are several repeated events, especially from Discord with NetworkConnect and ProcessAccess tasks. However, repetition doesn't necessarily mean something malicious; it could just be the application performing regular operations.\n\nThere's an event where \"reg.exe\" is used to query the Run registry key for Discord. This is a common way for applications to check their own settings, so again, nothing suspicious here unless there's evidence of unauthorized changes.\n\nAnother event involves \"SDXHelper.exe\", which seems like it might be a legitimate helper process, loading standard Windows libraries like combase.dll and urlmon.dll—this is normal behavior for such processes.\n\nThe events from winlogbeat and MpCmdRun also don't indicate any anomalies. They're either creating files or loading images as part of their monitoring or security functions.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, creation of suspicious files, or activities that deviate from the baseline behavior expected in a system with these processes running. All the events are consistent with normal operations for the software involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while the batch contains multiple events, each is within the realm of normal activity for the respective processes. There's no indication of malicious behavior when considering all events together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities involving legitimate processes such as Windows Defender, Discord, and system utilities. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, the majority of these events are related to Discord.exe. There are multiple entries where Discord creates pipes, accesses processes, and connects to the network. While Discord is a legitimate application, repeated network connections could be suspicious if they don't align with normal usage patterns.\n\nI notice that there's an event where reg.exe was used to modify the Windows Registry. Specifically, it added a Run key entry pointing to a Discord update executable. This is concerning because modifying the registry to start processes at startup can be a tactic used by malware to maintain persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there are several file creation events for JavaScript files within the Discord modules directory. While legitimate software does update its components, the path \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\modules\\\" seems unusual and could indicate tampering or malicious activity.\n\nLooking at other activities like Dns queries and Image loads (like urlmon.dll), these are standard for many applications but in combination with the registry modification, they raise flags. The repeated network connections might be an attempt to communicate with external servers, possibly command-and-control channels.\n\nOverall, while Discord is a known application, the unusual file modifications, registry changes, and excessive network activity suggest potential malicious behavior. This batch should definitely be looked into further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities related to Discord.exe, including registry modification and repeated network connections which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events related to Discord.exe. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these events are from a single process—Discord.exe. This makes sense because Discord is a well-known application that frequently interacts with files, processes, and network connections as it runs.\n\nLooking through each event, they include actions like file creation, process access, image loading, registry changes, and network connections. These activities are typical for any application launching or running normally. For example, when you start Discord, it loads its main executable, various DLLs, modules, and establishes network connections to function properly.\n\nI also see that there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess and NetworkConnect events. These are normal operations for an app like Discord as it communicates with servers and retrieves data. The file creation time changes might be part of the application's initialization or updates.\n\nThere’s a registry value set event, which could be Discord configuring its settings on startup. However, without seeing any deviations from expected behavior, such as unusual file accesses, strange network destinations, or multiple failed attempts, these events don't raise red flags.\n\nI should also consider if there are any signs of malicious activity here. Since all activities align with what Discord would do during a normal run, and no suspicious paths or repeated failures are mentioned, it doesn't look like an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nIn conclusion, while the logs show active process handling, file operations, network usage, and configuration changes, these are typical for Discord running as intended. There's nothing out of the ordinary that would warrant a deeper investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe entire batch of events is considered **not suspicious**. These activities align with normal operations of the Discord application, including process initialization, file access, module loading, network connections, and configuration changes."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by understanding what each event is telling me.\n\nThe first event shows Discord.exe changing the file creation time for two different .tmp files in the user's AppData folder. That's a bit unusual because applications typically don't change file times unless there's a specific reason, like maybe trying to avoid detection or tamper with logs. I should keep that in mind.\n\nNext, there are several events where winlogbeat.exe creates a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is usually used for log shipping, so this could be normal if it's part of the setup. But creating a new .yml file might indicate some configuration change or possibly setting up a new logging instance, which might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances where Discord.exe accesses processes and establishes network connections. Discord is a well-known application that often connects to servers, so these events could just be normal operations. However, the frequency of these events is quite high—multiple network connection detections in a row might warrant closer look if they're out of the ordinary for typical usage.\n\nI'm also noticing a lot of repeated \"Process accessed\" tasks by Discord.exe. While it's possible that the application is just being active, such consistent repetition could be an indicator of something more nefarious, like process injection or lateral movement within the network. But without additional context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nLooking at other processes like smartscreen.exe and taskhostw.exe loading standard system DLLs, those are normal activities. They don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: The Discord process showing file time changes and multiple network connections could be concerning, but without more data—like unusual traffic patterns or evidence of malicious code—it's hard to classify this batch as definitely malicious. However, the repeated file creation time changes and excessive network activity might suggest some level of interest for further investigation.\n\nSo, I'd say these events are somewhat interesting because they involve potentially suspicious activities by a commonly used application, but there isn't enough information to confirm malicious intent. My confidence is around 0.6 since it's moderately concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events where Discord.exe changes file creation times and establishes numerous network connections, which may indicate potential tampering or suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs. There are a lot of events here, mostly from Discord.exe showing network connection detections and process access events. Also, there are some file creation and registry activity from other processes like winlogbeat.exe and sppsvc.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve Discord.exe with tasks like Network connection detected and Process accessed. These seem repetitive but aren't necessarily suspicious on their own because Discord is a common application that might handle multiple network connections. However, the frequency could be something to look at—there are 14 such events, which seems a bit high but not entirely uncommon for a busy app.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of the log management system, so this is probably normal as it's setting up or updating configuration files. Similarly, sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll is also routine since that's related to scheduling tasks.\n\nThe svchost.exe accessing a registry value isn't unusual either; svchost is a common host process for various services, and they often interact with the registry. The file creation times changed in Discord's cache directory might be part of normal operations too, as apps often update their cache files periodically.\n\nLooking at all these events together, while there are several instances that could individually raise flags, collectively they don't present a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The repetition of network connections from Discord is notable but without additional context or unusual patterns (like multiple failed attempts or connections to known bad IPs), it's hard to classify this as suspicious.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing the entire batch, I don't see strong indicators of malicious activity. So, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly repetitive and non-suspicious activities from Discord.exe and other common processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
