Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is a process create event for DiscordSetup.exe with the command line pointing to its location. That seems normal since it's just installing or updating Discord. The next events are image loads and file creations related to this setup, which also look standard during an application update.\n\nThen there's a process creation of Update.exe with some command-line arguments about installing. It loads several .NET framework files, which makes sense because many applications use that. But the repeated \"Process accessed\" events for Update.exe caught my attention. Accessing a process multiple times might be normal during installation, but it's worth noting.\n\nLooking further, there are file creation events in the Discord app directory. This seems related to the setup or update process. The final event is Discord.exe starting with some arguments, which aligns with the application launching after an update.\n\nOverall, these logs look like a typical Discord update happening on the system. The repeated process accesses might raise a flag, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. However, all other events are standard for software updates and installations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to see if they're worth investigating. First off, all the events seem to be related to Discord processes and some update-related activities.\n\nThe logs show a lot of \"Process Create\", \"Image Load\", and \"Pipe Created\" events for both Discord.exe and Update.exe. These are pretty standard operations when an application starts up or updates itself. For instance, loading images (DLLs) and creating pipes for interprocess communication are normal parts of how applications function.\n\nI also notice that some events have command lines with specific arguments. For example, one event shows Discord.exe being run as a crashpad handler, which is part of Discord's internal process management for handling crashes. Another event has a long command line with various flags and parameters typical for an Electron-based application like Discord.\n\nThere are no signs of unusual file accesses or permissions changes, nor any indicators of malicious behavior like multiple privilege escalations or writes to system files. All the paths seem legitimate, pointing to standard locations where applications store their data, such as AppData folders.\n\nGiven that all these activities align with the expected behavior of Discord running and updating, there doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary here. This batch of logs likely represents normal operational events rather than malicious or suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard Discord processes and update activities without any indicators of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if this batch of JSONL events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's Discord.exe starting with a bunch of command-line arguments. That seems normal because Discord is a legitimate application and often uses such parameters when launching. The next few events are about process access and image loading, which again are standard actions for any running application.\n\nI notice that there are multiple entries where Update.exe creates files in the Start Menu and Desktop directories. It's creating shortcuts like \"Discord.lnk\". This could be part of a legitimate installation or update process. However, I should consider whether this behavior is typical for updates. Sometimes, malicious software also drops shortcuts as part of their payload.\n\nThere are several events where Update.exe is being accessed multiple times without any file operations in between. That might indicate something suspicious because repeated access to the same file could be an attempt to check if it's present or if certain conditions are met, which might not be necessary for a standard update process.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the paths, they're all within user directories (AppData and Desktop), which is common for application shortcuts. But I should think about whether there are any red flags in the file names or paths. The files created are \".lnk\" files, which are just shortcut links, so that doesn't raise immediate concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, Discord.exe loading various DLLs like ffmpeg.dll and d3dcompiler_47.dll is normal for an application needing multimedia capabilities. These are standard libraries used in applications to handle video and audio.\n\nBut considering all these events together, I'm a bit concerned about the frequency of Update.exe accessing files without any other process creation or network activity mentioned. It's possible that this could be part of a legitimate update routine, but the repeated access might warrant closer investigation to ensure there isn't something malicious happening in the background.\n\nSo overall, while many of these events are normal, the repetitive and somewhat unusual behavior from Update.exe might make the batch interesting for further review.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated file creation and process access by 'Update.exe', which could indicate suspicious activity such as potential malicious shortcut deployment or unauthorized updates.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events are related to Discord.exe loading various DLLs like libEGL.dll and vulkan-1.dll. These seem normal for Discord as they're likely part of its graphics handling. However, the batch also shows that reg.exe is being used to modify the registry. Specifically, there are commands adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. This looks suspicious because such registry changes can be a way for malware to ensure Discord runs at startup or to create protocol handlers that might be exploited.\n\nAdditionally, there's a lot of ProcessAccess events from Update.exe and reg.exe accessing various files and the registry. While some of these could be legitimate system processes, the combination of creating shortcut files (like .lnk) in Start Menu and Desktop, along with modifying the Run key, raises concerns about potential persistence mechanisms or unwanted behavior.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple Pipe Created events from Discord.exe. Such pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but their frequency might indicate something unusual, like a botnet activity or C2 (command and control) channels.\n\nConsidering all these activities together—registry modifications, file creation of shortcuts, and pipe creations—it seems like the batch shows behavior that could be indicative of malicious software attempting to establish persistence or manipulate system configurations. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates potential malicious activity, including registry modifications and file creation by Discord.exe and reg.exe.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with some process info, Windows log details, and sometimes file information.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is \"Discord.exe\". That's not unusual since Discord is a common application people use. The tasks associated with these processes include things like \"Pipe Created\", \"Process accessed\", and \"Process terminated\". These all seem related to normal operations of an application, so nothing suspicious on first glance.\n\nThen there are entries where the process name is \"reg.exe\". I know that reg.exe is a tool used for editing the Windows registry. The command lines show commands adding values to different parts of the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. This seems like Discord is trying to set up some registry entries, maybe to handle URL protocols or integrate with the system's file associations. That sounds legitimate because applications often register themselves in the registry for proper functioning.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with reg.exe, they are \"Process Create\" and \"Registry value set\". These are normal actions when an application is setting up its configuration upon installation or first run. So, no red flags there either.\n\nThere's also an entry where Update.exe loads urlmon.dll. I know that URLMON.DLL is part of the Windows monoculture, related to handling URLs and ActiveX controls. It's a standard library used by many applications, so this doesn't raise any concerns. Similarly, Discord loading ffmpeg.dll makes sense for video processing within the app.\n\nAnother event shows Update.exe creating a .lnk file in the Start Menu. This is just creating a shortcut, which is typical behavior during software installation or setup to add a program to the start menu. Nothing malicious there.\n\nI also notice that many events are related to process creation and termination of Discord.exe. Since Discord is a multi-threaded application with various components (like pipes for inter-process communication), these activities are expected and normal. The repeated \"Pipe Created\" events suggest that Discord is setting up communication channels between its different parts, which is standard for applications.\n\nThe only thing I might look at more closely is the use of command-line arguments in the reg.exe commands. For example, they're adding entries to \"URL Protocol\", \"DefaultIcon\", and \"shell\\open\\command\". These are all typical registry modifications an application would make when setting up protocol handlers or icons. Since Discord is a legitimate app that might want to handle URLs like .discord.gg, this makes sense.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access, strange file creations outside the expected paths, or unusual process behaviors. All activities align with what I'd expect from a user installing or running Discord for the first time, including setting up registry entries and creating shortcuts.\n\nIn conclusion, after reviewing all these events collectively, they don't indicate any malicious behavior. They're all part of standard application operations, especially during setup or runtime.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal Discord.exe and reg.exe activities such as process creation, registry modifications, file associations, and termination events, which are expected during legitimate operation.\"\n}\n```"}

That's repeated several times, which seems like normal process access events. Not too concerning yet. Then there's an event where Update.exe creates a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk. A .lnk file is a Windows shortcut, so that might be notable because it's linking to Discord.\n\nContinuing on, more process accesses and terminations happen with Update.exe. Then I see events related to Discord.exe starting up. There are several Process Create tasks for both Discord.exe and DiscordSetup.exe. The command lines show Discord running with various parameters, which is typical for a background or crash handler process. \n\nI also notice some file operations where Discord loads its main executable and ffmpeg.dll, which are expected as part of the application's startup.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to be part of normal user activity. The creation of the .lnk file could be suspicious if it's unexpected, but without more context like who created it or when, it's hard to say. However, given that the rest of the logs are standard process and file operations related to Discord and its setup, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior.\n\nSo overall, while the creation of a shortcut might raise an eyebrow, the absence of other red flags and the prevalence of normal application startup activities suggest this batch isn't particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to standard process activity and file operations associated with Discord and its update processes.

First off, I notice that all the events are tied to Discord's processes, which is a legitimate application. The tasks include things like creating pipes, loading images, accessing processes, and file operations.\n\nThe first event shows Discord creating a pipe, which makes sense for inter-process communication. Then there are multiple ImageLoad events pointing to various DLL files within the Discord app directory. These are standard dynamic link library loads that you'd expect from any running application, especially one like Discord that uses multimedia components like ffmpeg.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the Process Create events, it's pretty detailed with flags for network services and various features being disabled or enabled. This seems normal for Discord as it starts up with specific configurations.\n\nThere are several ProcessAccess events without any associated files, which might be a bit odd, but they could just be part of the process monitoring without direct file interactions. The FileCreate tasks involve creating .lnk files on the desktop and in the start menu, which again is typical behavior for an application wanting to add shortcuts.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from Discord.exe processes. The tasks include \"Process accessed,\" \"Pipe Created,\" \"Image loaded,\" etc. These seem normal since Discord is a well-known application that runs with multiple background processes.\n\nI notice there are two instances where reg.exe is used to modify the registry:\n1. Adding HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with \"\/ve \/d 'URL:Discord Protocol' \/f\"\n2. Adding HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with \"\/v 'URL Protocol' \/f\"\n\nThese commands add registry entries, which might be Discord setting up protocol handlers for its URLs.

All the processes are from the same user and location, which is expected for a legitimate application.\n\nSo, while there are some registry modifications, they align with Discord's normal operations to handle its protocol.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event one by one and see what they're telling me.\n\nFirst, there are two events where reg.exe is used to execute commands. The command lines look like they're setting registry values for Discord. That seems normal because applications often set their own icons or shell entries. So, the first thought is that this could be part of a legitimate setup process by Discord when it starts up.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where Discord.exe accesses processes and creates pipes. Creating named pipes can be part of inter-process communication, which is standard for applications needing to talk to each other, especially in something like Discord, which might have background tasks or services running.\n\nLooking further, I see several network connection detections from Discord.exe. Network activity is common for apps that need to connect to servers, so this alone doesn't raise a red flag unless the connections are unusual. However, all these events seem related to normal operation—checking in with Discord's servers, fetching data, etc.\n\nThere's also an event where reg.exe sets a registry value again, which as I thought earlier, is part of setting up Discord's shell integration or default icon. No indication here that it's doing anything malicious like hiding files or changing system configurations in a harmful way.\n\nAdditionally, there are DNS queries and image loads for DLLs like ffmpeg.dll and Google.Widevine.CDM.dll. These seem legitimate as Discord might use such libraries for video processing and other functionalities.\n\nI'm also noticing a process creation event with a very long command line that includes various flags. This looks like Discord starting up with specific configurations, which is normal. The presence of these flags doesn't indicate any suspicious activity; they're typical for setting language preferences, enabling services, etc.\n\nThere's an event where a file executable (Google.Widevine.CDM.dll) is detected, but since it's part of the expected operation and used for DRM purposes, this isn't concerning. The process accessing various files in the user's AppData folder also seems normal, as Discord stores user data there.\n\nPutting all these events together, they seem to paint a picture of Discord initializing, setting up its environment, communicating with its servers, and performing standard operations like loading necessary libraries. There are no signs of unusual processes, writes to unexpected locations, or other indicators that would suggest malicious activity. Everything appears consistent with how Discord should behave when launching and running.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these events collectively, I don't see any red flags that would make this batch interesting from a security investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Discord startup processes, including registry modifications and network connections, which do not indicate malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"Discord.exe\" as the process name. The winlog task is \"Network connection detected,\" which suggests that Discord is making some network connections. That seems normal because Discord is an app that typically connects to servers for communication. But I'm noticing that this event repeats multiple times—like 7 times in a row. Maybe it's part of the initial setup or different connection attempts.\n\nThen, there's another event where the task is \"Process terminated.\" So Discord.exe has closed or was terminated. That could be normal if the app is shutting down properly, but sometimes processes terminate abnormally, which might be suspicious. I'm not sure yet because it's just one termination event among others.\n\nThe next event shows a registry value being set by Discord.exe. Registry modifications can be tricky because malicious software often makes changes there to persist across reboots or gain privileges. But again, Discord is a legitimate app and probably does make some registry changes as part of its operation. So I need to think about whether this is within normal behavior for Discord.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, all events are from Discord.exe, which is a known application. The network connection and registry access could be normal depending on what Discord is doing. However, the repetition might raise a flag. If the same process keeps opening and closing connections repeatedly, it might indicate something unusual like an attempt to connect to multiple servers or possibly some form of scanning.\n\nBut I'm not certain if these activities are malicious or just part of Discord's standard operation. Without more context about what each network connection is for or why the registry value was set, it's hard to say definitively. If there were signs of failed connections or unusual ports being used, that might be a red flag, but the logs don't specify that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the events aren't obviously malicious, they do involve repeated actions by a legitimate process which could still warrant closer examination to ensure nothing suspicious is happening under Discord's operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of normal network connection attempts and process termination events from the Discord.exe application, which are typical for its operation.
