So first, I'll go through each event one by one.\n\nStarting with the first five entries, all are from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because browsers do make a lot of network requests and DNS lookups. Not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, moving to powershell.exe events. The seventh event shows a command line that's downloading a file from GitHub using WebClient. This is a red flag because PowerShell downloading files, especially from random sites, can be malicious. It's known for being used in attacks.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry accesses and image loads by powershell.exe. That could indicate it's trying to execute code or load modules, which might be part of a payload execution. Also, the file creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell script files suggest attempts to bypass certain security policies or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe events towards the end also show repeated Powershell processes downloading files from various GitHub repositories into TEMP directories. This pattern is concerning because it indicates automated downloading of potentially malicious scripts or tools. The fact that each download uses a different repository path but follows a similar structure might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, this batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing network downloads, creating temporary files, and accessing system components. These actions are common in malware behavior, especially when combined with how they're being executed from the command line. The repeated attempts could indicate a script trying different modules or payloads, which is a strong sign of malicious activity.\n\nI'm also noticing that each download path ends with LICENSE.txt, but GitHub often has such files at the root. However, in this context, having multiple downloads into TEMP and then deleting them might be an attempt to clean up evidence, making it more suspicious.\n\nSo overall, while some events are normal (chrome.exe activities), the powershell.exe behaviors strongly indicate potential malicious activity that requires investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell.exe executing network downloads and creating\/deleting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Let me try to make sense of them.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries related to PowerShell. Specifically, there are commands that download files from GitHub repositories using `WebClient.DownloadFile`. For example:\n```\npowershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\", \"$env:TEMP\\estrutura_temporario.txt\")}\n```\nThis is interesting because downloading files from arbitrary URLs can be a red flag. It could indicate an attempt to download malicious code or scripts, which is often part of an attack chain.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where `chrome.exe` sets registry values:\n```\nprocess: {'name': 'chrome.exe'}, winlog: {'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\n```\nDoing this repeatedly might be a way to persistence or to make changes to the system configuration. While Chrome does perform some registry operations, doing so multiple times in quick succession could be suspicious.\n\nI also see several file creation events related to `powershell.exe` and other processes:\n```\nprocess: {'name': 'powershell.exe'}, winlog: {'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}, file: {'path': ...}\n```\nThese files are being saved in various locations like the TEMP directory, user downloads folder, and the PowerShell StartupProfileData. The fact that multiple files are being created by PowerShell could be part of an attempt to execute scripts or store malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` process making a network connection:\n```\nprocess: {'name': 'MpDefenderCoreService.exe'}, winlog: {'task': 'Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)'}\n```\nWindows Defender services typically make such connections for updates or scans. It's not inherently suspicious, but if it's paired with other activities, it might warrant closer look.\n\nThere are also multiple instances of `winlogbeat.exe` creating files in its data directory. This seems related to log management and might be normal if that's part of the system's operation. But considering the context with other events, it could be something else.\n\nI also notice some other processes like `conhost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `notepad.exe` making registry changes. While these are legitimate processes, unusual or repeated access to the registry can sometimes indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if all these events happened within a short period, it might suggest a coordinated attack where multiple steps are being taken quickly. The combination of downloading files, modifying registry entries, creating new files, and network activity could be part of an infection or exfiltration process.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n1. **Malware Infection**: The PowerShell commands are downloading malicious scripts which then execute to install malware on the system.\n2. **Lateral Movement**: If this is happening across multiple machines, it could indicate lateral movement within a network.\n3. **Persistent Backdoors**: Modifying registry entries might be an attempt to create persistent backdoors for future access.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities are part of normal operations. For example, some processes like `winlogbeat.exe` or `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` performing legitimate tasks. However, the volume and combination here raise concerns.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming, the pattern—especially involving multiple PowerShell commands downloading files, registry modifications, file creation in various directories, and network activity from non-standard processes—is concerning. It suggests potential malicious activity that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits a series of activities that collectively raise suspicions of potential malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Downloads**: Multiple PowerShell commands download files from GitHub repositories, which could be malicious scripts or payloads.\n   - **File Creation**: Numerous files are created in various locations (TEMP, downloads, startup directories), possibly for storing malicious code.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Chrome.exe**: Repeated registry changes by Chrome might indicate unauthorized modifications or persistence mechanisms.\n   - **Other Processes**: `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `notepad.exe` also modify the registry, which is suspicious in volume.\n\n3. **Network Activity**:\n   - **MpDefenderCoreService.exe**: A network connection detected from this process could be normal for updates but might warrant closer inspection given other activities.\n   - **winlogbeat.exe**: Network activity related to log management; however, combined with other events, it's worth monitoring.\n\n4. **Process Interactions**:\n   - **Malicious Scripts**: The combination of file downloads and registry modifications suggests potential malware installation or persistence.\n   - **Lateral Movement**: If these activities span multiple machines, it could indicate lateral movement within a network.\n\n5. **Timestamp Consideration**:\n   - Events occurring in quick succession might indicate a coordinated attack, making the situation more concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual events may not be alarming, the collective pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as malware infection or persistent backdoor creation. Further investigation is recommended to assess the severity and mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are standard Windows processes and files. Next, svchost.exe modifying the registry—svchost is a common service host process, so it's not unusual for it to interact with the registry.\n\nThere are multiple entries of svchost.exe setting registry values. This repetition could be part of legitimate system operations or might indicate something more malicious if combined with other suspicious activities. Then Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll again, which is consistent with calc.exe behavior and likely normal.\n\nI notice powershell.exe being accessed a few times. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so I'll keep an eye on its command lines. The first time it's just ProcessAccess, but later there are more actions like RegistryEvent and ImageLoad.\n\nLooking at the events with commands: one cmd.exe deletes a scheduled task named 'spawn'. SCHTASKS is a legitimate tool for managing tasks, but deleting without proper justification might be suspicious. Then another cmd.exe line tries to delete a registry entry related to Run key, which is often used by malware for persistence.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe accesses the registry and whoami.exe runs in a command prompt. Whoami is usually harmless, but if it's being called without a clear purpose, it might be part of user enumeration.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry, deletion of tasks and registry entries using cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe accesses with potentially malicious commands. These activities could indicate an attempt to remove traces or disable security features, possibly as part of a larger attack.\n\nThe repeated use of different executables (cmd, conhost, reg.exe) to modify the system's configuration might be an attempt to evade detection by using various tools. Also, powershell is often used in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands remotely.\n\nI should consider whether these actions are part of a legitimate process or if they're indicative of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration. The combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and using PowerShell without clear context makes this batch of logs potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags that suggest potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Registry Modifications**: Multiple instances of svchost.exe making changes to the registry could be part of legitimate operations but might also indicate an attacker attempting to alter system configurations.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion**: The use of SCHTASKS to delete a task named 'spawn' is suspicious, especially if this task wasn't created by a known process. This could be an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt monitoring.\n\n3. **Registry Key Deletion**: Commands using REG DELETE targeting the Run key suggest efforts to eliminate persistent malware entries, which is a common tactic in attacks to ensure the malware isn't automatically restarted on boot.\n\n4. **Abuse of PowerShell and cmd.exe**: The frequent access to powershell.exe without clear justification could be malicious scripting. Additionally, cmd.exe commands are often used in command-line attacks for their simplicity and effectiveness in executing arbitrary code.\n\n5. **Process Creations with conhost.exe and whoami.exe**: These processes might be part of user enumeration or persistence mechanisms, where attackers gather system information or maintain access.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities—registry modifications, task deletions, and misuse of powerful tools like PowerShell—indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. This batch of logs should be thoroughly investigated to identify and mitigate potential threats."}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries with the process name as 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The command line in some logs shows \"& {}\", which might indicate script execution or command chaining. That could be suspicious because it's common in scripts to hide malicious commands.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several 'Process Create', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' events. Registry modifications can be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that malware uses. The image loads point to DLLs being loaded by PowerShell, which could mean they're executing code from those libraries.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created and then deleted in quick succession: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. This temporary script file might be part of testing script execution policies, but the creation followed by deletion could indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother event is about a pipe being created by PowerShell. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication and can be exploited for command injection or lateral movement in a network. Malware might use this to communicate with other processes or establish a command-and-control channel.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a configuration file, but since that's a legitimate tool for log management, it's probably not suspicious on its own unless there are other indicators related to it.\n\nAdditionally, some entries show the 'conhost.exe' process modifying registry values. Conhost is usually associated with console host processes, so seeing it perform registry changes might be out of the ordinary and worth looking into.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell instances with suspicious command lines, file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, image loads, pipe creation, and other events that could indicate malicious activity. These are classic signs of potential exploitation or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process creations, suspicious command lines, file operations, and registry changes suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is being accessed and modified in the registry. That could be a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities. The fact that it's accessing and setting registry values might indicate some kind of configuration change or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see \"powershell.exe & {}\", which looks like an attempt to execute commands through PowerShell without any obvious arguments. This could be a way to hide malicious code or load scripts from other locations.\n\nThere are also several instances where files are being created and then deleted quickly. For example, a script named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1\" is created and immediately deleted. Such behavior is suspicious because it suggests the creation of temporary files that might be used for malicious purposes before they're erased to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are file loads from various .NET framework locations and Windows Defender components. While these could be legitimate, the repeated loading of such modules in conjunction with other activities might raise concerns about lateral movement or privilege escalation within a compromised system.\n\nThe use of multiple processes like cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe further supports the idea of malicious activity. These tools are commonly used by attackers for information gathering (like using whoami to check user privileges) and executing commands without being detected easily.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of activities that are indicative of potential exploitation or malicious behavior. The combination of PowerShell usage with registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and the use of various system tools makes this batch particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activity including repeated PowerShell.exe process creations, command line arguments that appear to hide operations, and file creation\/deletion patterns indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'll go through each event one by one and see if there's anything that stands out.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: Calculator.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because many applications do that during installation or setup. Then, powershell.exe creating a pipe—Powershell is commonly used, so this isn't unusual unless it's part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking further down, I see multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values. Chrome sometimes does this for updates or settings changes, so that doesn't raise a red flag by itself. There are several such events, which might just be normal operation.\n\nThen there's a process with command_line \"powershell.exe & {}\". The ampersand suggests it's running another command after, but without knowing the exact command, it's hard to say if it's malicious. However, this could be part of automation or legitimate scripting.\n\nNext, powershell.exe loading various DLLs like MpClient.dll and creating files in the StartupProfileData directory. Some of these actions are standard for Powershell scripts, especially when dealing with modules or configurations. The file creation path seems to be a local user's AppData folder, which is typical for user-specific settings.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is executed. This is often used to check permissions and might indicate someone trying to enumerate user information, but without context, it could just be a legitimate process or part of a script checking the environment.\n\nThe last few events show Powershell loading several .NET framework DLLs, which again seems normal unless there's an unusual combination of loaded modules that hint at malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (powershell.exe, chrome.exe) performing registry writes and creating files. While each individual event might not be suspicious, the volume could suggest something is off. For example, Chrome setting a lot of registry values in quick succession isn't typical. Also, the Powershell scripts deleting temporary files (objeto_principal.zip) could indicate cleanup after some activity—maybe malicious.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or additional event types (like network connections, file hashes), it's hard to be certain. The batch shows signs that might warrant closer inspection but doesn't conclusively prove malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential suspicious activity, such as repeated registry modifications by non-standard processes and file deletions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}

The use of RegistryEvent tasks might indicate an attempt to persistence or modify system configurations.\n\nLooking at the files being deleted, they're all .zip files with names like tarefa_base.zip. These names don't seem standard for legitimate processes. Plus, the repeated calls to Remove-Item suggest automated deletion, possibly covering tracks.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe loads MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender's directory. While these could be part of normal operations, unusual access patterns might indicate an attempt to bypass detection or load malicious modules.\n\nThe batch includes a process called conhost.exe accessing the registry, which is often used in command-line tools but can be a red flag when combined with other suspicious activities.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. The command lines show things like Remove-Item on temp files, which seems suspicious because deleting files from the temp directory without a clear purpose could be malicious. But I should check if this is part of normal operations or something else.\n\nLooking at the tasks: Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, and File operations. The FileDeleteDetected task caught my eye because it's about deleting a file, but in this case, the file path seems random with GUID-like names. That might indicate script execution testing permissions or trying to delete logs.\n\nThere are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing registry values and loading images. This could be part of normal scripting, but combined with the deletions, it raises flags. Also, the repeated use of powershell.exe with similar commands might suggest automated or malicious activity.\n\nI notice a file creation and then deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1. Creating and immediately deleting a script file could be an attempt to avoid detection by removing evidence after execution. This behavior is often seen in malware or script-based attacks.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which is commonly used to check user permissions or system information. If this is run without a clear purpose, it might indicate reconnaissance before more malicious actions.\n\nThe confidence level: While each event individually might not be conclusive, the combination—especially the repeated powershell commands with file deletions and script testing—is concerning.

I know that legitimate software often interacts with the Windows Registry, so these might not be suspicious on their own unless they're part of an attack chain.\n\nNext, there's \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" also setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is related to UWP app containerization, so it's common and probably not malicious.\n\nThen I see several instances where \"powershell.exe\" is being accessed with the ProcessAccess task. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities, especially in script-based attacks. The frequency here could be a red flag if these accesses are unusual or come from unexpected sources.\n\nThere are also events of \"whoami.exe\" being executed. Whoami is typically used to check user information and permissions, which can be part of reconnaissance by attackers to escalate privileges.\n\nFinally, there's an event where \"winlogbeat.exe\" created a file. Winlogbeat is usually associated with log management tools like the Elastic Stack, so that seems benign unless it's being misused.\n\nLooking at all these together, the repeated use of PowerShell and whoami.exe stands out.
