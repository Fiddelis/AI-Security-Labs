Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few entries are all about 'chrome.exe' with network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes those types of connections regularly. Nothing suspicious there on the surface, but I'll keep an eye out if other activities coincide.\n\nThen, I notice events involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks, but it's also commonly abused by attackers. The first event shows a command line with a script that downloads a file from GitHub into the TEMP directory. That caught my attention because downloading files, especially from external sources, is something to monitor.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe creates temporary scripts and deletes them right after. For example, it creates __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 and then immediately deletes it. This behavior might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving no trace on the filesystem. It's a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to hide their activities.\n\nAnother point is that several events have similar command lines, each downloading different files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, which seems odd because those are usually static and not executable. This repetition makes me think of automated or script-based activity, possibly indicating a botnet or malicious script execution.\n\nAdditionally, the powershell.exe process is accessing registry values and loading various DLLs. While this can be normal for legitimate scripts, it's concerning when combined with the file downloads and deletions. It might indicate the script is trying to establish persistence or perform other malicious actions.\n\nThe fact that multiple events show 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks without much context also raises questions. This could mean the process is interacting with system services in a way that's not immediately clear, adding more layers to investigate.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell.exe activity with external file downloads, temporary script creation\/deletion, and registry access points towards potential malicious behavior. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests there's something worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities with external file downloads and temporary script creation\/deletion, indicating possible malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that involve downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches like 'registro_comum' and 'modulo_comum'. This could be suspicious because downloading files from external sources, especially via powershell.exe, is often a common tactic for malicious activities like downloading scripts or tools.\n\nThen there are multiple events where Chrome.exe is setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the Windows Registry for settings, multiple such events in quick succession might indicate something unusual, but it's less immediately concerning than the PowerShell activity.\n\nLooking further, I see that 'MpDefenderCoreService.exe' has a network connection event. This could be normal as part of antivirus operations, but it's worth noting.\n\nThere are several instances where files are being created by various processes like powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. For example, powershell.exe creates files in the user's Downloads folder with names like 'elemento_padrao.txt' and 'entrada_base.txt'. These file creations might be part of a script or malicious payload being executed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry value sets by various processes, including conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and others. While some of these are legitimate system processes, the combination with the PowerShell activity makes this batch more concerning.\n\nThe presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files in its own directory might be part of log shipping or data collection, but it's worth verifying if this is expected behavior in the environment.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions downloading files from GitHub, file creations by powershell in user directories, and several registry modifications across different processes. These activities could indicate an ongoing malicious process, such as script execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The repeated attempts to download files and modify system configurations are red flags that need further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions attempt to download files from external repositories, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are standard Windows processes. Next, svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is known for running system services, so that might be legitimate. It repeats a few times with the same process and task, which could indicate some script or service updating settings periodically.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same as calc.exe, seems standard. Powershell.exe accessing processes—Powershell is commonly used for both good and bad purposes, so I should keep an eye on how it's being used here. The command line isn't provided, but the event shows process access, which could be part of a script or legitimate admin activity.\n\nWhoami.exe running with its usual parameters. That's often used to check user permissions, not inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger sequence. Powershell again accessing processes—maybe scripting or legitimate use. There's another cmd.exe command deleting a task using SCHTASKS. Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up after something, but if this is done by an unauthorized process, it might indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. This repetition could suggest that Powershell is being used in a loop or script, which might not be suspicious on its own, but when combined with other activities like deleting tasks and registry entries, it raises flags.\n\nThere's also an event where reg.exe deletes a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is the run key where applications set startup entries. Deleting this could be part of uninstalling software or removing persistence mechanisms, which might be malicious if done by unauthorized code.\n\nConhost.exe modifying the registry—conhost is typically used for console windows, so it's unusual to see it interacting with the registry in a way that modifies values. This might not be standard behavior and could indicate something fishy.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe) accessing and modifying the registry, deleting scheduled tasks, and altering startup entries. These activities resemble those of malware trying to remove traces or clean up after installing itself. The repetitive use of Powershell and cmd with specific commands like SCHTASKS and REG DELETE suggests potential malicious scripting.\n\nI should also consider if these actions are part of legitimate system administration. However, the combination of deleting tasks, registry entries, and using multiple tools like reg.exe and powershell.exe without clear justification could indicate an attacker trying to cover their tracks or deploying a script for persistence or damage.\n\nSo, overall, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activities that require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving process creations and modifications to system files and registry entries by svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, reg.exe, and conhost.exe.

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something with task ProcessAccess. That's normal since PowerShell often interacts with system processes.\n\nNext, several events show powershell.exe with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}'. The task here is Provider Lifecycle, which seems routine as PowerShell initializes its providers.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where powershell.exe sets registry values (RegistryEvent). This could be suspicious because writing to the registry can indicate malicious activity. However, sometimes scripts or legitimate software do this too.\n\nLooking further, I see ImageLoad events for various DLLs. These include system files like mscoree.dll andclr.dll, which are standard for PowerShell execution. The mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender is also normal as it's part of the defender service.\n\nThere's a FileCreate event for a .ps1 file in the temp directory and an immediate FileDeleteDetected after that. This could be a red flag because creating and then deleting a script quickly might be trying to hide malicious code. However, sometimes legitimate scripts do this too, especially during tests or cleanup processes.\n\nA PipeCreated event follows. PowerShell often creates pipes for communication between parent and child processes, so this isn't unusual on its own.\n\nAnother FileCreate event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml file, which seems unrelated to potential malicious activity.\n\nMore RegistryEvents and ImageLoad events follow, all within normal ranges for PowerShell operation.\n\nLastly, there's a ProcessAccess event and some startup profile data creation, which are standard actions during script execution.\n\nPutting it all together: while some elements like the quick create\/delete of a temp .ps1 file could be concerning, the overall pattern doesn't strongly indicate malicious behavior. It might just be a PowerShell script running legitimate operations or testing certain functionalities. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem particularly interesting for further investigation unless more specific indicators are present.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal PowerShell activity, including process creation, registry modifications, and file operations.

Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so repeated access might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell.exe processes have unusual command_line parameters like \"& {}\". This could indicate that they're being executed without any visible commands, which might be a way to hide malicious activity.\n\nThere are also multiple file operations involving creating and then deleting a .ps1 script in the temp directory. Creating and immediately deleting scripts can be a tactic to avoid detection or to test if script execution is allowed, which could be part of an attack strategy.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious, combined with other activities, it might suggest that powershell is executing code that's not typical.\n\nThe process creation events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe aren't immediately concerning on their own, but when paired with the extensive powershell activity, they could be part of an attempt to gather information or execute commands.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple registry modifications, file operations in temp folders, and unusual command-line arguments for powershell.exe raises red flags.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from Calculator.exe and chrome.exe performing tasks like creating pipes or setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because those are common applications; I wonder why they'd be doing these operations.\n\nThen, powershell.exe appears multiple times with various activities. There's a lot of RegistryEvent tasks where it's setting registry values, which could indicate configuration changes. Also, there are PipeCreated events and ProcessAccess actions, which might mean that PowerShell is interacting with other processes or creating communication channels.\n\nLooking further, I see some FileCreate tasks for PowerShell startup profile data. That makes me think about user-specific configurations or script execution on startup. There's also a whoami.exe process being created, which is often used to check user permissions and could be part of privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAnother red flag is the command lines in some powershell.exe processes. For example, one has \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\", which suggests that it's trying to delete a file in the TEMP directory. Cleaning up traces could be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.\n\nThere are also multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when powershell.exe runs, which is normal but paired with other suspicious activities makes me more cautious. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks make me think that there might be persistence mechanisms or modifications being made to system configurations.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple instances of PowerShell performing file operations, registry changes, and creating pipes—it's possible that this could be part of a malicious script trying to establish persistence, download files, or execute commands. The use of whoami.exe adds to the suspicion as it can help gather system information for attacks.\n\nI also notice that Calculator.exe and chrome.exe are involved in some events, which is odd because they're typically benign apps. Their involvement with pipes and registry modifications might be part of a broader attack vector, perhaps acting as components in a larger script or toolset.\n\nPutting it all together, there's enough evidence of unusual behavior across multiple processes to suggest that this batch could indicate malicious activity. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity including registry modifications, file operations, and process interactions, along with the use of whoami.exe, suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few lines involve powershell.exe. It starts with an Image loaded event for MpOAV.dll. Then there's a File created event for a temp file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. After that, the same file is deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and immediately deleting a script could be a way to hide malicious activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is used with command lines removing items from the TEMP directory. The commands remove various .zip files like tarefa_base.zip, componente_comum.zip, etc. Removing temporary files isn't unusual, but doing it so systematically and across different files might indicate an attempt to clean up evidence.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes or sets registry values. For example, one event shows a File created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This could be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious scripts to run at startup. Registry changes can also be a red flag because attackers often modify registry settings to maintain access or alter system behavior.\n\nThere are some events related to chrome.exe loading DLLs and modifying the registry. While this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, it's worth noting as part of overall system activity.\n\nI also notice a whoami.exe execution. This is interesting because it's commonly used to check user privileges. Malware might use it to determine if they're running with admin rights or to gather information about the environment.\n\nOther events involve conhost.exe and more process access events by powershell.exe, which could be related to command execution or lateral movement within a network.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe for file deletion and registry modifications is concerning. The creation and deletion of a script in the temp directory might suggest an attempt to execute arbitrary code temporarily. The removal of various files from the TEMP folder could be part of an attempt to erase traces of previous activities.\n\nWhile some of these actions can occur during normal system operations, the combination—especially the pattern of file deletions across different temporary files and registry modifications—is indicative of possible malicious behavior. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe for such tasks is a common technique in cyberattacks due to its legitimate purposes making it harder to detect.\n\nTherefore, considering all these events together, this batch does seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activity, including the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script in the temp directory, systematic removal of files from the TEMP folder, registry modifications, and execution of whoami.exe.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that removes a file in the TEMP directory. That's already a red flag because scripts deleting files can be malicious. Next, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. These actions are common in script execution but might indicate some level of automation or potential tampering.\n\nI notice several entries where temporary PowerShell scripts are created and then deleted quickly. For example, a file is created with a specific name and immediately deleted after creation. This behavior suggests an attempt to bypass certain security policies, like script execution in the TEMP folder. Malware often does this to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where different files in the TEMP directory are being deleted via PowerShell commands. The use of the -Force parameter indicates that it's trying to remove files without user interaction, which is a tactic used by attackers to clean up traces of their activity.\n\nOther events involve processes like winlogbeat.exe and whoami.exe, which seem benign on their own, but in combination with the other activities, could be part of a larger campaign. The use of conhost.exe accessing registry values adds another layer to consider—this might be related to persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nOverall, the repeated file deletions from TEMP using PowerShell, along with script creation and deletion patterns, point towards potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has given me a batch of system events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first few entries are all from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's pretty common because Chrome often tweaks the registry for settings, so those alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry from RuntimeBroker.exe doing a registry set. Again, that doesn't immediately raise a red flag since I know RuntimeBroker is related to Windows updates and could modify the registry as part of its normal operations.\n\nNext, I see whoami.exe being executed a couple of times. Whoami is a standard system tool used to display user information. Its execution in itself isn't concerning unless it's part of a larger pattern or used maliciously, but here it seems standalone.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities. However, seeing it accessed doesn't necessarily mean something bad—it could be a legitimate admin task. But if there were malicious commands or unusual activity, that would change things.\n\nThere's also an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding logs to Elasticsearch, so this seems normal and not suspicious at all.\n\nLastly, there's a file creation by powershell.exe named pacote_ativo.txt. The filename itself doesn't indicate anything nefarious, but I should consider what the content of that file might be. Without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are normal user or system activities. The repetition of registry modifications by Chrome and RuntimeBroker is typical. While powershell.exe was accessed multiple times, without evidence of executing malicious scripts or accessing restricted resources, it doesn't seem suspicious. The use of whoami.exe also doesn't indicate foul play in this context.\n\nI don't see any events that stand out as clearly malicious or indicative of a breach when looking at the entire batch. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of unusual or harmful activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal user activities such as Chrome modifying registry settings, PowerShell being accessed, and legitimate system tools like whoami.exe and winlogbeat.exe performing their usual functions.
