{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a Chrome.exe process with a DNS query. That seems normal; users browse the web regularly, so that's not too concerning.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also common in attacks. Let me dig deeper. There are several events where powershell.exe sets registry values and loads images. The command line shows \"& {Get-Date}\", which looks like a benign script to get the current date, so maybe it's just running some system checks.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe creates temporary files, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1. Then it deletes them. This could be part of a script testing or policy enforcement, which might not be malicious but could indicate something is being checked.\n\nThere's also an event where a file named estrutura_logico.txt was created in the Downloads folder. That seems like a user saving a file, probably not suspicious unless it's related to known malware.\n\nLooking at other processes: conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are present. Conhost is typically used for console applications, so nothing wrong there. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack for log management, which is standard in monitoring setups.\n\nThe events involving registry changes with powershell could be setting up configurations, but without more context on what's being changed, it's hard to say if they're malicious. However, the repeated use of powershell and file operations might raise some flags.\n\nBut considering all events together, there isn't a clear pattern of malicious activity. Most actions seem related to normal system operations or legitimate script executions. The temporary files are created and deleted, which is part of standard processes. There's no evidence of persistence mechanisms, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as Chrome DNS queries and legitimate PowerShell operations including file creation\/deletion and registry changes. There's no evidence of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look at each event.\n\nThe first two events both involve powershell.exe. The first one shows that a registry value was set via the RegistryEvent rule, and the second indicates process access with ProcessAccess rule. PowerShell is commonly used for malicious activities, so these could be red flags. Maybe someone is trying to execute commands or modify system settings.\n\nThe third event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, but if it's creating a new .yml file, that might not be suspicious on its own unless there's an irregularity in how it's being used.\n\nLooking at the combination of events: powershell.exe with registry changes and process access could indicate malicious activity like persistence or privilege escalation. The winlogbeat event doesn't add much to the concern unless there's something else about it, but considering the other two events, this batch is definitely worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events from powershell.exe with registry and process activity, which could indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
