{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involve powershell.exe. That's a common tool for both admins and attackers, so it might be significant. There are multiple Process Create tasks for powershell.exe, which could indicate script execution. The command lines show some compressed archive commands—using Compress-Archive to create zip files in different paths.\n\nLooking further, there are several Registry value sets. This makes me think the process is modifying system configurations, which is something an attacker might do to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also a File Create and then a File Delete logged event for a .ps1 file in the TEMP directory. That script could be doing malicious things, like downloading other tools or executing commands. The fact that it creates and deletes the file quickly suggests an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are Image Load events for various DLLs related to .NET and Windows Defender. While these might seem normal, unusual loading of these modules could indicate the script is trying to hide or enhance its capabilities.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks make me think that the process is interacting with system services in a way that's not typical user activity. This could be part of an attack chain, like deploying malicious payloads or communicating with command-and-control servers.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell.exe usage with script execution, file handling, registry modifications—this looks like potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because the pattern matches common attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands and creating\/deleting files in the TEMP directory suggest potential script execution or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with command lines that involve Compress-Archive. This is a red flag because PowerShell is often used in scripting, including malicious activities. The repeated use of Compress-Archive suggests possible file compression or extraction, which could be part of an attack chain like moving files to a temporary directory.\n\nI also notice that several events show powershell.exe accessing registry values and file paths. These actions can be common in legitimate scripts but might indicate persistence mechanisms if seen in conjunction with other suspicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files. While this could be normal for log management, the specific path mentioned (winlogbeat.yml.new) seems unusual and might not be standard behavior for a typical setup. It's worth investigating whether this file creation aligns with expected configurations.\n\nThere are other processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe modifying registry values. These could be normal system operations, but they might also be part of a malicious payload trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nI'm noticing that some events don't have file paths associated, which is unusual for certain tasks. For example, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems standard, but the lack of context around other processes makes it harder to assess their intent.\n\nThe overall pattern shows multiple powershell.exe instances with similar command structures, repeated registry modifications, and non-standard file operations. These collectively suggest potential malicious activity rather than normal user behavior or legitimate script execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands, which may indicate file manipulation activities that could be malicious. Several registry access events and file operations by non-standard processes like winlogbeat.exe raise suspicion for potential persistence or privilege escalation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values and loading some system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These seem normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry and loads system components. Nothing malicious here at first glance.\n\nThen there's an entry from 'winlogbeat.exe' about creating a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so that's expected behavior. No red flags.\n\nNext, I see 'powershell.exe' being accessed twice and then 'whoami.exe' being executed. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks. The whoami command alone isn't suspicious—it just retrieves user information. Without additional indicators like unusual paths or multiple process creations, this doesn't raise an alarm.\n\nLooking at all events together, none show signs of overtly malicious activities like writing to unexpected locations, creating new files with odd names, or unusual network traffic. Each event individually is normal, and combined, there's no pattern suggesting an attack. So, I classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities including Chrome interacting with the registry and loading legitimate DLLs, Winlogbeat creating configuration files, and PowerShell\/whoami.exe being used for user information.
