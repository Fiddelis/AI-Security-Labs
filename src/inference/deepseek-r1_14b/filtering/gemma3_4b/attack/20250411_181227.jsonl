{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command lines look like they're creating scheduled tasks using PowerShell's ScheduledTask cmdlets. Each command line ends with Register-ScheduledTask followed by a different name ending in $object. This suggests that multiple new scheduled tasks are being created. These tasks are set to execute calc.exe at logon, and they have specific principals (BUILTIN\\Administrators) and run levels (Highest), which is unusual because calc.exe isn't typically used maliciously unless it's part of a payload delivery.\n\nThe fact that these tasks are being registered with different names might indicate an attempt to create multiple backdoors or persistence mechanisms. Since each task registration is a separate event, the attacker could be trying to ensure at least one of them survives detection or system reboots.\n\nLooking further, there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies registry values. Registry modifications can be part of creating persistent configurations or altering system behavior, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity. The 'Registry value set' tasks could be used to hide the presence of other activities or to alter security settings.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where powershell.exe loads various .NET framework components like mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. While PowerShell legitimately uses these DLLs, the repeated loading might be a way to check if certain modules are available or to bypass detection mechanisms by testing the environment's response.\n\nThe later events involve chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing registry values. This could be unrelated noise, especially since chrome is a common application, but it's worth keeping an eye on as sometimes browsers can be used in attacks or exfiltration activities.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of powershell.exe to create scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges is concerning. This behavior doesn't align with normal user activity and could be part of a larger attack, such as establishing persistence or deploying additional malicious payloads. The registry modifications and module loadings might be attempts to cover tracks or enhance the attack's effectiveness.\n\nI should also consider potential false positives. Could these events be from legitimate system administration tasks? While possible, the use of multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is more indicative of an attacker trying to maintain access. Moreover, the command lines in the PowerShell events are obfuscated and structured in a way that suggests automation or script execution.\n\nIn summary, this batch shows concerning activity that could indicate a breach or attack. The combination of creating malicious scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and module loading behaviors points towards potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the batch of system log events exhibits signs of potentially malicious activity. Here's the structured conclusion:\n\n### Concerning Activities Identified:\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations**: Several powershell.exe instances created multiple scheduled tasks using Register-ScheduledTask cmdlet, each set to execute calc.exe at logon with BUILTIN\\Administrators principal and Highest run level. This suggests an attempt to establish persistence or backdoor access.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Events show powershell.exe accessing and modifying registry values, which could be used to alter system configurations or hide malicious activities.\n\n3. **Module Loading Behaviors**: Powershell.exe loaded various .NET framework components, possibly testing the environment's response or attempting to bypass detection mechanisms.\n\n4. **Chrome Activity**: While less concerning on its own, chrome.exe events include pipe creation and registry modifications, which could indicate unrelated noise but worth monitoring for potential browser-related attacks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activities are indicative of a cybersecurity incident. The combination of creating malicious scheduled tasks, registry manipulations, and module loading suggests an attack aiming to maintain persistence or deploy payloads. Further investigation is recommended to assess the extent of the compromise and implement remediation strategies."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it can execute scripts and create scheduled tasks. The first event shows powershell loading MpOAV.dll, which seems legitimate since it's from Windows Defender. But then there's a file creation in a temporary directory, followed immediately by its deletion. Thatâ€™s suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are command lines where powershell.exe is used to create scheduled tasks. The commands set the task to run calc.exe at logon with admin privileges. While calc.exe itself isn't malicious, using it in a scheduled task by an unknown user could indicate persistence mechanisms typical of malware.\n\nThen, I see several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. That's normal for browser updates or settings changes, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. However, the repeated registry writes might warrant closer look, especially if they're outside of standard operations.\n\nThe latter part of the logs has multiple entries indicating \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This is concerning because remote command execution can be a sign of remote access attacks or lateral movement within a network. These events without any associated process or file context could mean an attacker executing commands on the system, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, temporary file creation and deletion, and numerous remote command executions. These actions are red flags for potential malicious activity, especially when considering the combination of multiple suspicious events from different processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including Powershell creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, temporary file creation\/deletion, and numerous remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. Hmm, I'm not sure about that one. I know that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, so maybe it's normal for system processes. But seeing it load a DLL might be something to look into.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for services, and it often interacts with the registry. But multiple registry writes in a row could be suspicious. Malware sometimes injects into these processes to hide its activities, so I should note that.\n\nThen, another event where svchost creates a file: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That seems like an unusual filename, especially \"unidade_comum\" which doesn't translate directly but might be Portuguese for something common? Not sure. Creating a file in the Tasks folder could indicate some scheduling activity, maybe malicious.\n\nMoving on, there's a process named powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry entries. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. The fact that it's creating files in user directories (like AppData) might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nI see conhost.exe also setting registry values. Conhost is usually related to console windows, so again, not sure if that's malicious or just part of normal operations.\n\nChrome.exe has several activities: loading DLLs and making registry changes. But I'm aware that Chrome can load various system files as part of its operation, so maybe that's okay. However, multiple registry writes might still be worth watching.\n\nThen, there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an ELK tool for log shipping, so if this is running on a machine, it's probably intentional. But seeing it create .yml files could indicate some misconfiguration or potential tampering.\n\nPowershell.exe again creates another file in the Downloads directory. This repetition might be part of normal script execution, but combined with other activities, it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, multiple Dns query events from Chrome. DNS queries are common, especially for browser processes to resolve domain names, so this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: several system processes like svchost and WmiPrvSE making registry changes could indicate potential compromise or persistence mechanisms. The use of PowerShell creating files in user directories is a bit concerning since attackers often abuse legitimate tools. However, without more context on the baseline behavior of these systems, it's hard to say definitively if these events are malicious.\n\nI should also consider whether these activities are within the normal operational patterns of the network. If this level of activity is unusual, especially the repeated registry writes and file creations by system processes, it might indicate something suspicious. Alternatively, it could be legitimate software updates or configuration changes.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individual events look concerning, without additional context or indicators of compromise (like known malicious IPs or hashes), the batch as a whole doesn't clearly point to an active threat. But given the potential for abuse in some of these activities, especially with svchost and PowerShell, it's worth further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nThe analysis of the log events reveals several activities that warrant attention but do not conclusively indicate malicious behavior without additional context. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **WmiPrvSE.exe and taskschd.dll:** While WmiPrvSE is a legitimate system process, loading taskschd.dll could be monitored for unusual activity.\n\n2. **svchost.exe Registry Activity:** Multiple registry writes by svchost.exe might suggest potential malicious activity, as attackers often use such processes to hide their actions.\n\n3. **File Creation by Svchost:** The creation of a file named \"unidade_comum\" in the Tasks folder is unusual and deserving of further investigation.\n\n4. **PowerShell Activity:** PowerShell's creation of files in user directories could be part of normal operations or indicate malicious scripting, making it a point of concern.\n\n5. **Conhost.exe Registry Changes:** As a console host process, conhost's registry activity should be monitored for any anomalies.\n\n6. **Chrome.exe Behavior:** While Chrome often interacts with system files and the registry, multiple writes could merit closer examination.\n\n7. **Winlogbeat Activity:** The creation of configuration files by winlogbeat.exe in non-standard locations might indicate misconfiguration or tampering.\n\n8. **Dns Queries from Chrome:** Common activity for web browsing, but worth monitoring if unexpected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events collectively suggest potential suspicious activities, particularly involving svchost.exe and PowerShell. While not definitive proof of malicious intent, they should be flagged for further investigation to ensure the integrity and security of the system."}
