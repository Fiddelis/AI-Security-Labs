Let's see what each event is telling me.\n\nThe first few events involve 'whoami.exe' being executed and then a series of PowerShell activities. Notably, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is creating processes with specific command lines that search for the word \"pass\" in various file types. This seems suspicious because it looks like a script is trying to find sensitive information.\n\nI also notice that the same PowerShell command line appears multiple times, which might indicate automated or malicious behavior. Additionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted shortly after, which could be an attempt to cover tracks. The creation of a temporary PS1 file and its subsequent deletion raises red flags about potential script execution.\n\nMoreover, the repeated 'Registry value set' tasks by powershell.exe might be attempts to modify system configurations or create persistence mechanisms. There's also an instance where 'notepad.exe' writes to the registry, which could be another attempt to change system settings without user interaction.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are several red flags pointing towards potential malicious activity, including suspicious PowerShell commands and file operations that might indicate data exfiltration or persistence attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts searching for sensitive information, along with file creation\/deletion activities indicative of potential attack behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. I'll go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell.exe loading an image. That's common for scripts but could be malicious. The second event has a command line searching for 'pass' in various files. This might indicate data theft, which is concerning.\n\nNext, svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is often used by malware because it's a legitimate process. Unusual registry changes here could mean persistence mechanisms are being set up. Then another svchost event doing the same thing—could be related or multiple components.\n\nCalculator.exe loading urlmon.dll—that seems normal unless there's something else. Moving on, findstr.exe is used in the command line searching for passwords again, similar to the PowerShell script. This repetition might suggest a data harvesting attempt.\n\nPowerShell creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That's suspicious because it could be setting up persistence across reboots. Also, another registry set by PowerShell—again, possible malicious activity.\n\nConhost.exe and other legitimate processes like ApplicationFrameHost and Calculator are modifying registry values. Unusual behavior for these processes, which might indicate they're being exploited or are part of a larger attack chain.\n\nMultiple Chrome.exe events with registry writes and DNS queries. While Chrome can do this normally, multiple such events could be part of C2 communication or data exfiltration.\n\nFinally, winlogbeat creating a file—it's an ELK component, so maybe just setting up logging, not malicious unless it's misused.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several signs that point towards potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell and findstr searching for passwords suggests data theft. Registry modifications by svchost and other processes indicate possible persistence or tampering. Multiple Chrome.exe events could be part of command and control activities. Overall, the combination of these events—especially the password searches and registry changes—makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell and other processes performing actions that may indicate malicious behavior, such as searching for sensitive data and making registry modifications.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a series of events from chrome.exe showing tasks like Image loaded and Registry value set. These seem normal because Chrome often interacts with system components. However, the multiple Network connection detections are a bit concerning—four in a row could indicate unusual activity, maybe an extension or script making several connections.\n\nNext, I notice powershell.exe creating files. The first event creates 'objeto_logico.txt', which is Portuguese for \"logical object\". That's suspicious because PowerShell is commonly used by attackers. Creating files with such names might be part of malicious activities. Additionally, there are events where PowerShell accesses processes and modifies the registry, which could be signs of lateral movement or persistence.\n\nLooking further, I see cmd.exe being used to delete scheduled tasks via schtasks. The command lines show deleting specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". These task names are in Portuguese, which is interesting. Such deletions could be attempts to remove traces of previous activities or to hide persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also schtasks.exe being used both to create and delete tasks. This might indicate an attacker setting up or disrupting scheduled tasks, which can be part of persistence strategies. The fact that the command lines are in Portuguese adds another layer—maybe indicating a geolocated attack or specific targeting.\n\nAnother event shows svchost.exe modifying the registry. Since svchost is a legitimate process but often abused by malware, this could be an indicator of malicious activity attempting to hide or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple Chrome events with network activity, PowerShell creating files and accessing processes, cmd.exe deleting tasks, and schtasks.exe being used for task manipulation—especially with non-English naming conventions—raises red flags. These activities could be part of a larger attack campaign, such as persistence, data exfiltration, or covering tracks.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell file creation with non-standard names, repeated network connections from Chrome, and cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **schtasks.exe**: This process is related to scheduling tasks in Windows. The log says the image was loaded. Schtasks is legitimate but can be abused for malicious activities like creating persistent tasks.\n\n2. **svchost.exe**: Normally a system process, but sometimes used by malware. Here, it's accessing the registry, which could indicate configuration changes—potentially malicious if combined with other events.\n\n3. **cmd.exe** and **conhost.exe**: Both are command-line tools. cmd.exe is being used in commands like deleting processes or users, which might be legitimate admin tasks but could also be signs of unauthorized access.\n\n4. **powershell.exe**: PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for execution and lateral movement. Multiple instances with different logs suggest it's being used extensively—maybe running scripts or accessing other processes.\n\n5. **whoami.exe**: Used to get user information, which can be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n6. **wmic.exe**: WMIC is another tool often misused by attackers for remote command execution and process management. The deletion commands in the command line are concerning as they might indicate efforts to cover tracks or remove traces.\n\n7. **Registry modifications**: There are several events where registry values are being set or deleted. This can be part of persistence mechanisms, creating or removing user accounts, or changing system configurations.\n\n8. **User deletions**: Commands like `net user \/del` suggest attempts to delete users, possibly administrative ones named \"componente_comum_Admin\" and others. This could indicate an attacker trying to remove traces or elevate privileges.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a sequence of activities that might be part of an attack chain:\n\n- **Initial Access**: Tools like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are used for execution.\n- **Reconnaissance**: whoami.exe is used to gather user information.\n- **Lateral Movement**: Powershell and wmic could be used to move across systems or execute commands remotely.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Deleting users might indicate attempts to remove administrative accounts or escalate privileges.\n- **Defense Evasion**: Tools like schtasks, svchost, and wmic with image loading could be signs of obfuscation or persistence techniques.\n\nThe combination of multiple tools being used, especially command-line tools known for their flexibility in both legitimate and malicious activities, raises red flags. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the deletion commands are particularly concerning as they often correlate with attacker behavior during an incident.\n\nTherefore, this batch seems relevant for further investigation because it exhibits patterns consistent with potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving command-line tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wmic.exe) and registry modifications, indicative of possible unauthorized access or malicious activities such as user deletions and process management.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs and decide if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are processes like conhost.exe and powershell.exe accessing registry values or being created. Conhost.exe is often used by legitimate applications, but sometimes malware uses it as a parent process to hide their activities. Powershell.exe is also commonly used for both good and bad purposes—scripting can be malicious.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe running, which usually isn't too suspicious on its own because it's used to check user information. But the fact that it's being called multiple times could indicate someone probing the system or trying to gather info.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is accessing processes (ProcessAccess). This might be normal admin activity, but repeated access could be a red flag, especially if combined with other actions like registry modifications.\n\nLooking further down, I notice cmd.exe being used with commands like 'net user ... \/del \/domain'. That's deleting user accounts. If these users weren't supposed to be deleted or the deletions happened without proper authorization, this could indicate malicious activity—maybe an attacker cleaning up traces of previous actions or removing user accounts for persistence.\n\nAnother cmd command is '\/c sc delete win32times', which deletes a service. Deleting services can disrupt system operations and might be part of a larger attack to disable monitoring tools or security features.\n\nThere are multiple instances where services.exe is modifying the registry, which could be related to service configurations. If these changes aren't authorized or follow an unusual pattern, they might be malicious.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with specific commands stands out. These command-line tools are often used in attacks for tasks like deleting files, terminating processes, or creating backdoors. The fact that multiple different executables (cmd, sc.exe) are being used to delete services and user accounts suggests a coordinated effort, possibly an attack.\n\nAlso, the frequency of these events is concerning. Multiple attempts to access registry values, create processes, and execute commands could indicate automated malicious scripts trying different methods to achieve their goal—maybe attempting persistence or trying to cover their tracks.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern of process creation, registry modifications, and user deletions, which are red flags for potential malicious activity. These actions don't appear to be normal user activities but rather indicative of someone with malicious intent on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of suspicious process creations and deletions, including attempts to delete user accounts and services using cmd.exe and powershell.exe.

That might seem suspicious, but it could be part of a legitimate cleanup process. However, I need to consider the entire batch.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe processes being created and accessed. PowerShell can be used for both good and malicious purposes, so that's a red flag. The command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\" seem unusual; they might indicate script execution or something more nefarious.\n\nThere are several events where files are created and then deleted by powershell.exe. This file creation and deletion in quick succession could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence mechanisms. For example, creating a script file, executing it, and then deleting it to leave no trace.\n\nAdditionally, there are registry value sets from both cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Malware often uses the registry for persistence, so these events might indicate an attempt to maintain access across reboots.\n\nThe deletion of files in the Temp directory by cmd.exe could be part of a broader cleanup routine after executing malicious scripts or tools. The repeated use of powershell.exe with unusual command lines suggests that it's being used as a tool for lateral movement, script execution, or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process creation for potentially malicious tools (cmd.exe and powershell.exe), file deletions in sensitive directories, registry modifications, and repeated attempts to create and delete files. These activities collectively indicate possible malicious behavior, such as a cyberattack or an APT campaign attempting persistence and data removal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including file deletions in the Temp directory, repeated PowerShell executions with unusual command lines, registry modifications, and file creation\/deletion cycles which may indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

First, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands.\n\nThere are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing files, creating processes, and modifying registry values. These actions could be normal administrative tasks, but they might also indicate malicious activity since persistence mechanisms often involve the registry or file creation in specific locations.\n\nI see whoami.exe being executed a few times. While this tool can be used to check user permissions, it's sometimes part of attack chains to gather information about the system. The combination with powershell.exe could suggest script-based activities that might be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries for conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry. These processes aren't typically associated with malicious activity on their own, but frequent or unusual registry modifications can be a red flag. Notepad.exe and calc.exe also show up, which seem benign unless they're part of a larger chain of events.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, if these events occurred within a short period, it might indicate coordinated activity. The repeated ProcessAccess tasks on powershell.exe could suggest an attempt to establish persistence or lateral movement.\n\nOverall, while not all events are suspicious individually, the volume and combination of activities related to powershell.exe and other tools could raise concerns about potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. So, I'm looking at a batch of system log events, each in JSONL format. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows powershell.exe being accessed. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. However, just accessing it doesn't necessarily mean anything malicious yet.\n\n2. Next, whoami.exe runs without any command-line arguments. This is commonly used to check user permissions and shouldn't be suspicious on its own unless there's an unusual context.\n\n3. Another powershell.exe access event. So this happens twice in the batch, which might raise a flag if it's not usual for the system, but again, alone, it's not conclusive.\n\n4. ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the registry. This is part of the Windows shell and is typically benign. Registry changes are common and don't usually indicate malware unless specific values change.\n\n5. Calculator.exe also accesses the registry. That's a bit unusual since calculators don't typically interact with the registry much, but I'm not sure if it's malicious or just an error. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\n6-9: There are multiple chrome.exe events involving DNS queries and network connections. Chrome is a common browser, so these activities are normal. Frequent DNS lookups could be due to browsing, and network connections are standard for web traffic. Unless they're connecting to known malicious domains or IPs, this doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together: The repeated powershell.exe accesses might warrant attention because attackers often use it for command and control or to execute scripts. However, there's no evidence of actual malicious commands being run. Similarly, the Calculator accessing the registry is odd but without further info, it's unclear. Most other events are normal user activity.\n\nI think the key here is whether these actions deviate from what's typical on this system. If powershell.exe is rarely used and suddenly accessed multiple times, that could be a red flag. But with just the given data, there's no clear indication of malicious behavior beyond possible anomalies that might not be significant enough without more context.\n\nSo, overall, while some events are a bit unusual, they don't collectively point to clear malicious activity. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING.\"\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creation, registry access, and network connections, which do not indicate malicious behavior when considered together. The repeated events like powershell.exe accesses are not inherently suspicious without additional context.\"\n}\n```"}
