{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. PowerShell can be used maliciously, so that's a red flag. It's often a tool attackers use because it has built-in encryption and can execute commands.\n\nI also notice several registry modifications. Processes like cmd.exe, reg.exe, and conhost.exe are making changes to the Windows Registry. Specifically, they're adding entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is suspicious because attackers often add registry entries to ensure their malicious scripts run on startup.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe command that adds a specific .exe file to the Run key. Similarly, reg.exe is used to modify the registry as well. These actions could be part of installing persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware to survive reboots.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is creating files, like modulo_padrao.txt. Without knowing what's inside that file, it's hard to say for sure, but combined with other events, this adds to the suspicion.\n\nThere are also some legitimate processes, like winlogbeat.exe writing configuration files, which is normal if that's a monitoring tool running. However, the repeated powershell and registry activities make me lean towards something malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple use of powershell, creating files, modifying the registry with potential persistence mechanisms, and command line arguments pointing to .exe files. This combination suggests possible malicious activity, especially since these actions are often part of attack chains.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry, along with cmd.exe and reg.exe making changes to the Run key, indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or credential dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
