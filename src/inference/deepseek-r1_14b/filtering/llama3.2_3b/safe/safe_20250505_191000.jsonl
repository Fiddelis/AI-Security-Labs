Let me go through each one to see if anything stands out.\n\nFirst event: It's the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading a file called combase.dll in System32. That seems normal since those are standard Windows processes and files.\n\nNext couple of events are about User Account Management without any process or file info. Those could be routine logins or group policy changes, nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's an event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a new config file. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect logs, so it makes sense for it to create configuration files.\n\nAfter that, Excel is launching with a specific command line pointing to real_values.csv. That could be a user opening a spreadsheet; nothing wrong there unless the filename is suspicious, but \"real_values\" sounds benign.\n\nAnother winlogbeat event doing something similar, which I've already considered normal.\n\nExcel loads urlmon.dll from System32—again, standard for web-related functionality in Excel, so no issue here.\n\nA WmiPrvSE.exe process loading wmiutils.dll. Those are related to WMI and system management, which is usual activity.\n\nThere's a Special Logon event without details—it might be a service or user logging on remotely, but nothing unusual unless there's an associated breach attempt, which I don't see here.\n\nMore User Account Management events, still routine.\n\nExcel creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder for real_values.csv. Shortcuts are normal and part of Windows functionality.\n\nAn event with task \"None\" from process null—could be something ignored or not logged, probably nothing to worry about.\n\nLastly, Excel making a DNS query. This might be checking for online resources or updates, which is common behavior for applications needing network access.\n\nPutting it all together: All events seem within normal operational parameters. There's no indication of unusual file accesses, multiple failed logins, or processes that don't belong. No signs of malicious activities like process injection, unauthorized file creation, or network anomalies beyond standard Excel functionality. Therefore, this batch isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are routine system activities including process creations, file operations, and user account management, with no signs of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
