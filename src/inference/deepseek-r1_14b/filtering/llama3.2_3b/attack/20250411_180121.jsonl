{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm looking at a batch of events where multiple processes are being tracked. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because Chrome often connects to the internet.\n\nThen, I notice several powershell.exe entries with different command lines. Each one has a download file operation pointing to GitHub repositories. This makes me pause because downloading files from GitHub could be part of legitimate script execution, but it might also be malicious. The repeated use of WebClient's DownloadFile method is a red flag since attackers often use this technique.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple FileCreate and FileDelete events related to .ps1 scripts in the Temp directory. This behavior suggests that the PowerShell scripts are being created and then deleted, possibly to avoid detection or to execute some actions before deletion.\n\nAnother point is the RegistryEvent tasks from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome might update registry settings normally, seeing this alongside other suspicious activities could indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe ImageLoad events in powershell.exe are also notable. Loading specific DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll might be part of legitimate operations, but combined with the other actions, they could signify code injection or execution of malicious scripts.\n\nLastly, the Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks under powershell.exe aren't common in typical usage. These might relate to the script's execution phases, which again raises concern about what the script is doing on the system.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple network connections, file downloads, script creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and DLL loads—it feels like there's a coordinated effort that could be malicious. The repetitive patterns across different processes and events make it more likely than not that this batch is worth investigating for potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple network connection attempts, file downloads from GitHub using PowerShell, and registry modifications.

Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being executed with commands that download files from GitHub. The command line shows `powershell.exe` downloading `LICENSE.txt` into the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because downloading files from arbitrary websites can indicate malicious activity or data exfiltration.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of file creations and registry modifications. For example, when PowerShell creates files in different paths like `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`, it might be setting up persistence mechanisms or creating temporary files for malicious operations. The use of registry edits (like deleting or adding entries) is also concerning because attackers often modify the registry to maintain access or hide their tracks.\n\nI see processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` being used to delete registry keys related to scheduled tasks (`schtasks`) and startup items. This could be an attempt to remove traces of previous activities or clean up after executing some malicious scripts. The command lines show operations like deleting entries from `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`, which is a common spot for persistence mechanisms. Removing such keys might mean they're trying to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of `conhost.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`. While these are legitimate processes, their association with registry changes and other activities here could indicate they're being misused as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a sequence of events that suggest an attacker is attempting to:\n\n1. Download potentially malicious files.\n2. Create temporary files on the system.\n3. Modify the registry to delete traces or create persistence points.\n4. Use legitimate tools (like cmd.exe and reg.exe) for malicious purposes.\n\nThe high number of PowerShell executions with varying command lines also stands out. Malware often uses PowerShell due to its scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands that can bypass some security measures.\n\nIn summary, the combination of file downloads from external sources, registry modifications, deletion of system entries, and repeated use of powerful tools like PowerShell points towards potential malicious activity. This batch shows signs of an attack vector being set up or executed, which makes it highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe downloading files from external sources, registry modifications, and deletions, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events involve powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET components, so that doesn't raise red flags immediately. Then there's a file creation by PowerShell in the temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest with different extensions. This could be part of script testing or configuration checks.\n\nNext, I see several events where powershell.exe creates pipes and interacts with registry values. Registry modifications can be suspicious, but they're also common for legitimate configurations. There are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' by PowerShell, which might indicate some script is running and making changes to the system settings.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line showing \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like it's just invoking PowerShell without executing any code in that instance. That doesn't immediately look malicious but could be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThere's an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often used by scripts to interact with the console, so this might not be unusual unless combined with other activities. Similarly, whoami.exe being run isn't suspicious on its own; it's commonly used for debugging or user information checks.\n\nMultiple events show cmd.exe being called with \"\/c\", which typically means it will execute a command and then terminate. The command line here is just \"cmd.exe \/c\" without any attached command, so again, not immediately concerning but worth keeping an eye on if part of a larger pattern.\n\nI notice that several events are related to Windows Defender components (MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll) being loaded by PowerShell. This could be part of legitimate system operations or possibly an attempt to disable or manipulate antivirus features, which would be a red flag.\n\nThe repeated occurrences of the same processes and tasks make me think there's either automated script execution or some form of persistence mechanism. The creation of temporary files in the user's AppData folder with random-looking names could indicate script testing or attempts to bypass certain security policies.\n\nWhile individual events don't point to clear malicious activity, the combination—especially the repeated registry modifications and loading of antivirus components—could be part of a broader attack vector. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell for persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The use of multiple temporary files might be attempts to test system configurations or create decoys.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive, these activities are worth monitoring closely. They could indicate legitimate system administration tasks but also have potential signs of malicious behavior, especially the interaction with antivirus components and repeated process creations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events involves numerous instances of powershell.exe loading legitimate .NET libraries and creating temporary files in the user's AppData folder. The creation of these files might be part of script testing or configuration checks. Additionally, there are multiple registry modifications by powershell.exe, which could indicate legitimate configuration changes but also raise concerns if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nThe repeated command line calls to \"powershell.exe & {}\" suggest potential script execution attempts. While not immediately malicious on their own, they could be part of a larger attack strategy. The events involving conhost.exe and cmd.exe might be unrelated or indicative of legitimate system operations but should be monitored for context.\n\nGiven the combination of activities, including temporary file creation and registry modifications, there's a possibility of potential security concerns. These could indicate attempts to manipulate system settings or load malicious components, though no definitive evidence of such activity is present in the logs provided."}

I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here. The first thing that stands out is multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with commands like Remove-Item, which deletes files in specific paths under the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activities to clean up traces.\n\nLooking closer, some events show attempts to delete .zip and .txt files in the TEMP folder. These file extensions make me think they might have been used for dropping malware or other malicious payloads before deletion. The fact that ErrorAction is set to Ignore suggests that the user wants to suppress any errors, which is a common tactic in scripts meant to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework components and Windows Defender files. While these aren't inherently bad, they could be part of the PowerShell process loading necessary modules or trying to mimic legitimate behavior while hiding malicious activities.\n\nI also notice that there's a creation and deletion of a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 in the TEMP directory. This seems like it might be related to script policy testing, but the rapid creation and deletion is concerning because attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting logs or scripts they use.\n\nAnother point is the process accessed events and registry value sets. These could indicate that the script is attempting to gather information or modify system configurations, which are red flags for potential malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe execution. While whoami itself isn't malicious, its execution alongside other suspicious activities might be part of an attempt to gather user information or privileges.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like the batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior, such as deleting files to cover tracks and executing scripts that could be harmful. The repetitive nature of the file deletions in specific paths under TEMP adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to definitively say this is an attack. But given the combination of PowerShell activities aimed at modifying or deleting system files and temporary resources, along with attempts to suppress errors, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to delete files in the TEMP directory, including attempts to remove .zip and .txt files.
