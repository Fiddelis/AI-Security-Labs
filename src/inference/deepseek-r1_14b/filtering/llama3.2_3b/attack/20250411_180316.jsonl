{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved, there are several instances where PowerShell is being used. That's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and lateral movement. But let's see what exactly is happening with each PowerShell instance.\n\nI notice that many of the PowerShell events have tasks like 'Process accessed' or 'Registry value set.' These actions can be part of legitimate administration, but they might also indicate malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point is the use of command-line arguments. For example, there's a cmd.exe command deleting a task using schtasks. That could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities by deleting scheduled tasks. Additionally, there are processes like 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'svchost.exe,' which can be legitimate but sometimes used in attacks.\n\nI also see multiple instances where the same commands are repeated, such as running whoami.exe or using cmd.exe with specific copy and delete commands. This repetition might suggest a script is being run multiple times, which could be part of automated malicious activities.\n\nLooking at file interactions, some processes load 'urlmon.dll,' which can be related to URL handling but also sometimes used in attacks for certain functionalities. The fact that both calc.exe and WMIC.exe are loading this DLL adds to the suspicion.\n\nMoreover, there's a cmd.exe command trying to copy an executable from one location to another (sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe). This could be an attempt to replace system binaries, which is a common technique in malware for persistence.\n\nThe use of schtasks to delete tasks and the repeated process creations with various commands make me think that this batch shows signs of potential attack stages: initial access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. The combination of these events across multiple processes increases the concern about malicious activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities, while not all inherently malicious, collectively present a pattern that is commonly associated with cyberattacks. However, I should ensure there's no benign justification for such behavior.\n\nBut wait, some of these could be normal user activity if, for example, an admin is performing system maintenance. The line between normal and suspicious can be thin here. Still, the frequency and combination of high-risk activities like PowerShell usage, file copying, task deletion, and repeated process creations make me more confident that this batch warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activities including unusual PowerShell commands, file operations, and deletions of system tasks which may indicate an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that could be something to watch. Then there's cmd.exe being created but with an empty command line, which seems odd because usually you'd expect some commands after \/c.\n\nNext, another instance of cmd.exe setting a registry value again. That repetition might not be normal user activity. Moving on, powershell.exe accessing processes and loading various images like mscoree.dll and others from the .NET framework. Loading multiple DLLs could be part of legitimate script execution, but it's also something attackers might do to hide their tracks.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe is loading different system files, which isn't inherently bad but could indicate some scripting activity. Then there's a file creation event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. Creating scripts in temp folders can be suspicious, especially if they're not user-initiated.\n\nMultiple events with command lines pointing to powershell.exe with specific paths checked via Test-Path. These look like exit codes based on whether certain files exist. This could be part of a setup routine or persistence mechanism, which is concerning because attackers often use such checks to ensure their scripts run correctly after system reboots.\n\nAnother process creation event for winlogbeat.exe creating a config file. That's more normal if it's an agent running, but I should check the context of that process. The repetition of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events with powershell.exe might indicate some sort of service or script starting up multiple times, which could be part of a larger campaign.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are several red flags: repeated registry modifications, creation of temp scripts, multiple checks for specific files which might be used as persistence markers. The use of PowerShell in different ways and the empty command lines in cmd.exe executions make me think this could be an APT or sophisticated attack trying to establish a presence.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these events are related, but the combination points towards potential malicious activity. I should flag this for further investigation, maybe check the timestamps of these events to see if they're part of a coordinated sequence. Also, looking into the exact command lines and what files they're interacting with would be crucial to confirm if it's an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe modifying registry values could indicate efforts to persist or alter system configurations, a common tactic in attacks.\n\n2. **Cmd.exe Activity**: The creation of cmd.exe processes with empty command lines is unusual and may suggest command injection or setup for subsequent malicious actions.\n\n3. **DLL Loading**: Powershell.exe loading various system DLLs might be part of legitimate scripting but could also mask malicious activities, such as lateral movement or payload deployment.\n\n4. **Temp Script Creation**: The creation of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory raises suspicions, as attackers often use temp files for temporary storage or execution of scripts.\n\n5. **File Existence Checks**: Powershell.exe checking for specific files using Test-Path could be part of a persistence mechanism, ensuring malicious scripts run after system reboots.\n\n6. **Provider Lifecycle Events**: The repetition of these events with powershell.exe might indicate multiple attempts to start services or scripts, potentially as part of an attack sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**: These events collectively suggest possible malicious activity, likely from an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Further investigation is recommended, including correlating timestamps and analyzing command lines for indicators of compromise."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The first few entries show that powershell.exe accessed a file and then created it in the user's temporary directory. That could be suspicious because creating files in temp directories might indicate malicious activity like dropping files or scripts.\n\nNext, there are events where files are deleted immediately after being created. For example, __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then deleted. This quick file lifecycle might suggest an attempt to avoid detection by not leaving traces on disk.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some events, I notice commands like New-Item and Set-Content being used to create files and set their contents. These are standard PowerShell cmdlets but often misused by attackers to write malicious scripts or batch files. The paths mentioned, such as \"C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\\" and similar, seem arbitrary, which is a red flag because legitimate software usually doesn't create files in such unpredictable locations.\n\nThere are also entries where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. While this might seem normal, attackers sometimes load malicious modules or bypass security by using legitimate processes to execute their code.\n\nAnother point of concern is the repetitive nature of these events. The same patterns repeat with slight variations in file paths and command structures. This repetition could indicate automated script execution, which is common in attacks to distribute malware or establish persistence across multiple systems.\n\nI should also consider the context of each event. Are these occurring during user activity, or are they happening at unusual times? Without additional timestamps or process information, it's hard to say, but the volume and nature of these events raise suspicion.\n\nIn summary, while some activities could be legitimate (like using PowerShell for system administration), the combination of file creation\/deletion in temp directories, arbitrary paths, repeated script execution commands, and the use of powershell.exe with such patterns is concerning. These behaviors align with common tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence, execute payloads, or move laterally within a network.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Instances**: The frequent execution of powershell.exe is notable, as attackers often use it for scripting and lateral movement.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**: Files are created in temporary directories and immediately deleted, which may indicate an attempt to avoid disk-based detection mechanisms.\n\n3. **Arbitrary File Paths**: Scripts are being written to unusual locations, a tactic often used by attackers to evade standard security monitoring practices.\n\n4. **Repetitive Command Patterns**: The consistent use of New-Item and Set-Content cmdlets with varying file paths suggests automated or malicious script execution.\n\n5. **DLL Loading from Legitimate Processes**: Powershell.exe loading DLLs like MpClient.dll could be an attempt to bypass detection by leveraging legitimate processes for malicious activities.\n\n**Conclusion**: While some activities might be legitimate, the combination of behaviors points towards potential attacker tactics such as persistence, payload delivery, or lateral movement. This batch of logs warrants further investigation to assess the risk and confirm whether a security incident has occurred."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe and whoami.exe. I know that PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The fact that it's creating files and accessing processes makes me think about possible lateral movement or persistence mechanisms. \n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them are checking if certain files exist. For example, they're testing paths like \"C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base\\bin\\entrada_base.exe\". This behavior could be part of a script trying to verify file presence, which might indicate an attacker checking if their malicious payloads are in place or attempting to bypass some security measures.\n\nThere's also a File Delete event for a PowerShell script test file. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up traces after malicious activities. The fact that it's deleting a .ssp.ps1 file suggests it's related to PowerShell Script Policy testing, which could be an attempt to disable certain security features or run unsigned scripts.\n\nThe events with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks make me think about how the script is initializing and managing resources within PowerShell. This might not be inherently malicious but combined with other behaviors, it could indicate a more complex script execution.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe to execute commands. The command line \"\/c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\objeto_logico.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )\" checks if a specific file exists in the Temp directory. This kind of check can be part of a larger script to ensure certain files are present before proceeding with more malicious actions.\n\nI notice that there are multiple Process Create events for whoami.exe and powershell.exe, which could indicate process spawning or testing user privileges. Whoami is often used to get system information, which might help in identifying the current user context, useful for lateral movement.\n\nThe Image Load events load various DLLs, which is normal for processes but can sometimes be used to hide malicious activities within legitimate processes. The specific DLLs like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll are part of .NET framework, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with command-line arguments checking file existence, deleting script-related files, and using cmd.exe to check for specific files suggests a possible malicious script trying to establish persistence or perform some tasks. The repeated Process Access events could indicate lateral movement within a network or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nHowever, I should consider that these actions might also be from legitimate scripts performing system checks. But the use of multiple process creations and file deletions leans more towards potential malicious activity. The variety of commands and the specific paths being checked don't seem to align with standard administrative tasks, which usually involve more predictable commands.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:** The logs show numerous instances where powershell.exe is executed. This raises suspicion because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and lateral movement.\n\n2. **File Existence Checks:** Command-line arguments in the logs indicate that scripts are checking if specific files exist. This behavior can be part of malicious activities to ensure payloads are present or to bypass security measures.\n\n3. **File Deletion Event:** A file deletion event targets a PowerShell script test file, suggesting an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious scripts.\n\n4. **Process Creation and Access:** Multiple Process Create events for whoami.exe and powershell.exe, along with numerous Process Access events, could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\n5. **Command Execution via cmd.exe:** The use of cmd.exe to check for specific files adds another layer of potential malicious activity, possibly part of a larger script to execute commands conditionally based on file presence.\n\n6. **Image Load Events:** While these are normal for processes, the specific DLLs loaded might hint at activities within legitimate processes that could be hiding malicious actions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of behaviors observed—executing PowerShell scripts with specific file checks, deleting related files, and using cmd.exe to verify file presence—indicates a high likelihood of potential malicious activity. These actions are indicative of script execution for persistence or lateral movement, making the log events worthy of further investigation into possible security threats.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits behaviors that suggest potential malicious activity, including multiple PowerShell executions with file checks and deletions, as well as command execution via cmd.exe. Therefore, these logs are deemed **interesting** for cybersecurity analysis.\n\n**Answer:** The logs are interesting due to signs of possible malicious activity involving PowerShell and file operations."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: It's the whoami.exe process being created. That seems pretty normal because users often run this command to check their permissions or see who they are logged in as. Nothing malicious jumps out here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things. I need to look at how it's being used. The command line has a Test-Path check on some file paths. That looks like it's trying to see if specific files exist. If the files are there, it exits with 0; otherwise, 1. This might be part of some script checking for certain conditions.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is being created and accessed. Each time, the command line varies slightly but seems similar in structure, all involving Test-Path commands on different file paths. This repetition makes me think it's a script running multiple checks across various locations, possibly trying to verify if certain files or directories exist.\n\nI notice that some events are about image loading, which is normal when processes start up and load necessary libraries. Others mention Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle, which again seem like standard PowerShell operations during startup or script execution.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for a .ps1 script in the Temp directory, followed immediately by its deletion. This could be part of a script checking permissions or trying to avoid detection. Deleting the script after use might indicate an attempt to hide activity, which raises some flags.\n\nAlso, several events show powershell.exe accessing various system files and components like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These are related to Windows Defender, so it's possible that the script is interacting with antivirus components, maybe trying to bypass detection or check if certain features are enabled.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell instances running scripts that check for file existence across different directories. The repeated use of Test-Path and the creation\/deletion of temporary scripts suggest automated behavior. While not conclusive on their own, these patterns could be part of a larger script testing system configurations or possibly indicating malicious activity like footprinting or lateral movement.\n\nThe justification is based on the repetitive nature of the commands, especially the Test-Path checks across different paths. The deletion of the temporary script adds to the suspicion as it might be an attempt to cover tracks. Given that these actions don't have a clear benign purpose, they warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:** Review each event for processes and file interactions. Notably, multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are created with command lines involving `Test-Path` on various file paths.\n\n2. **Identify Patterns:** The repetitive use of similar commands in different events suggests a script running automated checks across the system.\n\n3. **Flag Suspicious Actions:** Temporary file creation followed by deletion indicates an attempt to hide activity, which is often seen in malicious scripts.\n\n4. **Consider Context:** While individual actions can be benign, their combination (multiple checks and file manipulation) raises concerns about potential malicious intent or unauthorized access.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events shows multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running commands that check for the existence of files across various directories. The repetitive use of `Test-Path` and the creation\/deletion of a temporary script suggest automated behavior, possibly indicating malicious activity such as footprinting or attempting to bypass security measures. These actions don't have a clear benign purpose, making them suspicious.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe events are classified as **interesting**, warranting further investigation due to the combination of repetitive PowerShell commands and file manipulations that could indicate malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. There are 19 events here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them involve powershell.exe being executed with command lines that check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts in various paths. For example:\n- C:\\tarefa_geral\\unidade_logico\\tarefa_logico\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n- C:\\pacote_temporario\\tarefa_geral\\objeto_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n\nThis repeated pattern suggests that the script is being checked multiple times across different directories. This could indicate an attempt to locate and execute a malicious script, possibly for keylogging or other malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe creates temporary files in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for executing scripts without leaving traces easily visible in the main directory.\n\nOther notable points:\n- The process whoami.exe is run a couple of times. While whoami is usually benign, when combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of privilege escalation or information gathering.\n- There are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses and loads various DLLs, which is normal but might be part of a larger attack chain.\n- Several events show that the same script paths are being checked repeatedly, suggesting persistence attempts.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities align with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as script execution, file creation in temporary directories, and repeated checks for malicious scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nThe first few events show svchost.exe and chrome.exe making network connections. That doesn't immediately raise a red flag because these processes are common and can have legitimate reasons to connect to networks. Maybe the system is just updating or communicating with servers.\n\nThen, there's a series of events related to powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both for good and bad purposes, so this catches my attention. The tasks listed include process access, registry value sets, image loading, pipe creation, and file operations. Specifically, I see multiple RegistryEvent tasks where values are being set. That could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the command line in some events, there's a script executing commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. These are directory listing commands, but when chained together, they might be part of a larger script intended to traverse directories deeply. This kind of activity could be part of data collection or reconnaissance.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file named estrutura_secundario.txt in the user's Downloads folder by powershell.exe. The naming suggests it's secondary structure, maybe storing some configuration or collected data. It might not be malicious on its own, but combined with other actions, it could be part of exfiltration or data manipulation.\n\nThere are also events where winlogbeat.exe creates a YAML file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and isn't inherently suspicious unless misused. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new seems normal, possibly during an update or configuration change.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of powershell.exe events with varied activities is concerning. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks could be setting up persistence points so that the script runs again on system startup, which is a common tactic in malware. Additionally, multiple file creation and process access events suggest active manipulation of the system state.\n\nThe command-line scripts using 'ls -recurse' might be part of a larger script designed to gather information across the network or local drives. Such deep traversal could indicate data collection activities, possibly leading up to exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here where powershell.exe is performing multiple system-level operations that don't have an obvious legitimate purpose in this context. The combination of registry modifications, file creation, and directory traversal suggests potential malicious activity, such as persistence, data collection, or lateral movement within a network.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities are unusual and could indicate malicious behavior. My confidence is high, maybe around 0.95, since there's a clear pattern of powershell.exe performing multiple potentially suspicious actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including registry modifications and file operations, which could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence or data collection.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
