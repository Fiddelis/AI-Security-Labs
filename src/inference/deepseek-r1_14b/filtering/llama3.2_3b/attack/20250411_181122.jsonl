Let's go through each event one by one and see what they indicate.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's a PowerShell process creation where the command line contains some search strings looking for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. This immediately catches my attention because searching for passwords in files could be malicious activity. It might be an attempt to find sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the next few events, there are multiple Image Load and File Create tasks from powershell.exe. These seem normal as PowerShell often loads various DLLs when running scripts. However, combined with the initial command line, it's suspicious because it shows a lot of activity from the same process.\n\nThen I see several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but given that there are multiple such events repeating, it might indicate something is wrong or unusual in the script's behavior.\n\nFurther down, there's an event where a file is created by powershell.exe at a specific path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\estrutura_ativo.txt. This could be writing to a file on disk, which might be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts. It's another red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving findstr.exe searching for \"pass\" in files and whoami.exe being executed. These seem like they could be parts of an attack chainâ€”using whoami to gather system information and findstr to search for passwords.\n\nOn the other hand, there are normal processes like notepad.exe accessing registry values, chrome.exe making network connections, and winlogbeat creating log files, which are expected and don't indicate anything suspicious on their own. However, these should be considered against the backdrop of the potentially malicious PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple events from powershell.exe with command lines that search for sensitive information, repeated provider lifecycle changes, file creations in user directories, and other auxiliary tools like findstr and whoami suggest a possible attack or unauthorized access. These activities don't appear to be part of normal system operations and could indicate an ongoing security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious PowerShell processes searching for sensitive information, repeated provider lifecycle events, file creations in user directories, and auxiliary tool executions, indicating potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of process creations and deletions. For example, there are multiple entries where cmd.exe is creating tasks using schtasks \/delete. This looks like someone is removing scheduled tasks. They're deleting \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". These names seem a bit generic, but maybe they're related to some system or user-specific tasks.\n\nThen there are instances of whoami.exe being run. That's usually used to get user information, which is common for legitimate scripts, but could also be part of malicious activity to check permissions or gather info.\n\nLooking at WMIC.exe calls, I notice it's loading various DLLs like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. WMIC can be used for remote command execution, and sometimes attackers use it to bypass certain security features. The fact that it's accessing these DLLs might be part of legitimate system management or could be malicious activity.\n\nThere are also several PowerShell.exe processes being accessed and having registry changes. PowerShell is powerful and often used by both admins and attackers. The process accesses and sets registry values, which can be normal but could also indicate configuration changes for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nI see net.exe and net1.exe deleting user accounts like \"componente_comum_Admin\" and others. Deleting user accounts can be part of system cleanup, but it's suspicious if done without proper authorization, especially in bulk or via scripts.\n\nConhost.exe is involved in some events too. Conhost is often used by scripts to interact with the console, but seeing it alongside registry changes might be a red flag if it's not expected behavior.\n\nThere are file deletions happening, such as deleting files from the Temp directory, like \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\". Deleting temporary files could be part of cleaning up after malicious activity or just regular script cleanup. The specific names here seem to include 'calc' which is a common benign example, but in this case, it's being deleted, so it might not be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple process creations and deletions, modifications to the registry, deletion of user accounts, and file removals. These actions, especially when done via command-line tools like cmd.exe and PowerShell, could indicate someone cleaning up traces or attempting to remove persistence mechanisms. The use of schtasks and services.exe for task management might be part of a larger script aiming to maintain access or cover tracks.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of data exfiltration or immediate damage, but the combination of these activities over multiple events suggests potential malicious behavior aimed at system configuration changes and cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows a sequence of potentially malicious activities including task deletion, user account removal, and file deletions, which may indicate efforts to clean up traces of an attack or establish persistence.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is conhost.exe with a registry value set. Conhost is usually related to console windows, but seeing it in the logs might not be too unusual unless there's something else going on.\n\nNext up are several whoami.exe executions. Whoami is a legitimate system tool used to get user information. However, multiple instances could raise an eyebrow, especially if they're running without clear context or at odd times.\n\nThen there's a series of powershell.exe events. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The repeated calls here are concerning, especially when combined with other actions like file creation and registry modifications.\n\nLooking deeper into the PowerShell events: I see instances where files are being created in temporary directories, which could be a sign of script execution or persistence mechanisms. There's also a mention of StartupProfileData, which might indicate attempts to modify user profiles or execute scripts at startup.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the repeated Engine Lifecycle tasks for powershell.exe. This could suggest that PowerShell is being used in a way that requires multiple instances or long-running processes, which is common in malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are some registry value sets by both conhost and powershell, which might be part of persistence techniques to maintain access across reboots.\n\nOn the other hand, notepad.exe and calc.exe events seem normal. They're common applications, but I notice that even these have tasks like ImageLoad and RegistryEvent, which aren't inherently suspicious on their own unless there's an unusual volume or context.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe executions with file creation, registry changes, and process accesses are red flags. The repeated whoami.exe might be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance. The combination of these activities suggests potential malicious behavior, such as script execution, persistence setup, and information gathering.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and repeated process creations. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I've got three JSONL events here that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, let's break down each event:\n\n1. The first event is about the process \"whoami.exe\" being executed with the command line pointing to its default location in C:\\Windows\\system32\\. The Windows log task here is Process Create, which means a new instance of whoami.exe was created. Whoami is typically used to display user information, so it's common for legitimate use.\n\n2. The second event involves \"powershell.exe\" being accessed. The task is labeled as Process Access, which could mean various things like opening or interacting with the process. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both benignly and maliciously, but without more context, it's hard to say if this access is suspicious.\n\n3. The third event is about \"chrome.exe\" making a DNS query. This seems normal since browsers regularly perform DNS lookups to navigate to websites. No red flags here at first glance.\n\nLooking at these together, the processes involved are whoami, PowerShell, and Chrome. While PowerShell could be concerning due to its potential misuse, the other two seem routine. There's no indication of any malicious activities like multiple failed logins, unexpected file accesses, or network anomalies that would raise eyebrows.\n\nI should consider if there's any pattern or combination that might suggest foul play. For example, if whoami.exe was followed by a command to elevate privileges or modify system settings, that would be more concerning. But in this case, each event is isolated and within normal user activitiesâ€”running whoami, accessing PowerShell for legitimate tasks (like scripting), and Chrome browsing the internet.\n\nAdditionally, since none of these events show signs of failure or unusual timing (like occurring outside business hours), there's no immediate cause for alarm. The system logs don't indicate any attempts to access restricted resources or establish unauthorized connections.\n\nIn conclusion, while each event on its own could warrant a closer look under certain circumstances, when taken together as a batch, they don't present a cohesive pattern of malicious behavior. Therefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification that highlights the lack of indicators of compromise and their alignment with normal user activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity including system identification (whoami.exe), PowerShell access, and Chrome DNS queries. No indication of malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
