{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used in both legitimate scripts and malicious activities. So that immediately catches my attention.\n\nLooking closer, the command line arguments in some of these powershell.exe processes have a script trying to search for files containing \"pass\" using findstr and select-string with patterns like \"*.xml\", \"*.doc\", etc. This seems suspicious because it's looking for common keywords related to passwords or sensitive information. That kind of activity could indicate someone is trying to harvest credentials or sensitive data.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe creates temporary files, specifically a .ps1 script in the temp directory which gets created and then deleted quickly. The file creation and deletion might be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on disk. This behavior is often seen in malware or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nAdditionally, there's activity related to registry modifications and loading of various DLLs. Powershell scripts can do a lot with the system, including persistence mechanisms through the registry. The fact that multiple events show registry changes adds to the suspicion because attackers often use registry keys for persistence or to alter system configurations.\n\nI also see some process creations like Calculator.exe and findstr.exe, which might be innocent, but in combination with other suspicious activities could be part of a larger attack chain. For example, using legitimate tools in an attack can help avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the repeated command line arguments in several powershell.exe events. This repetition suggests automated or script-driven behavior, possibly indicative of malicious activity trying different approaches to achieve its goal.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—suspicious command-line arguments searching for sensitive data, quick file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and repetitive script execution—it's highly likely that this batch of logs indicates malicious behavior. Therefore, it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing suspicious commands searching for sensitive data patterns, combined with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because Chrome usually doesn't change the registry much. Maybe it's related to some extension or setting? But doing this multiple times in a row makes me wonder if it's part of a larger process.\n\nThen, another event shows that chrome.exe is querying the DNS. That could be normal if it's trying to navigate somewhere, but I don't have context on what URL it's looking up.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. That seems like part of its normal operation—updating config files or logs. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's expected behavior when running scripts or extensions that might need anti-malware checks.\n\nThere's a network connection detected by chrome.exe. Again, could be part of normal browsing activity unless the destination is known malicious.\n\nAnother set of registry writes from chrome.exe adds to my earlier thought—maybe it's trying to persist some settings, but I'm not sure if that's common for Chrome.\n\nLooking further down, there are events from powershell.exe creating files. The file path ends with \"estrutura_ativo.txt\", which translates to something like \"active structure\". That could be part of legitimate script execution, but PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands.\n\nThere are several process creations involving schtasks.exe and cmd.exe. Schtasks is for scheduling tasks, so deleting existing tasks might be normal admin activity or part of a cleanup routine. The command lines show deleting specific task names, which could be legitimate if an admin is cleaning up old tasks.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe running a wmic process to delete notepad.exe instances. That seems odd because why would you want to delete notepad processes? Maybe it's trying to remove traces or prevent debugging tools from being used.\n\nAlso, the use of whoami.exe and conhost.exe doesn't immediately raise red flags but could be part of privilege escalation or persistence techniques if they're being used in a specific way.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple registry writes by Chrome, which is uncommon; file creation by PowerShell with a suspicious name; process creations and deletions using schtasks and cmd, possibly deleting system tools. These could indicate someone trying to maintain persistence on the system or perform malicious activities like disabling security features or deleting logs.\n\nThe repeated use of command-line tools and scripts might suggest scripting activity, which is often used in attacks for automation. Also, the deletion of scheduled tasks and processes could be an attempt to cover tracks or remove competing malware.\n\nSo putting it all together, there are several red flags: unexpected registry changes, file creation by potentially malicious scripts, process deletions that seem excessive, and use of tools commonly associated with attacks. This batch might indicate some level of compromise or at least suspicious activity worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the provided logs, here's a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Multiple Registry Writes by Chrome.exe:**\n   - **Observation:** chrome.exe writes to the registry multiple times in succession.\n   - **Analysis:** Unusual behavior for Chrome, which typically doesn't modify the registry frequently. This could indicate an extension, setting change, or potential malicious activity.\n\n2. **DNS Query and Network Connection:**\n   - **Observation:** chrome.exe initiates a DNS query and establishes a network connection.\n   - **Analysis:** Could be part of normal browsing but without context, it's hard to determine if the destination is malicious.\n\n3. **File Creation by Winlogbeat.exe:**\n   - **Observation:** winlogbeat creates a file in its directory.\n   - **Analysis:** Likely part of normal operation for log management; not suspicious on its own.\n\n4. **Loading Defender DLLs:**\n   - **Observation:** chrome.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll.\n   - **Analysis:** Legitimate Windows processes, expected behavior when handling scripts or extensions.\n\n5. **Registry Writes from Various Processes:**\n   - **Observation:** cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and others write to the registry.\n   - **Analysis:** Could be part of legitimate admin tasks or malicious activity like persistence mechanisms.\n\n6. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Observation:** powershell.exe creates a file named \"estrutura_ativo.txt\".\n   - **Analysis:** PowerShell is commonly used in attacks due to its scripting power. The filename suggests it might be creating a structure or list, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\n7. **Process Creation and Deletion:**\n   - **Observation:** schtasks.exe and cmd.exe delete scheduled tasks and processes.\n   - **Analysis:** Could be legitimate admin activity but may also indicate an attacker cleaning up traces or removing competing malware.\n\n8. **Deletion of Notepad Processes:**\n   - **Observation:** cmd.exe uses wmic to delete notepad.exe instances.\n   - **Analysis:** Unusual behavior; deleting system tools could be part of an attack to prevent debugging or logging.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n- **Unexpected Registry Changes:** Multiple writes by Chrome and other processes suggest possible persistence mechanisms.\n- **Suspicious File Creation:** PowerShell creating a file with a possibly malicious name raises concern.\n- **Excessive Process Management:** Deleting system tasks and processes could be an attempt to cover tracks or disable security features.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe logs indicate suspicious activity that may suggest a potential security compromise. Indicators include unusual registry modifications, file creation by scripts commonly used in attacks, and process deletions possibly aimed at evading detection. Further investigation is recommended to determine the extent of any compromise."}

Let me start by looking at each event one by one and then see if there's a pattern or something malicious.\n\nFirst event: WMIC.exe loading amsi.dll. That seems normal because amsi is related to anti-malware scanning, so the system might be checking files when they're loaded.\n\nSecond event: WMIC.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Again, that's expected since Defender uses these modules for protection.\n\nNext few events involve powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing registry values or being created with commands. For example, cmd.exe deleting user accounts like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting users isn't inherently bad, but it might indicate someone cleaning up after an attack or setting permissions.\n\nLooking further, I see multiple instances of net.exe, net1.exe, and cmd.exe deleting various user accounts. The command lines show different usernames being deleted, which could be part of a cleanup process by malware trying to remove traces or legitimate admin tasks.\n\nThere are events where whoami.exe is run, which is often used to check the current user's permissions—nothing suspicious there unless it's part of privilege escalation.\n\nSome events involve deleting files in temporary directories and using sc.exe to delete services. Deleting temp files is common but could be part of a malicious routine to remove evidence.\n\nI also notice that many of these events are process creations and registry changes, which are typical during system operations, especially when scripts or commands run. However, the repeated deletions of user accounts across different names and domains might raise an eyebrow. It's unusual for legitimate processes to delete multiple users unless it's part of a larger cleanup or attack.\n\nAnother point is that some command lines use parameters like \"\/del \/domain\", which suggests they're deleting domain user accounts. This could be an attempt to remove access points from a network, possibly after compromising them.\n\nWhile there are red flags, such as the repeated deletions and commands to delete services, it's hard to say without context. These actions might be part of a legitimate script or admin task, but they could also signal something malicious like a post-exploitation cleanup.\n\nI should check if these events are happening in sequence, which they seem to be. The use of multiple command-line tools and the specific targeting of user accounts across domains is concerning. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or disable accounts as part of lateral movement.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive, the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and targeted deletions suggests potential malicious activity. This batch deserves closer scrutiny, possibly correlating with other logs and checking for known attack signatures.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe analysis of the system logs indicates a possible security incident that requires investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Process Activities**: Multiple instances of process creations (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) with specific command-line arguments suggest script execution or automated tasks.\n\n2. **User Account Management**: Several events show deletions of user accounts using commands like `net user \/del`. The use of `\/domain` indicates domain-wide deletions, which is unusual and could indicate an attempt to remove access points.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Changes to the registry during process creations might be part of legitimate operations but could also signal malicious activity, such as installing or removing software components.\n\n4. **Service Deletions**: Use of `sc.exe delete` commands suggests services are being removed. This could be an attempt to eliminate traces of malware or disable monitoring tools.\n\n5. **File Deletions in Temp Directory**: Commands deleting files in the temp directory might be part of cleaning evidence left by malicious activities.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of user deletions, service removals, and file deletions, along with the use of multiple command-line tools, suggests potential malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to determine if this indicates a breach or attack."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all seem similar. Each line represents an event with process information, winlog task, and file details. The command lines are either 'powershell.exe & {}' or variations of that. Some entries mention tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle', which I think is normal for PowerShell starting up.\n\nThen there's a line where powershell.exe sets a registry value. That might be a bit suspicious because writing to the registry can be a common tactic in malware, but it could also be legitimate software doing configuration. The event mentions rule 'RegistryEvent', so maybe that's flagged for monitoring.\n\nNext, I see multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, which PowerShell uses, so they're probably normal. But seeing multiple such entries might indicate some activity worth looking into.\n\nThere's a FileDeleteDetected event where a specific PS1 file is deleted. That catches my attention because deleting scripts could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities. The path seems temporary, so maybe it's related to testing script policies, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is normal or suspicious.\n\nOther events include process creations for whoami.exe and calc.exe. Whoami is often used by scripts to check permissions, and calc is a common benign tool, so these might not be red flags on their own unless they're being executed in an unusual way.\n\nThere are also process access events, which could indicate some form of inter-process communication, maybe legitimate or potentially malicious if part of a larger campaign.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: there's a lot of PowerShell activity. Even though it's commonly used for system administration, the combination of registry writes and file deletions might be concerning. The repeated use of powershell.exe and associated events could suggest script execution or lateral movement within a network, which are red flags in security.\n\nMoreover, seeing multiple instances where processes are created for whoami.exe and calc.exe alongside PowerShell activity might indicate an attacker using legitimate tools to mask malicious activities. This is known as living off the land, making detection harder because these tools are part of standard system utilities.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entries creating files could be related to log shipping or monitoring, which isn't inherently suspicious unless it's being used for exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together: while some individual events might seem benign, the volume and combination of activities—especially the PowerShell command-line arguments, registry modifications, file deletions, and the use of other utilities—could indicate malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting enough to warrant a closer look during an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Review:** The logs show multiple events involving powershell.exe with various tasks such as registry writes and image loads.\n\n2. **Registry Activity:** Powershell.exe modifying the registry could be suspicious, especially if it's setting keys that aren't standard for typical operations.\n\n3. **File Deletion Event:** A FileDeleteDetected event for a temporary script file might indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Process Creations:** Frequent creation of whoami.exe and calc.exe processes alongside powershell.exe could be signs of lateral movement or legitimate scripting, but warrant closer monitoring.\n\n5. **Combination of Activities:** The overall pattern suggests potential malicious behavior, as it combines several activities that could be part of an attack chain.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Given the nature and combination of these events, this batch is deemed interesting for further investigation to determine if a security incident has occurred.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch is considered interesting for investigation due to the suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, registry modifications, file deletions, and the use of other utilities like whoami.exe and calc.exe. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command-line arguments, registry writes, file deletion events, and usage of utilities like whoami.exe and calc.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two entries where the process is powershell.exe and the task is ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any access could be suspicious. However, without more context like specific file interactions or unusual command lines, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nNext, there's an event from ApplicationFrameHost.exe with a registry value set. This process is typically related to the Windows shell experience, like handling jump lists. Registry changes alone aren't alarming unless they're modifying sensitive areas or are part of a pattern.\n\nThen, there are three events from chrome.exe indicating network connections. While Chrome does make many connections as part of normal browsing, multiple such events in a short period might suggest something suspicious, especially if they're to unusual domains or if the connection attempts fail.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together: powershell.exe is flagged twice, which could be concerning. The ApplicationFrameHost event adds some noise but isn't necessarily malicious. The repeated network connections from Chrome stand out more, as they could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or communication with a command and control server.\n\nI'm considering whether these events collectively indicate potential malicious activity. While each individually might not raise flags, together they form a pattern that's worth investigating. The confidence isn't super high because the powershell.exe events are generic, but the repeated Chrome connections are a red flag.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple network connection events from chrome.exe and process access events from powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
