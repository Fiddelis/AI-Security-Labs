{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the creation of a file named \"objeto_temporario.txt\" by powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and creating temporary files could be part of that.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's normal if Chrome is updating or configuring settings, but I should keep an eye on the frequency and context.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run without any arguments. While legitimate uses exist, it's commonly used in scripts to check user permissions, so it might be a red flag depending on other events.\n\nLooking further, there are several powershell.exe processes accessing files and registry entries. The command lines show execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts with parameters pointing to temporary log paths. This script name suggests keylogging, which is definitely malicious activity. The repeated use of these scripts across different file paths indicates a potential persistence mechanism or multiple attempts.\n\nThere are also events related to image loading and provider lifecycle tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but combined with the other suspicious activities, they could indicate some form of payload execution or lateral movement within the system.\n\nThe deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1) is another red flag. Malware often cleans up its traces to avoid detection, so this could be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of powershell.exe with specific command-line arguments targeting keylogging and persistence, along with file creation and deletion activities, suggests a potential malicious campaign. The multiple instances of similar commands reinforce the suspicion that these events are part of a coordinated attack or exploit.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with parameters indicating keylogging activity, along with file creation and deletion actions, suggest potential malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe executing a script from C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script is supposed to log keystrokes into key.log in the TEMP directory. Powershell running scripts, especially ones with names like Get-Keystrokes, immediately raises a red flag because such scripts are often used for malicious activities like keylogging.\n\nThe second event indicates that there's an execute a remote command task, and the file involved is Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in a different path. This suggests that maybe another instance or another location where this script was executed. The fact that it's being run as a remote command could mean it's part of some larger malicious activity, possibly over multiple systems.\n\nThe third event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management and shouldn't be suspicious on its own. It creates a .yml.new file, which seems like a configuration backup or update. Not too concerning unless there's something unusual about the path or the content of that file.\n\nThe fourth event again has powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_temporario.txt in the user's downloads. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting, but the fact that it's creating a temporary file could be part of a malicious script's process to store data temporarily before exfiltration or further actions.\n\nThe fifth event involves svchost.exe creating a file in a Windows system directory. Svchost is a common host process for services, so by itself it's not suspicious. However, the path mentioned (keyValueLKG.dat) seems like an unusual filename and location. It could be part of legitimate Windows operations, but sometimes malware uses svchost.exe as a wrapper, so this might warrant closer look.\n\nLooking at all these together: there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is involved in executing scripts, especially the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which suggests keylogging behavior. The remote command execution adds another layer of concern, possibly indicating communication with an external server or distribution across machines. The other events, while not directly malicious, involve processes (powershell and svchost) often associated with both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it seems like there's a pattern of potentially malicious behavior involving powershell scripts that could be part of an attack chain. Therefore, the batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve PowerShell executing suspicious scripts and creating files, including potential keylogging activity (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), which indicates possible malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
