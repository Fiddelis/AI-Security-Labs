Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe being used with command lines that create scheduled tasks. These tasks are set to execute calc.exe at logon, which is unusual because calc.exe is typically benign, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with the same intent might be suspicious. The use of BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also a file created and then deleted in Temp by powershell.exe. This is a red flag because it suggests that some malicious script was being executed temporarily, possibly to bypass certain security policies or log tracking.\n\nThen there are multiple events where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". These could be indicators of remote execution or command injection attempts, which are common in attacks.\n\nAdditionally, other entries show powershell.exe loading various DLLs and chrome.exe making registry changes. While these aren't necessarily malicious on their own, combined with the scheduled tasks and file operations, they contribute to a concerning pattern.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of powershell.exe for creating multiple admin-level scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe, along with temporary file creation\/deletion, and remote command execution attempts, suggests potential malicious activity. This combination is more than just normal system behavior—it points towards possible persistence mechanisms or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges, along with temporary file creation and deletion, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm looking at a batch of 12 events here. Each event has three components: process details, winlog task, and file information.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the first event is from svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is known to be a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. But sometimes it's also used maliciously because many services run under it. However, on its own, this might not raise red flags.\n\nThe second event again involves svchost.exe creating a file in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\". The path looks a bit off—'unidade_comum' translates to 'common unit', which doesn't seem standard. Could be something trying to hide or create a persistence mechanism.\n\nMoving on, there are four events with the task \"Execute a Remote Command\" and no process or file info. These are tricky because without knowing the source or command details, it's hard to say. But remote commands can be malicious if they're executing arbitrary code, especially from unknown sources.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file in the user's AppData folder under \"Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\". PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and execution. The path here seems normal for legitimate PowerShell usage, like storing profile data, but it's worth noting because any unusual activity with PowerShell is a red flag.\n\nThen there are three events from chrome.exe loading images. Two of them load system files (amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll), which are legitimate. But the third one sets a registry value—this could be part of normal operation, like plugin installations or updates.\n\nThere are four more registry set tasks by chrome.exe, which might be related to extensions or configurations. However, excessive registry writes can sometimes indicate malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify system settings.\n\nLastly, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory with a .yml.new extension. Winlogbeat is an ELK stack component for log shipping, so this seems benign. Unless it's being misused, but no signs here.\n\nPutting it all together: The combination of svchost creating files, remote command executions without context, and powershell activity in the user profile could be concerning. These activities might indicate reconnaissance, persistence, or lateral movement. However, without more details on the commands or file contents, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. It's possible some of these are legitimate processes, but others raise suspicion.\n\nMy confidence is around 0.7 because there are red flags present, but not enough concrete evidence to be certain. The batch definitely warrants closer investigation to rule out potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe performing tasks that could indicate malicious activity such as registry modifications and file creations in unusual locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
