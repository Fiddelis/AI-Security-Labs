{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all process creations or registry changes, which could be signs of malicious activity. The first event is whoami.exe being executed. That's usually harmless, just showing user info, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's powershell.exe with a registry task. PowerShell can do a lot, both good and bad. A registry change might be normal admin work or could indicate tampering. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that it's paired with other events might raise a flag.\n\nLooking further down, I see multiple cmd.exe processes with command lines adding users and groups using net commands. Specifically, they're creating new users like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and adding them to Domain Admins. That's a red flag because creating multiple admin-level accounts can be part of privilege escalation or setting up backdoors.\n\nThe command lines show patterns: each user has a similar naming convention with underscores and numbers, which might indicate automation or script execution rather than manual actions by an admin. Also, the passwords are temporary and follow a pattern like \"elemento_ativo_pass123!\", suggesting they're generated by a script, not manually chosen.\n\nAdditionally, there's another powershell.exe event where a file was created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_base.txt. That could be part of the malicious activity—maybe storing configuration or other malicious data for later use.\n\nThe combination of multiple net and net1.exe commands creating users and groups, along with the registry changes and file creation in PowerShell, paints a picture of potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation. These actions are often steps attackers take after breaching a system to establish persistence and elevate privileges.\n\nI also notice that several processes were created from cmd.exe and powershell.exe, which can be common tools for attackers to execute commands and cover their tracks. The use of net1.exe is a bit unusual; it's an older command-line tool, so maybe the attacker is trying to avoid detection by using less common utilities.\n\nPutting all these together—the creation of multiple admin accounts with similar names and weak passwords, coupled with registry modifications and file operations—it seems like this batch could indicate malicious activity. The repetitive nature of the commands suggests a script or automated process, which makes it more concerning as it might be part of a larger attack campaign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including cmd.exe and net.exe are creating users and adding them to Domain Admins with suspicious patterns in usernames and passwords.
