So, I'm supposed to determine if a batch of system log events is interesting for investigation or not. The logs are given in JSONL format, with each line being a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event shows that cmd.exe was executed with some command-line arguments. The command creates a scheduled task named 'win32times' which runs daily. It executes powershell.exe with the argument -ep bypass and tries to execute a script from c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, NonExistingScript? That seems suspicious because it's not likely that such a script exists if it's part of malicious activity, like creating a backdoor or dropping malware.\n\n2. The second event is schtasks.exe being used to create another scheduled task with similar parameters but a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the script name seems fake, which might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. The third event shows schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is a normal part of how scheduled tasks work on Windows, so this in itself isn't suspicious.\n\n4. The fourth and fifth events involve svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files. SvcHost is commonly used by legitimate system services but can also be abused by malware. However, without more context, it's hard to say if these actions are malicious.\n\n5. Sixth event again uses schtasks.exe to query the 'win32times' task. Scheduled tasks being queried might be part of normal administrative activity or could indicate an attacker checking their persistence mechanisms.\n\n6. Seventh event is similar to the third one—schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll, which as I noted earlier, is standard.\n\n7. Eighth event has conhost.exe interacting with the registry. Conhost is typically related to console windows but can be used maliciously to hide processes or inject code. The exact action here (setting a registry value) could be part of persistence or privilege escalation.\n\n8. Ninth and tenth events involve winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipper, so these look like legitimate activities unless there's something unusual in the file paths or permissions.\n\n9. Eleventh event has powershell.exe creating a file named estrutura_geral.txt. Powershell is powerful but often used by attackers for script execution and lateral movement. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with previous events involving powershell, it might be worth looking into.\n\n10. Twelfth and thirteenth events again involve chrome.exe accessing the registry. Chrome sometimes writes to the registry when updating or changing settings, so unless there's an unusual pattern, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\n14. Fourteenth event is another powershell.exe creating a file: entrada_ativo.txt. Again, similar to earlier powershell events, could indicate script execution.\n\n15. Fifteenth event shows whoami.exe being run from the system32 directory without any arguments, which seems normal but can be used by attackers to check permissions or user context.\n\nPutting it all together, several red flags pop up:\n\n- Multiple use of schtasks.exe to create and query scheduled tasks with powershell commands. This is a common technique for creating persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to run at regular intervals regardless of reboots.\n- The script paths in the command lines are non-existent (NonExistingScript.ps1), which might be an attempt to avoid detection or use temporary scripts that get deleted after execution.\n- Powershell.exe being used multiple times to create files. While legitimate use cases exist, the combination with scheduled tasks and registry modifications could indicate malicious activity.\n- Conhost.exe interacting with the registry—could be part of hiding processes or enabling persistence.\n\nThe confidence level is high because several events point towards potential malicious activities, especially the repeated use of schtasks and powershell in ways that are common for attackers to establish persistence and lateral movement. The combination of these factors makes the batch of logs interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity, including creating scheduled tasks with potentially malicious PowerShell commands, repeated use of schtasks.exe, and file creations by powershell.exe which may indicate persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
