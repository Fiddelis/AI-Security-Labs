This technique is often used by attackers to:\n\n* **Hide recent modifications:**  By altering timestamps, they can make it appear as if files haven't been recently accessed or changed, masking malicious activity.\n* **Elude detection:** Security tools often rely on timestamps for detecting anomalies. Tampering with these times can help evade detection mechanisms.\n\nThe specific file paths involved might provide further clues about the attacker's intentions once analyzed in more detail. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other log entries you'd like me to analyze!"}
