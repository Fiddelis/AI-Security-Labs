{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario1\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a classification of the log events, focusing on potential malicious behavior:\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: Standard DNS queries are common for web browsing. Not inherently suspicious.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: PowerShell is a legitimate tool, process access logs are common. Needs further context.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION:  `whoami.exe` is a standard utility for displaying user information.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"cmd.exe\\\" \\\/c dir c:\\\\ \\\/b \\\/s .key | findstr \\\/e .key'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION:  This `cmd.exe` command searches for \".key\" files recursively within the C drive. While it could be harmless file searching, more context is needed.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe', 'command_line': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe  \\\/S \\\/D \\\/c\\\" dir c:\\\\ \\\/b \\\/s .key \\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to the previous entry, this `cmd.exe` command searches for \".key\" files recursively. The added `\/S` and `\/D` flags suggest a remote execution possibility. Requires further investigation.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION:  As with previous entries, PowerShell access is common and not inherently malicious.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'conhost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: Possibly}, JUSTIFICATION: While `conhost.exe` is legitimate, registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity. Needs further analysis of the registry changes.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'calc.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\urlmon.dll'}\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION:  `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` is standard behavior.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'Calculator.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: Possibly}, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to `conhost.exe`, registry changes by the calculator application could be unusual. Requires investigation of the registry modifications.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: As before, PowerShell access alone is not suspicious.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\amsi.exe'}\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: Chrome loading `amsi.exe` is expected as it's an antimalware service component.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: As before, PowerShell access alone is not suspicious. \n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * **CLASSIFICATION:** {INTERESTING: False}, JUSTIFICATION: As before, `whoami.exe` is a standard utility for displaying user information.\n\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Context is Key:**  Many of these events could be harmless without additional context about the user, system, and time of occurrence.\n* **Look for Patterns:** Malicious activity often involves multiple related events. Pay attention to sequences of unusual activity.\n* **Correlation is Crucial:** Combine log analysis with other security tools (e.g., network monitoring, antivirus) for a more complete picture.\n\n\nLet me know if you have more log entries or specific scenarios you'd like me to analyze!"}
