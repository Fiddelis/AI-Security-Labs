This alone doesn't raise suspicion.\n\n**{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry access (rule: RegistryAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n* **CLASSIFICATION:**  INTERESTING - Potentially interesting, requires further context.\n* **JUSTIFICATION:** Accessing the registry can be a legitimate action, but attackers often modify system settings through the registry.\n\n**{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File creation (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n* **CLASSIFICATION:**  INTERESTING - Potentially interesting, requires further context.\n* **JUSTIFICATION:** PowerShell can create files for various purposes, but malicious scripts often write to system locations or generate hidden files.\n\n**{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Network connection (rule: NetworkConnection)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n* **CLASSIFICATION:**  INTERESTING - Potentially interesting, requires further context.\n* **JUSTIFICATION:** PowerShell can initiate network connections for legitimate tasks, but attackers use it to exfiltrate data or communicate with command-and-control servers.\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Context is Key:** Logs are most meaningful when analyzed alongside other security information (user activity, system changes, network traffic).\n* **Rule Configuration:** The specific rules triggering alerts in your system will heavily influence what's classified as \"interesting.\" Adjust rules to match your environment's needs.\n* **Correlation:** Look for patterns and anomalies across multiple logs. A single event might be benign, but a sequence of unusual actions is more suspicious. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other log entries you'd like analyzed!"}
