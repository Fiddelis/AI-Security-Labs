{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario3\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a classification of the log events, focusing on potential malicious behavior:\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n    * {CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: PowerShell is often used for malicious activities like executing scripts or manipulating system settings.  Direct registry modifications are also common in malware.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"cmd.exe\\\" \\\/c attrib.exe +h %%temp%%\\\\estrutura_padrao.txt'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: The command `attrib.exe +h` hides a file in the temporary directory. This could be benign but often used by malware to avoid detection.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'attrib.exe', 'command_line': 'attrib.exe  +h C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\elemento_logico.txt'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to the previous entry, hiding a file in the AppData directory is suspicious and potentially indicative of malware activity.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'winlogbeat.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Winlogbeat is a legitimate security tool used for log collection and analysis. File creation during configuration setup is expected.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'svchost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: svchost.exe is a common Windows system process that often interacts with the registry for various legitimate tasks.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: ApplicationFrameHost.exe is related to the Windows shell and may modify registry settings as part of normal functionality.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Chrome is a common web browser and its settings are often stored in the registry. This is normal activity.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\pacote_base.txt'}\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION:  While PowerShell can be used for legitimate file creation, it's important to examine the contents of 'pacote_base.txt'. If it contains suspicious code or data, this warrants further investigation.}\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * {CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: whoami.exe is a standard Windows utility used to display the user's name. This activity is benign.}\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more log events you'd like me to analyze!"}
