This indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1` and `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`)  with elevated privileges. The creation of new files in user directories (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis`) by PowerShell further supports this suspicion.}** \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell:** Scheduled tasks are a common method for malware to run silently and repeatedly. \n* **`-ep bypass` Flag:** This PowerShell flag disables execution policy restrictions, allowing potentially harmful scripts to run even if they're not explicitly allowed.\n* **Non-Existing Scripts:** The log mentions scripts like `c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, suggesting the creation of these files might be part of a malicious process.\n\nLet me know if you have any more logs you'd like me to analyze!"}
