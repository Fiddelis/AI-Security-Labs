{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the log events and their classifications:\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  The creation and execution of multiple scheduled tasks using PowerShell, particularly with triggers set to \"AtLogon\" and targeting administrative privileges, is highly suspicious. This pattern suggests an attempt to establish persistent malicious activity on the system.**}\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  This further supports the previous classification as it reinforces the use of PowerShell for creating scheduled tasks with potential malicious intent.}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: Same reasoning as above. The repeated pattern of scheduled task creation using PowerShell raises a significant red flag.**}\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: Same reasoning as above.**}\n\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  Registry value changes are common system operations and not inherently malicious. Further context is needed to determine if this is unusual.**}\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: The creation of a new scheduled task with \"calc.exe\" as the target suggests potential malicious activity disguised as harmless behavior. It could be used for information gathering or command execution.**}\n\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  Standard Windows process loading DLLs is not unusual.  More context about \"amsi.dll\" usage would be needed to assess risk.**} \n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: Registry changes by a browser (chrome.exe) are typically benign and related to user preferences or settings.**}\n\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: A new file being created in the \"Downloads\" folder could indicate malicious activity, especially if its contents are unknown. Monitoring this file's content and behavior is recommended.**}\n\n \n\n\n **Additional Notes:**\n* **Context is Key:** While individual events might seem benign, patterns and correlations between them can reveal malicious intent. \n* **File Content Analysis:** Examining the contents of newly created files like \"objeto_auxiliar.txt\" is crucial for understanding the true nature of the activity. \n* **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Analyze network connections made by suspicious processes to identify potential communication with command-and-control servers or data exfiltration attempts.\n* **Security Tools:** Utilize antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and other security tools to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more log entries you'd like analyzed!"}
