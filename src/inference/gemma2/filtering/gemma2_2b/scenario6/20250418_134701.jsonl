These are TypeScript type definitions for the Lodash library.\n\n**What likely happened:**\n\nYou probably ran a command like `npm install lodash` or `yarn add lodash`. This would have downloaded the Lodash library and its TypeScript types into your project's `node_modules` folder. \n\n\nLet me know if you want more details about any specific file, or if you have any other questions about this log!"}
