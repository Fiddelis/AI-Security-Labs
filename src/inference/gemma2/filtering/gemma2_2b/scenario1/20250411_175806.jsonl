{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario1\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the log events, classified as \"Interesting\" or \"Not Interesting\" based on common cybersecurity threat indicators:\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'A high volume of PowerShell executions along with registry modifications are often indicative of malicious activity. Additionally, the execution of `reg` and `cmd` to add entries into the Run key suggests an attempt to achieve persistence.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Standard system process access. Common for legitimate applications to query their status or settings.'}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Standard system process access.  'whoami.exe' is commonly used to display the logged-in user.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'Repeated PowerShell executions raise suspicion, especially when combined with registry modifications.'}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'This process uses `cmd.exe` to add a scheduled task ('registro_auxiliar') which executes 'estrutura_principal.exe'. This behavior could indicate malware installation or execution of malicious scripts.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Standard system process access.'}**\n\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'The `cmd` command modifies the registry adding a scheduled task with suspicious naming ('entrada_principal'). This combined with the execution of 'pacote_temporario.exe' suggests potentially malicious activity.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Standard system process access.'}**\n\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'While not inherently malicious, repeated registry modifications by `cmd` and other processes warrant investigation. Could indicate a change to system settings or configuration manipulation.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Commonly used for process management and display.'}**\n\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'A new file created by `powershell.exe` in the Downloads folder raises suspicion.'}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'This appears to be a log configuration file for winlogbeat, a system monitoring tool.'}**\n\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'PowerShell execution coupled with registry modifications reinforces the possibility of malicious intent.'}**\n\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:  'Standard system process access.'}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: 'This appears to be a log configuration file for winlogbeat, a system monitoring tool.'}**\n\n\n\n\n **Important Notes:**\n*  Context is crucial! These classifications are based on isolated events. Examining the full set of logs and correlating them with other security data (network traffic, antivirus alerts) provides a more accurate picture.\n* Automated threat detection systems use complex algorithms and rules to analyze log data. This analysis provides a simplified overview.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other log events you'd like me to analyze!"}
