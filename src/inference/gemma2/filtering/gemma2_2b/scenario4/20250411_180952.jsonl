This is highly suspicious as it indicates potential privilege escalation attempts.}}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{`cmd.exe` is used to execute commands like  `net user ...` and `net group ...` which are typically used for administrative tasks, especially related to user and group management. In this case, the specific user and group names suggest potentially malicious intent.}}**\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{`powershell.exe` is used to create files (`pacote_base.txt`), access processes, and modify registry values. PowerShell's flexibility allows for both legitimate and malicious activities. The context of these actions alongside other events makes this interesting.}}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{`winlogbeat.exe` is creating a new configuration file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) which could indicate an attempt to monitor or collect system information. While winlogbeat itself can be used for legitimate security monitoring, its usage in this context requires further investigation.}}**\n\n* **The remaining events:**\n    *  **{CLASSIFICATION:{'NOT INTERESTING'}}:** These actions are common and don't raise immediate suspicion. For example:\n        * System processes like `svchost.exe` performing normal tasks (DNS queries, network connections).\n        * Web browsers (`chrome.exe`) accessing the internet.\n    \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."}
