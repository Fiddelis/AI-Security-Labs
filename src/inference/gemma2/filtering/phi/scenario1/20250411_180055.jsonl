{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario1\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the log events and their classifications, focusing on observable behavior rather than PowerShell usage alone:\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {The process creates a zip archive containing files from multiple directories. This level of activity suggests potential data exfiltration or archive creation for malicious purposes.}}** \n- Event: {\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"powershell.exe\\\" & {Compress-Archive -Path \\\\\\\"\\\"C:\\\\elemento_padrao\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\unidade_comum\\\\bin\\\\pacote_base\\\\\\\"\\\" -DestinationPath $env:TEMP\\\\elemento_temporario.zip -Force}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {Similar to the above event, this also compresses files into a ZIP archive and stores it in the TEMP directory. The use of environmental variables for file paths can obfuscate malicious activity.}}**\n- Event: {\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {Compress-Archive -Path \\\"C:\\\\modulo_temporario\\\\objeto_principal\\\\unidade_secundario\\\\bin\\\\entrada_logico\\\" -DestinationPath $env:TEMP\\\\elemento_logico.zip -Force}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {This event compresses files into a ZIP archive and stores it in the TEMP directory, suggesting potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.}}**\n- Event: {\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {Compress-Archive -Path \\\"C:\\\\tarefa_secundario\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\pacote_logico\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\" -DestinationPath $env:TEMP\\\\pacote_temporario.zip -Force}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Engine Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {Common system processes like notepad, calculator, and chrome accessing registry values is not inherently suspicious.}}**\n-  Events with  \"notepad.exe\", \"Calculator.exe\", \"chrome.exe\"\n\n **{CLASSIFICATION: {'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {Process creation of common utilities and browsers doesn't automatically indicate malicious intent. }}**\n\n\n- Events with  \"whoami.exe\"\n\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: {'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION: {File creation by winlogbeat is expected. However, its configuration file was newly created in a specific location (`Downloads`) which could warrant further investigation to ensure it's legitimate and configured properly.}}**\n\n- Event: {\"process\":\"{'name': 'winlogbeat.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\" }\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Focus on Actions:** We prioritize actions like file compression, archive creation, and registry modifications over the specific tool used (e.g., PowerShell). These actions can be benign or malicious depending on context.\n* **Suspicious Patterns:** Multiple instances of compressing files into ZIP archives and storing them in temporary directories raise flags. This behavior is often associated with data exfiltration attempts.\n* **Environment Variables:** Using environment variables for file paths adds a layer of obfuscation that could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific events or have other log entries you want analyzed!"}
