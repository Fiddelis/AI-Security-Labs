This could indicate script execution or manipulation of system files.\\n\\\n- **Suspicious registry changes:** Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe` making registry value sets warrant further investigation. They might be attempting to modify system configurations for malicious purposes.\\n\\\n- **File activity by winlogbeat:** The creation of a new `.yml` file within the `winlogbeat` directory could indicate configuration changes or potential compromise of this security tool.\"\n}\n```"}
