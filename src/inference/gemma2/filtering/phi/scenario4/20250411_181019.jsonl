{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario4\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the log events and their classifications, focusing on potential indicators of malicious behavior:\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION:  This sequence suggests an attempt to create a new service ('win32times') that executes a potentially malicious PowerShell script from 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The use of 'sc' and the specific command line raise suspicion.}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to the previous entry, this indicates another attempt to create a service ('win32times') that executes a PowerShell script from 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'.  The 'sc' utility and the command line suggest an unusual configuration.}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Multiple registry value sets by services.exe are common system activities and not necessarily malicious.}** \n*Note: While frequent registry modifications can sometimes be a sign of malware, in this case, the context doesn't provide strong evidence.*\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Standard system processes like notepad.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe  performing registry operations are not inherently suspicious.}**\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: These events indicate typical Chrome browser behavior (pipe creation, registry access, image loading).}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: PowerShell accessing itself is common for legitimate tasks. More context is needed to determine if this is suspicious.}**\n\n\n\n **Key Considerations:**\n\n\n* **Context:**  A single log event rarely tells the whole story. Analyze events in sequence and consider the overall system behavior.\n* **Baseline:** Establish normal activity patterns for your systems. Deviations from the norm are more likely to be malicious. \n* **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures):** Learn common attack patterns. Matching observed events to known TTPs can strengthen your analysis.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need assistance analyzing additional log entries!"}
