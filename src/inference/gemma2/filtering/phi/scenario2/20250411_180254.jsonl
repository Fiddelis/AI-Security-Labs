{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario2\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a classification of the log events based on your criteria:\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n    * CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: PowerShell executions often raise suspicion due to their scripting capabilities and potential for malicious code execution. Registry changes coupled with PowerShell warrant further investigation.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"cmd.exe\\\" \\\/c systeminfo & reg query HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION:  The command line includes `reg query` which accesses system registry information. Coupled with `systeminfo`, this could indicate an attempt to gather sensitive data.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION:  Accessing a process itself isn't inherently malicious. This could be legitimate system activity.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'systeminfo.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25030.2-0\\\\MpOAV.dll'}\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION:  `systeminfo.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, and loading `MpOAV.dll` suggests interaction with the Windows Defender platform.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'powershell.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}** \n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION:  Similar to the previous entry, accessing a process doesn't necessarily indicate malicious intent.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'calc.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\urlmon.dll'}\"}** \n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` is standard behavior. `urlmon.dll` handles URL protocol operations.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'Calculator.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\urlmon.dll'}\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: Same as above. `Calculator.exe` also relies on `urlmon.dll`.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'svchost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'File created (rule: FileCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\winevt\\\\Logs\\\\Parameters.evtx'}\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: `svchost.exe` is a common host process for various Windows services, and creating an event log file (`Parameters.evtx`) is a standard function.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'reg.exe', 'command_line': 'reg  query HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: `reg.exe` querying the registry is a common system administration task. \n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'cmd.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION:  `cmd.exe` is a powerful shell, and registry changes through it are not always malicious. Context is needed to determine intent.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'conhost.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: `conhost.exe` is the Windows console host process. Registry changes are likely related to its configuration or user settings.\n\n* **{\"process\":\"{'name': 'services.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Logon'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}**\n    * CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING\n    * JUSTIFICATION: `services.exe` manages Windows services, and the \"Logon\" event is typical for its operation.\n\n \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more log events to analyze!"}
