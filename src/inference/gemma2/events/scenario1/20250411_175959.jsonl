There are also multiple registry changes by Chrome which could be benign but require further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"events\/scenario1\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show typical system activity, including process creation, file access, and registry modifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior or unusual patterns.\"\n}\n``` \n\n\nLet me explain why this batch is classified as \"NOT INTERESTING\":\n\n* **Common System Processes:** Many events involve standard Windows processes like `net.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These are commonly used for system administration, scripting, and background tasks.\n* **Legitimate File Operations:** Events show file creation and access related to user profiles, temporary files, and configuration settings.  \n* **Standard Registry Modifications:** Some events indicate registry value changes associated with system processes and applications. This is typical for normal operation and configuration updates. \n\n**Important Note:** While this batch appears benign, it's crucial to remember that context matters. A deeper analysis might be necessary if:\n\n* There were unexpected or repetitive occurrences of specific events.\n* Events involved unusual file paths or registry keys.\n* The activity coincided with other suspicious behaviors on the system."}
