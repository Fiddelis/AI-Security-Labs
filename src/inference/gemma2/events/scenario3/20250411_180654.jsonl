{"file":"events\/scenario3\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"This log appears to be from a Windows system monitoring software, likely WinLogBeat, which collects and analyzes system events. It shows a variety of activities happening on the machine, including:\n\n**Suspicious Activities:**\n\n* **`powershell.exe & {&\\\"C:\\\\...\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\\\" -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log}`**: This indicates multiple instances of PowerShell scripts being executed with a name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`. The script likely aims to log keystrokes, which is a highly suspicious activity and could be indicative of malware or spyware.\n* **`File created (rule: FileCreate)`**: Multiple files are being created in various locations, including temporary directories (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp`). This file creation pattern can be used by malware to store data, configuration, or even execute malicious code.\n\n**Normal Activities:**\n\n* **`Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)`**: These entries show common Windows processes loading libraries and modules. \n* **`Engine Lifecycle`**:  This indicates the lifecycle events of the PowerShell engine, which is normal for a system using PowerShell.\n* **`Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)`**: Processes modifying registry values, which can be part of normal system operation or malicious activities depending on the changes made.\n\n**Additional Points:**\n\n* The presence of `winlogbeat.exe` suggests that this log is being generated by the WinLogBeat monitoring tool.\n* The filenames like `pacote_temporario.txt`, `entrada_padrao.txt` might indicate legitimate file transfers or configurations, but further investigation is needed to confirm their purpose.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Immediately isolate the affected machine.** This prevents further potential damage from malware and allows for a more secure analysis.\n2. **Analyze the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` scripts in detail**. Look for malicious code, network connections, or any attempts to steal sensitive information.\n3. **Review the recently created files** listed in the log. Pay attention to unusual file names, locations, or content.\n4. **Run a full system scan with reputable antivirus and antimalware software.** This can help identify and remove any existing threats.\n5. **Consider changing passwords for sensitive accounts** on the affected machine.\n\n\nIt's crucial to treat these logs seriously as they indicate potentially malicious activity. Conduct a thorough investigation and take appropriate security measures to protect your system."}
