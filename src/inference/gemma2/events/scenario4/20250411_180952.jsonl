{"file":"events\/scenario4\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a classification of the log events, focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{Several processes are performing actions that could be benign but are also commonly used by malware for lateral movement and privilege escalation.  \n* **cmd.exe** and **net.exe** are being used to create user accounts (\"pacote_principal_Admin\", \"unidade_comum_Admin\") and add them to the \"Domain Admins\" group. This level of administrative access can be dangerous if not authorized.\n\n *  **powershell.exe** is frequently used for various tasks, including process access, registry modifications, and file creation. While PowerShell itself isn't malicious, its flexibility makes it a favorite tool for attackers. \n* **winlogbeat.exe** creating files in user download directory raises suspicion. This could be legitimate but requires further investigation to determine if the configuration is standard or altered.\n\nThese events warrant closer examination and correlation with other data points to confirm if they represent a genuine threat.}}\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to analyze any specific events in more detail!"}
