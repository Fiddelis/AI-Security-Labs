{"file":"events\/scenario2\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a classification of the log events based on the provided information. Remember, without deeper context and network analysis, identifying definitively malicious activity can be challenging.\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{The  `cmd.exe` command attempts to schedule a task (`schtasks`) that runs `powershell.exe` with the `-ep bypass` flag. This is a classic technique used by attackers to evade security restrictions. Additionally, the scheduled task has a non-existent script file path ('c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1').  This suggests potential malicious intent.}}** \n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{`schtasks` is being used to schedule another task (`win32times`) that executes `powershell.exe` with the `-ep bypass` flag and a script from 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Again, the use of `-ep bypass` combined with non-existent scripts raises suspicion.}}**\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{Multiple `svchost.exe` processes are setting registry values. While not inherently malicious, frequent and unusual registry modifications by `svchost.exe` can be a sign of malware installation or activity. }}**\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{This event log entry is related to the  creation of a scheduled task (`win32times`) using `schtasks`. While the command line shows that it will execute `powershell.exe`, it doesn't immediately indicate malicious intent.}} **\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{Standard system process behavior. `conhost.exe` (Windows Console Host) is a common process responsible for running console applications and setting registry values. This could be related to legitimate tasks or configuration changes.}}** \n\n\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{Commonly used for logging and security analysis. The  creation of the `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file suggests that Winlogbeat, a log shipper tool, is being configured.}} **\n\n**{CLASSIFICATION:{'NOT INTERESTING'}, JUSTIFICATION:{ This event log entry indicates normal system activity. `chrome.exe` making registry changes could be related to browser settings or extensions. }}**\n\n\n Let me know if you have more context or specific questions about certain events!"}
