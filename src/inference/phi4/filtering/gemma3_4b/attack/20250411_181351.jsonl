This could indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms.\n   - Similarly, the loading of `MpOAV.dll` (part of Microsoft Defender Antivirus) suggests potential interference with antivirus functions.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: The combination of these activities from a single process (`chrome.exe`) raises red flags for potential malicious behavior.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the significant indicators present but acknowledges that further investigation would be necessary to confirm any malicious intent definitively."}
