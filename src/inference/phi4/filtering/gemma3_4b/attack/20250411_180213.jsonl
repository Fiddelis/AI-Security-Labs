Frequent registry value modifications by chrome.exe could indicate a persistence mechanism or an attempt to modify system settings stealthily. The use of sc.exe to start wuauserv (Windows Update service) might be attempting to ensure updates are not interrupted, possibly to maintain persistence or delay detection. Image load events involving amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe could suggest attempts at bypassing antivirus defenses, as these are commonly used by security software for anti-malware scanning. Finally, the execution of whoami.exe could be an attempt to gather system information, which is common in reconnaissance activities by attackers.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
