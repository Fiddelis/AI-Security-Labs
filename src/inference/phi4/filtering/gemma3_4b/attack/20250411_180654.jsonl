The 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' script is repeatedly used across different command lines and paths, indicating potential keylogging activity. Additionally, there are rapid creation and deletion of files in the Temp directory, which often indicates attempts to hide tracks or manage temporary payloads. Registry events involving both PowerShell and conhost.exe also suggest manipulation of system settings, possibly for persistence or evasion.\"\n}\n```"}
