While `chrome.exe` can legitimately modify certain registry keys, such as for configuration purposes (e.g., extensions or settings), the high frequency and lack of additional context in these logs suggest potential malicious intent like persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system changes. This pattern warrants further investigation to rule out any security incidents. The confidence level is set at 0.75 due to the typical benign nature of `chrome.exe` combined with the unusual frequency of registry events, which are not conclusive on their own but are suspicious enough to be investigated further."}
