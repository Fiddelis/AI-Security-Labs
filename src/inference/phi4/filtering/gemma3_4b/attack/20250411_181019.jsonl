This combined with powershell accessing processes and loading significant DLLs like `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` suggests an attempt to evade detection or alter system behavior, both characteristic of advanced persistent threats (APTs) or malware trying to maintain persistence or change settings stealthily. Thus, this warrants further investigation. The confidence is slightly less than 1 due to the need for additional context to confirm malicious intent definitively."}
