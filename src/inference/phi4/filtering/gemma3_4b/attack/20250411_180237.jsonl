These actions are often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) or privilege escalation attempts, especially when combined with other processes such as `cmd.exe`, which was used to execute system commands. The presence of repeated file creations by `winlogbeat.exe` in the same location is unusual and could suggest manipulation of log files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
