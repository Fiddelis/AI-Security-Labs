The presence of command-line executions with `cmd.exe` to create new processes like `notepad.exe`, combined with the use of tools like `WMIC.exe` loading system files, suggests potential exploitation attempts. Furthermore, various processes setting registry values and file creation events, especially with a tool known for log forwarding (`winlogbeat.exe`), could indicate attempts at persistence or data exfiltration.\"\n}\n```"}
