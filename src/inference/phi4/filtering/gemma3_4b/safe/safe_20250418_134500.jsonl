Such behavior could be indicative of a compromised browser or malicious extension activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"The log data provided appears to be from a system's event log, detailing various activities and actions performed by different processes on the computer. Here's an analysis of key events:\n\n1. **Registry Event**: \n   - The `RuntimeBroker.exe` process sets a registry value (`task: \"RegistryEvent\"`). This typically involves configuration or permission adjustments for apps in Windows environments.\n\n2. **File Creation**:\n   - Multiple entries show file creation, specifically related to the `WindowsUpdate` logs and `winlogbeat` log files. For example, Windows creates files like `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.X.etl` which are event trace log (ETL) files used for troubleshooting updates.\n   - Winlogbeat creates a file (`logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`) to store logs in the newline-delimited JSON format, useful for sending logs to Elasticsearch or other systems.\n\n3. **Process Creation**:\n   - Several processes are noted as being created:\n     - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is likely updating Microsoft Edge.\n     - `winlogbeat.exe` starts, indicating that Winlogbeat is running on the system to collect and ship log data.\n\n4. **Process Access & Termination**:\n   - The logs show access to processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` accessed by another process) and their termination events.\n   - Network connections are also detected for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, suggesting communication with external servers, likely for downloading updates.\n\n5. **Image Loading**:\n   - The `ImageLoad` events indicate that certain files or executables (like those belonging to Microsoft Edge Update and Winlogbeat) are being loaded into memory. This is typically part of the process initialization phase.\n\n6. **Network Activity**:\n   - Network connections detected for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which likely involve fetching updates from Microsoft's servers.\n\nThese logs indicate routine system operations involving software updates (for Microsoft Edge), log collection and forwarding activities by Winlogbeat, and general system monitoring through registry changes and process management. This type of logging is crucial for maintaining security and operational integrity on a system by providing insights into potential issues or unauthorized activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"The log entries you've shared appear to be system event logs related to various processes and file activities on a Windows machine. Here's an analysis of the events:\n\n1. **File Operations:**\n   - A series of `File created`, `File deleted`, and `File creation time changed` events are logged, indicating that files are being managed as part of regular operations or updates.\n   - The logs show file activities related to software updates, particularly for Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and other system processes like `svchost.exe`.\n\n2. **Process Activities:**\n   - Several process creation events are noted, such as those involving `notepad.exe`, `Explorer.EXE`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe`. These indicate the launching of applications or services.\n   - The log entries also include a specific update operation for Microsoft Edge, where an installer is created (`setup.exe`) and subsequently executed.\n\n3. **Registry and DNS Activities:**\n   - A registry value set event by `Explorer.EXE` suggests configuration changes possibly due to software installations or system settings modifications.\n   - A DNS query event logged by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which could relate to checking connectivity or updating service configurations.\n\n4. **Update and Cleanup Operations:**\n   - The logs show the update process of Microsoft Edge from version 135.0.3179.66 to 135.0.3179.73.\n   - Temporary files associated with updates are created and then deleted, indicating a cleanup step post-update.\n\n5. **Windows Update Logs:**\n   - A Windows Update log file creation (`WindowsUpdate.etl`) suggests that Windows has been checking for or applying system updates around the specified date (20250418).\n\n6. **Winlogbeat Operations:**\n   - The `winlogbeat.exe` process is involved in creating a configuration file (`._winlogbeat.yml.new`), possibly related to monitoring or log collection activities.\n\nOverall, these logs depict routine maintenance and update tasks on a Windows machine. If you have specific concerns or need further analysis of certain events, please let me know!"}
