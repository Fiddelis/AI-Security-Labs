These modifications can be a red flag, especially if they change how applications are accessed or executed.\n\n2. **Frequent Network Activity**:\n   - There are multiple instances of network connections detected by `Discord.exe`, which could suggest data exfiltration or communication with external servers for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **DNS Queries**:\n   - The presence of DNS queries further supports the possibility of establishing communications with potentially harmful domains, indicating an attempt to bypass security controls.\n\n4. **Repeated Pipe Creation Events**:\n   - Multiple pipe creation events may signify attempts at inter-process communication that could be used for command and control operations or data transfer within a malicious context.\n\n5. **Executable File Activities**:\n   - The detection of `Discord.exe` executing additional files like `ffmpeg.dll` and `Google.Widevine.CDM.dll`, particularly from the temporary directory, is unusual and warrants investigation as it could be indicative of an attempt to load unauthorized or harmful code.\n\n6. **Process Access and Image Load Events**:\n   - Frequent process access and image load events involving system-critical files indicate that `Discord.exe` might be leveraging its permissions in ways not typical for legitimate software use.\n\nThese points collectively suggest a pattern consistent with attempts at subverting normal application behavior, potentially to execute malicious activities. The combination of these factors justifies the classification as \"INTERESTING\" for further investigation."}
