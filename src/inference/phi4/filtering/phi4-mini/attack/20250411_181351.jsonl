Additionally, a PowerShell script file was created and deleted quickly, suggesting malicious intent to execute or hide its activities. The presence of registry modifications by various processes like `conhost.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` could be indicative of persistence mechanisms being established. Moreover, the execution of a remote command logged without an associated process suggests potential lateral movement within the network.\"\n}\n```"}
