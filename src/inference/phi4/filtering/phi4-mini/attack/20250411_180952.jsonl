Additionally, registry modifications by powershell.exe and conhost.exe suggest attempts to persist malicious configurations or bypass security mechanisms. The repeated file creations, especially for winlogbeat configuration files and .yml.new files, alongside PowerShell and svchost activities, raise concerns about potential data exfiltration or manipulation of monitoring tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
