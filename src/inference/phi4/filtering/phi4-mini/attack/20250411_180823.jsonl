{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities were observed, including numerous registry value modifications by chrome.exe and the loading of system files like amsi.dll by an unrelated process. Additionally, Powershell was used to create and access files, combined with the execution of whoami.exe from the command line.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Registry Modifications**: The frequent setting of registry values by `chrome.exe` is unusual, as browsers typically do not make multiple changes to the system registry for legitimate purposes.\n\n2. **Image Loading**: The loading of `amsi.dll` (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and other Defender-related files (`MpOAV.dll`) in the context of `chrome.exe` is suspicious. Malicious actors often disable or evade antivirus software by interacting with these components.\n\n3. **Powershell Activity**: Powershell's role in creating a file (`unidade_ativo.txt`) and accessing processes indicates potential command execution, which can be used for various malicious activities such as downloading and executing malware.\n\n4. **Command Line Execution of whoami.exe**: The process `whoami.exe` is executed via the command line by an external script or tool (likely from Powershell). This could indicate attempts to gather user information for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe combination of these activities across different processes suggests potential malicious behavior, meriting further investigation."}
