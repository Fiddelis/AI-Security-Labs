{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of a single process ('chrome.exe') setting registry values, which could indicate suspicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware. Additionally, 'powershell.exe' is creating files and there are image loads from legitimate system paths, which may be benign but should be investigated for unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Repetitive Registry Changes**: The frequent setting of registry values by `chrome.exe` could suggest malicious activities such as persistence or configuration changes designed to evade detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: The creation of files using `powershell.exe` can be benign but is often used in attack scripts for executing commands, downloading payloads, and other potentially harmful operations.\n\n3. **Image Loads**: Although the image loads pertain to legitimate system paths (`amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`), these could be part of an attempt to disable security features like AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) or Windows Defender, depending on context and timing.\n\nOverall, while some activities might appear benign individually, in combination they warrant further investigation due to the potential for coordinated malicious behavior. The confidence level reflects the likelihood that this pattern is indicative of suspicious activity, though not conclusively proof without additional contextual information."}
