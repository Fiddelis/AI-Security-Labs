{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving high-privilege processes like svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Notably, there are numerous 'Registry value set' events from both trusted (svchost.exe) and potentially malicious processes (powershell.exe, chrome.exe). The frequent registry modifications by these processes can indicate a persistence mechanism or an attempt to modify system behavior for malicious purposes. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe to create files in user directories, including 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', may suggest attempts to establish persistence or execute scripts upon startup. These activities together form a pattern that warrants further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
