The presence of repeated process accesses by `Update.exe` further heightens suspicion, as it could indicate an automated or script-driven sequence that might be used to establish persistence or execute unwanted tasks. These observations are consistent with behaviors often seen in malicious activities such as malware installation or persistence mechanisms. However, the confidence level is not absolute due to the lack of direct indicators of malicious payloads; further investigation would be warranted."}
