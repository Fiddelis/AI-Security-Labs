It loads combase.dll and urlmon.dll, which could suggest an attempt to inject or execute unauthorized code within these libraries, indicative of potential malware activity.\n\nThe combination of unusual processes performing actions typically associated with malicious behavior warrants further investigation. The confidence level reflects the presence of multiple indicators of compromise but acknowledges that without additional context, absolute certainty is not possible."}
