Additionally, there are numerous pipe creation events involving `bash.exe` and other Unix-like utilities running in a Windows environment (e.g., `mintty.exe`, `cygwin-console-helper.exe`). This could suggest an attempt to use these tools for lateral movement or covert communication. Furthermore, the event involving `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` is unusual since this DLL is related to anti-malware instrumentation, potentially indicating attempts at bypassing security mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
