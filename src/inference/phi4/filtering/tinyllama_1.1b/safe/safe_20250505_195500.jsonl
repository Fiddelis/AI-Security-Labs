These files appear to be localized language resources for offline use within Office applications, as indicated by their naming convention (e.g., 'fi-fi-ui-strings-json'). The duplication of some file creations suggests that this might be a normal behavior during an update or installation process where files are initially written and then overwritten, or it could indicate inefficiencies in the system's handling of updates. Given SDXHelper is not typically associated with malicious activity, but unusual behavior such as repeated writes should be monitored for potential issues like inefficient resource usage or configuration errors.
