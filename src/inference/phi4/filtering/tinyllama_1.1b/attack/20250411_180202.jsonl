The use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with WMIC to create processes, alongside the loading of DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) that are associated with Windows components but could potentially be tampered with or used in exploits, raises suspicion. Additionally, a file creation event for `objeto_temporario.txt` via PowerShell adds to the potential concern as it might indicate data exfiltration or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
