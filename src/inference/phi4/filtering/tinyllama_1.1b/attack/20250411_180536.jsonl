There are several processes accessed by powershell.exe, which could indicate attempts to execute scripts or commands that modify the system state without user consent. Additionally, there are repeated instances of registry value changes by cmd.exe and svchost.exe, which may suggest attempts at persistence or system configuration alterations. The presence of custom executables like 'pacote_padrao.exe' loading critical system DLLs is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
