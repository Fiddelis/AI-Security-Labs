This can be normal behavior but when done repeatedly in quick succession without user action, it could indicate malicious activity or an exploit.\n\n- **Image Load for Defender DLL:** A file associated with Windows Defender (`MpOAV.dll`) being loaded by `chrome.exe` is unusual since `chrome.exe` should not typically interact with system defense components directly. This may suggest a bypass attempt or tampering.\n\n- **Powershell Access Event:** While PowerShell accessing processes can be benign, it adds to the suspicious nature of this batch when combined with other anomalies like repeated registry changes and unexpected image loading.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation."}
