{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry value sets and image load events for chrome.exe, along with a potentially suspicious file creation by powershell.exe.\"\n}\n``` \n\nThis batch is interesting due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Registry Value Sets:** There are multiple events of registry value settings associated with `chrome.exe`. Frequent changes to the registry by an application like Chrome could indicate attempts to persist changes or execute additional commands.\n\n2. **Image Load Events:** One event involves loading `amsi.dll`, which is commonly used for anti-malware instrumentation bypass techniques. Another image load event concerns `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender, suggesting possible interference with security software.\n\n3. **File Creation by PowerShell:** A file was created using `powershell.exe`, which can be a legitimate action but also indicates potential scripting activity that could be used for malicious purposes if combined with other suspicious indicators."}
