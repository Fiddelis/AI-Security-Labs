These actions are indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs). The repeated provider lifecycle events suggest automated behavior possibly linked to script execution. Additionally, the presence of ImageLoad events for Windows Defender-related DLLs could indicate attempts at evasion or interference with security software.\"\n}\n```"}
