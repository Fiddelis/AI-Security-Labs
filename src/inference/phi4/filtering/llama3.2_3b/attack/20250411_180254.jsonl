PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be exploited for malicious purposes, particularly when combined with other indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as querying the HKLM\\\\SYSTEM registry path or accessing sensitive processes. The repeated use of chrome.exe to set registry values could indicate an attempt at persistence or configuration changes, which warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
