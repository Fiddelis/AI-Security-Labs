Additionally, multiple processes ('systeminfo.exe', 'svchost.exe', 'conhost.exe', etc.) are involved in setting or loading potentially sensitive files like 'amsi.dll'. The use of 'cmd.exe' to execute potentially malicious commands combined with the involvement of various system processes makes this batch worth investigating for potential security breaches.\"\n}\n```"}
