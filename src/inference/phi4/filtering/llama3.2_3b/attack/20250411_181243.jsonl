The command line executed by 'powershell.exe' retrieves sensitive information about users and groups ('net user', 'get-localuser', etc.), indicating potential reconnaissance activities. Additional events show the creation of files via PowerShell that may involve persistence mechanisms or script execution (e.g., StartupProfileData-NonInteractive). Furthermore, registry manipulations are detected, which could signify attempts to maintain access or alter system behavior. The presence of multiple security-related tasks being accessed, such as 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management', combined with the usage patterns of PowerShell in this context, warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
