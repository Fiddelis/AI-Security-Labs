The first event logs 'sppsvc.exe' loading 'taskschd.dll', which is suspicious as 'sppsvc.exe' should not be interacting with task scheduler DLLs; this could indicate privilege escalation attempts or masquerading of processes. Additionally, the Discord-related events show a process accessing system resources and changing file creation times in its cache storage directory, which may suggest data manipulation or persistence techniques typically associated with malware.\"\n}\n```"}
