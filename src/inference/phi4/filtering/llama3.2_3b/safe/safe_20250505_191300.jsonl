This pattern can be indicative of suspicious or malicious activity, especially if these actions are not typical behavior for the application.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\nThis classification is based on the potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) observed within the batch: frequent network connections by a single process (Discord.exe), which could be unusual or unauthorized, coupled with file operations that might signal attempts to manipulate files for persistence or data exfiltration. However, without additional context, such as whether these actions align with legitimate application behavior or known attack patterns, there remains some uncertainty, hence the confidence level is not maximal."}
