{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180602.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` accessing processes and creating files, along with `whoami.exe` being executed could indicate privilege escalation attempts or script-based attacks. The high frequency of `chrome.exe` modifying registry values suggests potential persistence mechanisms or other unauthorized modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Powershell Usage**: \n   - Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used legitimately but also for malicious purposes, such as executing scripts to manipulate system configurations.\n   - In the log, `powershell.exe` is creating files and accessing processes, which could indicate unauthorized or suspicious activities.\n\n2. **Whoami Execution**:\n   - The execution of `whoami.exe` typically checks for user privileges or identity. Its presence might suggest that an actor is verifying their access level, possibly before attempting privilege escalation.\n\n3. **Chrome Registry Modifications**:\n   - Repeated registry changes by `chrome.exe` could indicate attempts to alter system settings or establish persistence. It is unusual for a browser process to frequently modify the registry without user action.\n   \n4. **Overall Context**:\n   - The combination of these activities raises suspicion of potential security threats, such as script execution, privilege escalation attempts, and unauthorized configuration changes.\n\nGiven these observations, the batch warrants further investigation due to its alignment with common attack patterns in cybersecurity incidents. The confidence level reflects the presence of several indicators of compromise, although without more context (like user actions or network activity), it's not definitive proof of malicious intent."}
