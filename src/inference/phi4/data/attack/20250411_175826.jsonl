Additionally, there are file creation events related to winlogbeat and PowerShell on user directories that might indicate attempts at persistence or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\nThis classification identifies suspicious behavior based on repeated registry changes by an application (chrome.exe) not typically responsible for such actions, combined with file activities involving monitoring tools and PowerShell scripts. These patterns could suggest potential malicious activity or misconfiguration that warrants further investigation. The confidence level reflects the significant likelihood of these activities being noteworthy in a cybersecurity context, though further analysis would be needed to confirm any threats conclusively."}
