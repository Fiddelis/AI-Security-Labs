Notably, there are multiple instances of 'Process Access' and 'Registry Value Set' rules triggered by powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and other executables. These actions could indicate privilege escalation attempts or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the command line for processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe indicates suspicious activities such as searching for .key files and manipulating registry settings, which are common indicators of malware.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
