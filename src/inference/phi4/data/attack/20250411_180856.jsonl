{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a combination of normal and potentially suspicious activities. While most events are benign (e.g., network connections from chrome.exe, process creation for notepad.exe), the series of 'Image loaded' events involving WMIC.exe loading critical system files like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, combined with 'Registry value set' events by various processes such as powershell.exe and cmd.exe, may suggest an attempt to modify or evade security mechanisms. This pattern is often associated with sophisticated malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving sensitive operations and potentially suspicious processes (e.g., whoami.exe, powershell.exe access) warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Process Accesses and Creations**: \n   - `powershell.exe` is accessed multiple times, which can indicate the use of PowerShell for executing scripts that may be malicious.\n   - `whoami.exe` is created, often used by attackers to check their privileges on a system.\n\n2. **Registry Events**:\n   - A registry value set event involving `svchost.exe`, which is commonly used by both legitimate and malicious software due to its trusted status in Windows environments.\n\n3. **Logon Events**:\n   - Regular logon and special logon events may indicate unusual or unauthorized access attempts, especially if these correlate with the suspicious process activities noted above.\n\nOverall, these combined activities suggest potential malicious behavior that merits a closer investigation. The presence of common attack vectors like PowerShell scripting and whoami usage increases the likelihood of compromise or reconnaissance activity within this batch."}
