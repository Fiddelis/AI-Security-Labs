While this can be normal, the high frequency may indicate suspicious activity such as data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Process Access Events**: A large number of process access events for `Discord.exe` could suggest an attempt to manipulate or interfere with its operation. This behavior warrants further investigation for potential malware activity.\n\n3. **File Creation Time Changes**: The modification of file creation times in the Discord directory might indicate tampering with logs or files, which can be a sign of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.\n\n4. **Overall Pattern**: The combination of these events points towards unusual and potentially malicious behavior that merits closer scrutiny."}
