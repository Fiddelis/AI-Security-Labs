Here's a summary of what the logs indicate:\n\n1. **Microsoft Office (SDXHelper.exe) activities:**\n   - There were numerous file creation events involving JavaScript files (`.js` files) in the `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min` directory. These files are likely related to the Office Scripts feature introduced in Microsoft 365. Each event indicates that a new minified JavaScript file was created.\n\n   - The process `SDXHelper.exe`, which is associated with Microsoft Office, performed these file creation activities multiple times between February 24 and March 1.\n\n2. **Chrome (chrome.exe) activity:**\n   - There was one registry value set event (`RegistryEvent`) involving Chrome on February 28 at 07:39. This could indicate that Chrome was either installed, updated, or had its settings changed around this time.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `SDXHelper.exe` activities were occurring more frequently than usual, with some files being created multiple times within short intervals (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_4fbdfb16bbe241df35afce95197ba8aa.js`). This could potentially indicate an issue or misconfiguration related to Office Scripts. However, without more context or further investigation, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of these frequent file creation events.\n\nIf you're concerned about these activities, it might be helpful to reach out to Microsoft support or consult their official documentation to ensure that your Office Scripts are functioning as intended and not causing excessive resource usage. Additionally, monitoring Chrome for any unusual behavior related to the registry event could also be beneficial."}

The files created are primarily JavaScript files related to Office strings and tasks, indicating potential language pack updates or feature additions. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for these activities.\n\nIf you're concerned about these activities or believe they may be malicious, I recommend running a full system scan with up-to-date antivirus software to ensure no malware is present on your system. If the activities continue after a clean scan, they are likely legitimate Office processes."}
