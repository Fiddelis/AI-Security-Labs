Winlogbeat was also started and created a new log file, suggesting that it's functioning as intended. Lastly, PowerShell accessed the winlogbeat process, indicating some interaction between these two processes.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Check if Microsoft Edge Update service is properly configured and if there are any recent updates or pending updates.\n- Monitor Winlogbeat for any errors or issues.\n- Review PowerShell script logs to understand why it accessed the winlogbeat process."}
