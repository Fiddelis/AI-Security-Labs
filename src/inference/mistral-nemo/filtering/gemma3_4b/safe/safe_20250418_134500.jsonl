{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a summary of what happened:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**\n   - A MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process was created.\n   - It loaded several DLLs (msedgeupdate.dll and others) located in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\1.3.195.49`.\n   - The process accessed other processes but did not perform any notable actions or access files.\n   - The process made two network connections (possibly to check for updates).\n   - After a while, the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process was terminated three times consecutively.\n\n2. **Registry Access:**\n   - A RuntimeBroker.exe process set a registry value. This is likely related to Windows'Runtime Broker service, which manages toast notifications and background tasks.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Process:**\n   - After the Microsoft Edge update events, a winlogbeat.exe process was created.\n   - Winlogbeat is an Elastic agent that ships logs from Windows to Elasticsearch or Logstash. It was started from `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64`.\n   - The process loaded its executable and created a log file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`.\n\nThere are no apparent security threats or anomalies in the provided logs, as all events seem to be related to regular system operations like software updates and log management.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that:\n- Event logs were truncated, so there might be more context or details not shown here.\n- Always monitor your system for unusual activities and unexpected behaviors.\n- Consider configuring advanced monitoring tools for deeper insights into your system's security posture."}
