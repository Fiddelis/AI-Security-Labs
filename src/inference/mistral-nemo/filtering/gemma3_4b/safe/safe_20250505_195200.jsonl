The files created were JavaScript files (with the `.min.js` extension) related to Office AI, as indicated by their names (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_X.js`, where `X` is a hash).\n\n3. The creation of these files seems repetitive and continuous, as the logs span several events with different hashes.\n\nHere are a few examples of the created files:\n\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_a1f2c4d5e6789012.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_3456789abcdef123.js`\n- `officeaicopilot-strings.min_-fedcba9876543210.js`\n\nIf this behavior is unwanted or causing issues, you might want to investigate the `SDXHelper.exe` process and consider disabling it if it's not essential for your current tasks. However, be cautious when dealing with system processes, as incorrect modifications could lead to unexpected results.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Open Task Manager ( press Ctrl + Shift + Esc)\n- Find the `SDXHelper.exe` process\n- Right-click on it and select \"Open file location\" to check its origin and whether it's digitally signed by a trusted source.\n- Check if there are any related scheduled tasks or services that might be causing these repetitive file creations."}
