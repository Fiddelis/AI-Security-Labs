Review the context and timestamps of these events to determine if they are related.\n2. Check for any abnormal behavior or anomalies associated with the involved processes.\n3. Inspect the created files for unusual content or signs of malicious activity.\n4. Monitor user account management activities and special logon events more closely to ensure their legitimacy."}
