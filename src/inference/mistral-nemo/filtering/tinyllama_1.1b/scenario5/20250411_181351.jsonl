{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/scenario5\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows Event Log (Wevtx) data, here's a summary of notable activities and potential security concerns:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activities:**\n   - A PowerShell script created several temporary files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` and saved screenshots with names like `objeto_principal.png`, `elemento_base.png`, etc.\n   - The script also wrote to a `.ps1` file at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\Documents\\windows-powershell.exe.ps1`.\n   - A suspicious PowerShell startup profile was created at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat Installation:**\n   - Winlogbeat was installed and configured, with a new `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file created in the Downloads folder.\n   - This could indicate preparation for data exfiltration or monitoring.\n\n3. **Registry Activities:**\n   - Multiple registry values were set by `powershell.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, and `chrome.exe`. While some of these might be legitimate, a high number of registry modifications can indicate suspicious behavior.\n   - Some registry activities occurred shortly after PowerShell script executions, suggesting possible manipulation or reconnaissance.\n\n4. **Dns Query:**\n   - A DNS query was performed by `chrome.exe`, which could imply network communication for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) traffic.\n\n5. **Image Loaded:**\n   - `amsi.dll` was loaded by `chrome.exe`. While this is a legitimate Windows component, its loading might be related to the observed DNS query and PowerShell activities.\n\n6. **Pipe Created:**\n   - A named pipe was created by `chrome.exe`, which could suggest inter-process communication but may also indicate suspicious behavior like lateral movement or data transfer between processes.\n\nGiven these observations, it's recommended to:\n\n- Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell scripts and determine if they were authorized.\n- Review the registry modifications for signs of malicious activities.\n- Assess the network traffic, particularly around the DNS query event, for any unauthorized communication or exfiltration attempts."}
