{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"**Threat Analysis:**\n\n1. **Initial Activity:** A PowerShell script (`powershell.exe`) is executed with a command line that suggests it's creating scheduled tasks to run `calc.exe` at logon for the BUILTIN\\Administrators group, named \"unidade_comum\" and \"unidade_comum\".\n\n2. **Persistence Mechanism:** The scheduled tasks created will persist across reboots as they are set to trigger at logon. They will execute the `calc.exe` application which is a benign calculator but could be used as a smokescreen for malicious activities.\n\n3. **Evasion Tactics:**\n   - **Fileless Attack:** No files appear to be dropped or written to disk, suggesting this could be a fileless attack.\n   - **Scheduled Task Naming:** The scheduled task names (\"unidade_comum\") suggest attempts at blending in with potentially legitimate tasks.\n\n4. **Command & Control (C2):** There's no immediate indication of communication with a command and control server. However, the created scheduled tasks could be used to execute commands upon trigger.\n\n5. **Privilege Escalation:** The use of the BUILTIN\\Administrators group suggests privilege escalation as this group has high-level privileges on Windows systems.\n\n6. **Artifacts:**\n   - Temporary files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`\n   - The `.new` suffix on the winlogbeat yml file suggests attempted manipulation of configuration files.\n   - The `entrada_principal.txt` file created by PowerShell could contain relevant information or be used for further operations.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Disable or delete the suspicious scheduled tasks (\"unidade_comum\").\n- Monitor and analyze the `entrada_principal.txt` file for any unusual content.\n- Inspect the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file to understand what changes were attempted.\n- Consider reviewing permissions granted to the BUILTIN\\Administrators group.\n- Further investigation is needed to determine if this activity is part of a larger campaign or an isolated incident."}
