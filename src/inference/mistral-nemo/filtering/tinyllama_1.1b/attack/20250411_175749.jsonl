Initially, there are multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events without associated process or file details, which could indicate command-and-control (C2) communication. This is followed by the creation and execution of suspicious processes ('cmd.exe', 'WmiPrvSE.exe'), access to PowerShell, and modifications to the registry. Additionally, there's an unusual number of registry value set events involving 'chrome.exe'. The batch also includes file creation by 'powershell.exe', which could indicate data exfiltration or preparation for further malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
