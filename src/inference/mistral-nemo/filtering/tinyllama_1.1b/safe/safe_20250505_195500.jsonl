These files seem to be language packs for Word Editor Strings, suggesting some sort of localization or update process is occurring.\n- There's a security group management task reported, but no associated process was recorded.\n\nIf you're concerned about the repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`, you might want to investigate if it's an expected behavior or a potential threat. To do this, consider checking for any recent software installations, updates, or known malware activity on the system."}

The `<hash>` appears to be changing with each new file creation, suggesting these are likely cache or temporary files related to Office's AI Copilot feature.\n\n3. **Location**: All the files are being created in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n\n4. **Action**: The process is creating these files, indicating that it's likely performing some kind of update, cache creation, or data synchronization related to the Office AI Copilot feature.\n\nHere are a few things you might want to check:\n\n- Make sure your Office applications and their respective services (like SDXHelper) are running with the appropriate permissions.\n- Check if there are any ongoing updates or installations that might be triggering these file creations.\n- If these files are causing issues (like high disk usage or performance degradation), you might want to consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for further assistance, as they can provide guidance tailored to their software."}
