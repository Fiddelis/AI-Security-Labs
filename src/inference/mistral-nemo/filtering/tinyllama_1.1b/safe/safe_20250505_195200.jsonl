Here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **Timeline**: The events occurred in rapid succession, with each file creation happening almost immediately after the previous one.\n\n2. **File Prefix**: All the files start with `excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_`, suggesting they are related to Excel copilot strings for different tiers or versions.\n\n3. **Hash Values**: The hash values at the end of each filename (e.g., `_e64cd0dc47a02cb26603e95624caee39`) indicate that these are likely unique identifiers, possibly hashes of the content within those files.\n\n4. **Potential Issue**: Since many of these files seem to be overwritten (judging by the quick succession and similar prefixes), this could potentially lead to data loss or corruption if not properly managed.\n\n5. **Process Involved**: The process named `SDXHelper.exe` is involved in creating these files. This process is likely related to Microsoft Office, as `SDX` is often associated with Office applications.\n\nTo investigate this further:\n\n- Check the version of Microsoft Office installed on the system.\n- Monitor the file activity and disk space usage in the directory where these files are being created (C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\).\n- Ensure that there's enough disk space available to prevent unexpected overwrites or deletions due to lack of storage.\n- Keep an eye on any unusual behavior related to Excel, like sudden crashes, slow performance, or missing features."}
