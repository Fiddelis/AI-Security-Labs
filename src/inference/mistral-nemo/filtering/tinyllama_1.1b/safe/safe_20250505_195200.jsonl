This could indicate an error in the file creation process.\n\n2. **Frequency of File Creation**: The files are being created rapidly, suggesting that a script or application is running and generating these files at a high rate.\n\n3. **File Path**: All files are being saved to the same location under `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. This could indicate that the process creating these files is not designed to handle or manage large numbers of files in this location.\n\nHere are a few steps you might want to consider:\n\n- Check if there's any ongoing script, application, or service that might be causing this behavior.\n- If this is intended behavior (e.g., caching or temporary files), consider implementing file management practices such as deletion of old\/duplicate files, moving files to another location after processing, etc.\n- If this is unintended behavior, identify and stop the process creating these files.

This process is likely part of Microsoft Office and is responsible for handling solution packages and resources.\n\n3. **Timeline:**\n   - The logs show a sequence of file creations, suggesting that they occurred in quick succession, possibly during an update or initialization of some kind.\n\nHere's a list of the created files:\n\n- `excel-copilot-strings_032c15901c95404834bf14923c2468df.js`\n- `excel-copilot-strings_075fc70646104ae9ea617376c06a1bb3.js`\n- `excel-copilot-strings_091ef029ce5fe5d7b383c1a0235d4bef.js` (and many more, as shown in the logs)\n\nThe rest of the file names follow a similar pattern with random-looking strings. The actual content and purpose of these files are not specified in the given logs. They might contain language-specific strings used by Excel's Copilot feature for offline use."}

These files are located under the `\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` subdirectories and have names that suggest they're related to different Microsoft Office features, such as Excel's \"research workspace\" or speech-related services like `voiceaugloop`.\n\n3.

The operation that's causing these files to be created is likely related to the \"File created\" event, as indicated by the `task` field in your logs.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons for this behavior:\n\n- **Office Update**: Microsoft Office frequently updates its components and features, which might cause such file creation activities.\n- **Add-in\/Extension Installation or Update**: If you've recently installed or updated any add-ins, extensions, or plugins for Office, they could be causing these files to be created.\n- **Temporary Files**: These files could be temporary in nature, used by the Office processes and then deleted once their purpose is served.\n\nTo investigate this further:\n\n1. Check if there have been any recent updates to your Microsoft Office suite.\n2. Review any installed add-ins or extensions for Office.\n3.

Here are some observations:\n\n1. **File Prefix**: All the files have the same prefix, suggesting they might be related to the same task or process.\n\n2. **File Deletion**: After each file is created, it's deleted almost immediately. This could indicate that the process is attempting to write to these files but for some reason, it's unable to do so or the operation is being interrupted.\n\n3. **Process Involvement**: The \"SDXHelper.exe\" process seems to be responsible for these actions.

The content of the files is likely dynamic as different hashes\/strings are being used each time, indicating that the files are not static but rather generated on-the-fly.\n3. Since these events are logged with `File created (rule: FileCreate)` and there are no subsequent `File updated` or `File deleted` events, it suggests that the process is creating new files each time instead of updating existing ones.\n\nTo investigate this further:\n\n1. Check if there's any ongoing software update or installation related to Microsoft Office.\n2. Monitor the process `SDXHelper.exe` using a tool like Process Explorer (part of the Sysinternals suite by Microsoft) to see what it's doing while these files are being created.\n3.
