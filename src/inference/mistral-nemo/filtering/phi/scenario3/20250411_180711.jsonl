{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario3\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON logs, here's a summary of the activities:\n\n1. **Initial Activity**: The system boots up and starts `conhost.exe` process.\n\n2. **Powershell Executables**:\n   - Several instances of `powershell.exe` are executed with varying command lines:\n     - `powershell.exe & {}`\n     - `powershell.exe & {}` (repeated multiple times)\n     - `powershell.exe & {}`\n     - `powershell.exe & {}`\n   - These activities suggest the execution of PowerShell scripts or commands.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` is executed twice, indicating the start-up and possibly restart of Winlogbeat.\n   - It creates a `.yml.new` configuration file each time it runs.\n\n4. **Whoami Executables**:\n   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` are run with the command line `\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\"`. This is likely due to trying to identify the current user or system information.\n\n5. **File Operations**:\n   - Two PowerShell script files (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1` and `__PSScriptPolicyTest_4hg4ed55.wyg.ps1`) are created in the temp directory.\n   - Winlogbeat creates two `.yml.new` configuration files.\n\n6. **Registry Access**:\n   - `conhost.exe` accesses the registry once, indicating a typical startup behavior for this process type.\n   - There are no other registry-related events logged.\n\n7. **Process Interaction**:\n   - Numerous instances of `powershell.exe` processes accessing each other's memory, suggesting ongoing interaction between these processes during their lifetimes.\n\n8. **Timestamps**: The logs span over a period from '2023-03-16T15:49:07.492Z' to '2023-03-16T16:38:53.602Z', indicating approximately an hour and forty-nine minutes of activity.\n\nGiven the frequency of `powershell.exe` processes and their interaction, it suggests extensive use or manipulation of PowerShell scripts or commands during this timeframe. However, without additional context or deeper analysis, it's not possible to determine if any suspicious or malicious activities occurred."}
