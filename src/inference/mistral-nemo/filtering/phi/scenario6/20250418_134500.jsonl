This is expected behavior as the process is trying to access its own executable file for execution.\n\n3. **Process Accessed**\n   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process accessed another process, likely for inter-process communication or to retrieve some data.\n\n4. **Process Terminated**\n   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process was terminated twice in quick succession. This could indicate a crash or abnormal termination of the update process.\n\n5. **Registry Value Set**\n   - A process named `RuntimeBroker.exe` (which is a component used by Windows for tasks like running UAC prompts and other broker services) modified a value in the registry. The event log does not provide specifics about which key was modified or its new value.\n\nHere are some potential concerns:\n\n- The frequent termination of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could indicate instability with the update process, potentially leading to further issues if it occurs repeatedly.\n- The lack of detail in the logs about the specific registry modification made by `RuntimeBroker.exe` could make troubleshooting more difficult if any issues arise related to that change.\n\nTo investigate these events further, you might want to:\n\n- Check the system's update history and ensure there are no pending updates or known issues with Microsoft Edge.\n- Monitor the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process for stability in case it restarts or terminates frequently.\n- Keep an eye on the registry for any unwanted modifications related to the change made by `RuntimeBroker.exe`."}
