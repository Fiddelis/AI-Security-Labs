{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario2\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events that occurred:\n\n1. **Powershell Execution:**\n   - A user executed `whoami.exe`, likely to check their username or privileges.\n   - They then started another powershell instance with the command `powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}`. This command recursively lists files in the current directory and its subdirectories.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - Winlogbeat created or modified a `.yml` configuration file:\n     ```\n     File created (rule: FileCreate): C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n     ```\n   - Powershell created or modified a StartupProfileData-NonInteractive file:\n     ```\n     File created (rule: FileCreate): C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\n     ```\n\n3. **Registry Operations:**\n   - `conhost.exe` and `powershell.exe` both set registry values, but the logs do not specify which values were set or modified.\n\n4. **Network Activity (by Chrome):**\n   - Chrome made several network connections (`rule: NetworkConnect`) and performed a DNS query (`rule: DnsQuery`). However, these events are typical browser behavior and may not indicate any significant activity on their own.\n\n5. **Process Creation:**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was created with the command `& {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\ngci -recurse}`.\n\n6. **Image Loading (by Powershell):**\n   - Multiple powershell instances loaded several DLL files, including `mscoree.dll` and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. This is normal behavior for most applications loading required libraries.\n\n7. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A named pipe (`rule: PipeEvent`) was created by a powershell instance, but no further information about the purpose or content of this pipe is provided in the logs given."}
