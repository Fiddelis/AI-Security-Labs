This is a system tool that displays information about the current user, often used for simple privilege checks in penetration testing scripts.\n\n3. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A new file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new` was created in the winlogbeat directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`), suggesting configuration changes for Winlogbeat, a log shipping agent.\n\n4. **Potential Suspicious Activity**:\n   - The repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and PowerShell scripts, along with file creation and deletion in temporary folders, could indicate automated script activity or reconnaissance tasks.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Process**:\n   - A new instance of 'winlogbeat.exe' was started, which is likely related to log shipping or monitoring activities.\n\nTo further analyze the potential suspicious activity:\n\n- Check the contents of the executed scripts (if available) for better understanding of their purpose.\n- Verify if any unauthorized software or changes were installed on the system around this time.\n- Monitor network traffic for unusual outgoing connections.\n- Review the user account's permissions and access logs."}
