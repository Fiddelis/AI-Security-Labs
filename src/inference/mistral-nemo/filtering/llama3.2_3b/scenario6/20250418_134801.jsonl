This is typically due to npm installing packages and their dependencies.\n\nHere's what's happening based on the logs:\n\n1. **type**: The `type` indicates that these events are file creation operations.\n2. **process.name: git.exe**: This suggests that Git for Windows is being used, which might be related to npm operations like `install`, `update`, or `reinstall`.\n3. **file.path**: These paths show the files and directories being created within your project's `node_modules` folder.\n\nTo manage these events better:\n\n1. **Use npm ci instead of npm install:** If you're using npm 5.x or later, consider using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`. This command uses a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `.lock`) to preserve installed dependencies between installations.\n2. **Avoid unnecessary installations\/deletions:** Make sure you only install necessary packages and avoid installing packages that are no longer needed.\n3. **Consider using Yarn or pnpm:** These package managers also use lockfiles, but they offer faster installation times and better performance compared to npm.\n\nIf these suggestions don't help, please provide more context about what tasks or operations trigger these events so I can give a more targeted solution."}
