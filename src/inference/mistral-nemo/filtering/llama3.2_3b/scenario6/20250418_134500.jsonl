This is likely due to Windows scheduled task for updating Microsoft Edge.\n   - It then created `{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` folder.\n\n2. **File Operations**\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` deleted `{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` after the update process finished.\n   - `svchost.exe` created `content.phf` in the Delivery Optimization Cache folder, which is likely related to Windows Update delivery optimization feature.\n\n3. **Process Creation (Notepad)**\n   - Notepad (`notepad.exe`) was opened by the user. The command line shows no arguments, so it was likely opened from the start menu or via a shortcut.\n\n4. **File Modification**\n   - `MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` had its creation time changed to an earlier date (likely to make it appear older). This is often seen when installing software using an installer created with tools like Inno Setup or NSIS.\n\n5. **File Creation (Windows Update Log)**\n   - A new Windows Update log file `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.7.etl` was created in the `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate` folder. This is typical behavior whenever a Windows Update process completes.\n\nOverall, these logs seem to indicate routine Microsoft Edge updates and usual Windows activities with no apparent security concerns or anomalies detected by the system. However, if you have specific concerns about any of these events, it would be best to review them more closely or consult with a cybersecurity professional."}
