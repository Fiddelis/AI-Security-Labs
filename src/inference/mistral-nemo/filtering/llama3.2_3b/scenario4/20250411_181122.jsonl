{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario4\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event log data, here's a timeline of notable activities:\n\n1. **PowerShell Execution and File Operations**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) was created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` folder.\n   - The script was then deleted.\n\n2. **Process Creation and Access**\n   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other system processes were created and accessed.\n   - `calc.exe` (Calculator) and `winlogbeat.exe` were also observed in the process creation log.\n\n3. **File Creation**\n   - A `.yml.new` file was created in the Downloads folder, which could indicate an attempted configuration change for Winlogbeat (`winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64`).\n\n4. **DNS Query**\n   - `chrome.exe` performed a DNS query, suggesting internet activity possibly related to browsing or downloading.\n\nThese events suggest potential suspicious activities such as script execution and file operations involving PowerShell, multiple system process creations\/accesses, and possible configuration changes for monitoring tools like Winlogbeat. However, more context is needed to determine if these activities are malicious or not.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise:**\n- PowerShell script creation and deletion\n- Multiple instances of system processes being created\/accessed\n- Possible Winlogbeat configuration change\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Gather more contextual information about the events, such as user accounts involved, timestamps, and command-line arguments.\n- Correlate these events with other security logs (e.g., firewall, IDS, etc.) to understand their context better.\n- Review recent installations or updates that could be related to Winlogbeat."}
