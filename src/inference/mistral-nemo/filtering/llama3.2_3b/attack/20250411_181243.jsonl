This is followed by multiple ImageLoad events involving various DLL files associated with .NET Framework, suggesting potentially malicious activity such as code injection or execution of obfuscated malware. Additionally, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary PowerShell script file (.ps1) that is subsequently deleted in the next event. The repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events could indicate an attempt to evade detection by keeping the PowerShell process running continuously. Lastly, two net.exe processes are created consecutively, which might be related to the earlier PowerShell activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
