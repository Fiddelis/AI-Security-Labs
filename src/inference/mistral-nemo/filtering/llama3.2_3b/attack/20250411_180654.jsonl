First, a file named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' is created in an uncommon directory ('elemento_comum\\\\registro_principal\\\\elemento_secundario'). Then, this script is executed via PowerShell with command line argument '-LogPath'. This suggests the creation of a keylogger and its configuration to log keystrokes to a temporary file. Afterward, winlogbeat (a popular logging agent) processes these events, potentially indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity by blending it among legitimate logs.\"\n}"}
