You might want to investigate this further.\n- The three registry value set operations performed by Chrome could be indicative of malware attempting to modify system settings or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nTo investigate further, you can:\n1. Check the integrity of `SDXHelper.exe` and monitor its behavior closely.\n2. Inspect the registry for any unusual key modifications made by Chrome.\n3. Review the contents of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file created by Winlogbeat service start-up to ensure it's legitimate and doesn't contain unauthorized configurations."}
