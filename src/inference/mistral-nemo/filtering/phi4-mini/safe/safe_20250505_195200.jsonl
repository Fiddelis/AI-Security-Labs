This is likely a component of Microsoft Office.\n\n2. **File Creation Task:** All the events have the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This means that the SDXHelper process was creating files.\n\n3. **File Paths:** The paths where these files were created are all located in the same folder:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n   This suggests that these files are related to offline content or resources for Microsoft Office.\n\n4. **File Names:** The filenames are in the format \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_XXXXXXXX.js\". The XXXXXXXX part seems to be a unique identifier or hash, and \".js\" indicates that these are JavaScript files.\n\n5. **Event Timeline:** There are 16 events listed, which all happened on the same day (the date is not provided in your message). This could indicate either a one-time process of creating these files, or it could be that this process occurs daily at around the same time.\n\nWithout more context (like the full timeline of events, what was happening on the system at the time, etc.), it's difficult to determine if this is normal behavior for your system or if there might be a security concern. However, based solely on the information provided, these events do not appear to be malicious in nature."}

However, these timestamps are not provided in your question.\n\nIf you're seeing these logs repeatedly and you're concerned about it, I would suggest checking if there's any unknown or unwanted software running on your system that might be related to \"SDXHelper.exe\". It could also be a legitimate process, but if it's creating many files rapidly, it might indicate some issue like a software bug or malware. Always consider scanning your system with up-to-date antivirus\/antimalware tools for safety."}
