{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of the events that occurred on the system:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Installation and Configuration:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was created in the Downloads folder.\n   - `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file was created in the same directory.\n\n2. **System Processes:**\n   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` were active, with several registry events occurring.\n   - `Calculator.exe`, `setup.exe`, and `chrome.exe` were also executed.\n   - `smartscreen.exe` loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n   - `taskhostw.exe` loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n\n3. **Potential Threat or Anomaly:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` appeared suddenly and loaded several system DLLs (`combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) multiple times. This could be indicative of suspicious activity, as the name `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process, and its behavior (loading many DLLs) could suggest malware activity.\n\nHere's a breakdown by event type:\n\n- **Process Create:** 4 events (`winlogbeat.exe`, `setup.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `SDXHelper.exe`)\n- **Image Load:** 6 events (related to `smartscreen.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and multiple instances of `SDXHelper.exe`)\n- **Registry Event:** 12 events (mostly related to `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`)\n- **File Create:** 2 events (`setup.exe` created a temporary file, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new`)\n- **User Account Management:** 1 event (no process name available)\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Look into the appearance of `SDXHelper.exe` and its DLL load activity.\n- Check if any other unusual or malicious activities occurred around the same time.\n- Monitor for any unauthorized changes to registry values, files, or processes."}
