A process named `SDXHelper.exe` is creating multiple files with similar names but different content hashes (the strings after `.min_`). These files are located in:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\n   ```\n\n2. The files are related to `officeaicopilot-strings.min_` and their content appears to be different versions of minified JavaScript strings.\n\nHere are a few possibilities for why this might be happening:\n\n**A.** **Software Update\/Installation:** The `SDXHelper.exe` process could be associated with an update or installation of Microsoft Office software, which is creating or updating these files as part of its operation.\n\n**B. Corrupted Installation\/Incomplete Uninstall:** Conversely, if the installation of Microsoft Office is corrupted or there was an incomplete uninstall, it might cause this behavior due to errors in file creation or deletion.\n\n**C. Malware or Other Unwanted Software:** Although less likely given that the process is associated with a legitimate software company like Microsoft, there's still a possibility that malware or unwanted software might be causing these files to be created.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Check if the `SDXHelper.exe` process is related to any recent updates or installations of your Microsoft Office software.\n- Monitor the system for any unusual behavior or performance degradation.\n- Run a full system scan using reputable antivirus\/antimalware software to rule out any malicious activity.\n- If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Microsoft support or forum communities for assistance tailored to your specific software version and configuration."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's what's happening:\n\n1. **File Creation Events**: The majority of the logs indicate that a file named `officeaicopilot-strings.min` is being created in different versions (as indicated by the hashes following `officeaicopilot-strings.min_`). These files are located in the following directory:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c3d7fa79b05d1e1\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\n   ```\n\n2. **Process Involved**: The process `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with these file creation events. This suggests that the Microsoft Office Software Development Kit (SDK) Helper is responsible for creating these files.\n\n3. **Possible Reason**: The creation of these minified string resource files could be due to an update, modification, or installation process related to Microsoft Office. It's possible that these files are being generated as part of a localization or language pack installation or update.\n\n4. **No Error or Warning**: Since there are no error or warning messages in the logs, it suggests that this file creation process is normal and expected behavior under the current circumstances.\n\n5. **Duplicate Files**: Some of the logs show duplicate file entries (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_685611aa6ca3885619e5aad962528da5.js`), which could indicate either a temporary issue or normal behavior depending on the specific context and configuration."}

Here are some observations:\n\n1. **File Pattern**: All the created files follow this pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`. The `<hash>` part is changing, suggesting that these could be cached or updated versions of the same file.\n\n2. **Process Involved**: The process responsible for creating these files is `SDXHelper.exe`, which might be related to Microsoft Office.\n\n3. **Frequency and Duration**: The events are happening repeatedly and over a short duration, indicating a possible issue with the application or service that's managing these files.\n\nHere are some steps you might want to consider:\n\n- Check if there are any ongoing updates or installations for Microsoft Office.\n- Verify if there's an issue with the cache management system of your browser (if you're using one) or any other related software.\n- Monitor and analyze the behavior of `SDXHelper.exe` to ensure it's not causing any performance issues or security threats.\n- If the files are being created in a loop, you might want to check if there's an infinite loop or error condition that needs to be addressed."}

While this can be normal behavior for browser processes, the repetition of these events might suggest an anomaly:\n     ```\n     RegistryEvent: Registry value set\n     ```\n\n3. **Image Loads by chrome.exe:**\n   - Chrome browser loaded images from `urlmon.dll` and `MpClient.dll`. These are both legitimate Windows DLL files, but the repeated image loading could indicate unusual behavior.\n\nGiven these observations, it would be wise to:\n\n- Scan your system for any malware or unwanted software.\n- Monitor your system's performance for any unusual activity.\n- Keep an eye on the processes running on your system, and be cautious of any unknown or unfamiliar processes."}
