{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario5\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a summary of the provided logs, focusing on relevant security-related events and activities:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - A PowerShell script was executed multiple times with the following command:\n     ```\n     $command = @'\n     Get-LocalGroup | Format-Table Name,GroupFullName –AutoSize\n     Get-LocalUser | Format-Table Name,SamAccountName –AutoSize\n     whoami \/all\n     whoami\n     cmdkey \/list\n     exit\n     '@; Invoke-Expression -Command $command\n     ```\n   - This script retrieves local groups and users information, displays user details, lists credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager (`cmdkey`), and then exits.\n\n2. **Process Creation:**\n   - Several processes were created during this activity:\n     - `net.exe` (twice) and `net1.exe` (twice): These are likely related to querying network resources or groups.\n     - `cmdkey.exe`: This process is used to manage user credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager.\n     - `whoami.exe`: A simple command-line tool to display information about the current user.\n\n3. **File Operations:**\n   - Two files were created:\n     1. `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (likely a temporary file used during PowerShell script execution)\n     2. `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_logico.txt`: The purpose of this file is unclear, as it's not referenced in the provided logs.\n\n4. **Registry Operations:**\n   - Multiple registry value sets were recorded during this activity, likely unrelated to the PowerShell script execution (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, `notepad.exe`).\n\n5. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - Running `whoami \/all` and listing credentials with `cmdkey \/list` could indicate information gathering or privilege escalation attempts.\n   - The purpose of the created `elemento_logico.txt` file is unknown, and its content should be investigated for any suspicious activities.\n\nTo further investigate this incident:\n- Check if any unauthorized scripts were executed via PowerShell.\n- Investigate the purpose and content of the `elemento_logico.txt` file.\n- Monitor and analyze user activities related to `net.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.\n- Review the logs for any other suspicious activities or anomalies."}
