Here's how you can use them:\n\n1. **Installation**: If you haven't installed lodash yet, you can do so using npm or yarn:\n\n   Using npm:\n   ```\n   npm install lodash\n   ```\n\n   Using yarn:\n   ```\n   yarn add lodash\n   ```\n\n2. **Importing and usage**: After installation, you can import the lodash functions you need and use them in your TypeScript code.\n\n   For example, if you want to use `_.camelCase` function:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import { camelCase } from 'lodash';\n\n   const str = 'hello-WORLD';\n   console.log(camelCase(str)); \/\/ Outputs: helloWorld\n   ```\n\n3. **Using declaration files**: If you want type checking while using lodash, you can use the TypeScript declaration files.\n\n   You can install them via npm or yarn:\n\n   Using npm:\n   ```\n   npm install --save-dev @types\/lodash\n   ```\n\n   Using yarn:\n   ```\n   yarn add --dev @types\/lodash\n   ```\n\n   Then import and use lodash functions as before. TypeScript will now provide type checking for these functions.\n\n   ```typescript\n   import _ from 'lodash';\n\n   const arr = [1, 2, 3];\n   console.log(_.flatten(arr)); \/\/ Outputs: [1, 2, 3]\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder function names (`_.camelCase`, `_.flatten`) with the actual lodash functions you want to use. The above examples are just demonstrations of how to import and use lodash functions in TypeScript.\n\nAlso, ensure that your module resolution strategy supports importing modules using relative paths or make sure you have the correct path in your `tsconfig.json` file under the `\"types\"` option if you're using an absolute path."}
