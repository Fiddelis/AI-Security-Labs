{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario2\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summarized timeline of events:\n\n1. **User Activity:**\n   - The user interacted with Chrome (`chrome.exe`) and possibly other applications.\n   - They opened several files using unknown applications.\n\n2. **Suspicious Activity (Potential Threat):**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process was started, and it performed the following actions:\n     - It executed a command: `ls -recurse; get-childitem -recurse; ngci -recurse`. This is a series of commands to list files and directories recursively.\n     - It created a file in the user's AppData folder: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1`\n     - It deleted the same file shortly after creation.\n     - It created and interacted with unnamed pipes (`Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)`).\n   - These activities could indicate a malicious script or ransomware attack, but without more context, it's difficult to confirm.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - A `winlogbeat.exe` process was started, which created and interacted with several `.yml.new` files in the winlogbeat installation directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data`). This could indicate an attempt to modify or interfere with Winlogbeat configuration.\n\nHere are some recommendations based on these logs:\n\n- Scan your system for malware using up-to-date antivirus software.\n- Monitor your system and user accounts for any unusual activity.\n- Consider running a process monitor to track `powershell.exe` and other suspicious processes in the future.\n- Keep your software, including operating systems and applications, up-to-date with the latest security patches."}
