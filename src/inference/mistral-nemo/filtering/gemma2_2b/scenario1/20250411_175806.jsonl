{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario1\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"Here are the classifications and justifications for each log event:\n\n1. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is a common Windows process used for administrative tasks and script execution.\n\n2. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"whoami.exe\", \"command_line\": \"\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: The 'whoami' command is used to display the current Windows user's identity and is a normal part of system operation.\n\n3. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This could be an update or configuration change using PowerShell, but it's not malicious without further context.\n\n4. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"cmd.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to the previous entry, this could be a legitimate configuration change using Command Prompt.\n\n5. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"reg.exe\", \"command_line\": \"REG  ADD \\\"HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\"  \/V \\\"entrada_principal\\\"  \/t REG_SZ  \/F  \/D \\\"C:\\\\Path\\\\pacote_temporario.exe\\\"\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This appears to be an attempt to set up persistence by adding a registry key that launches 'pacote_temporario.exe'.\n\n6. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"reg.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This could be a legitimate registry change.\n\n7. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"cmd.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: Similar to log event 5, this appears to be another attempt at setting up persistence by modifying the registry.\n\n8. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"conhost.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: 'Conhost.exe' is a normal Windows process used to host console windows.\n\n9. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\modulo_padrao.txt'}\"}\n   - CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's Downloads folder, which could indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access.\n\n10. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"}\n    - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is a normal file creation event related to the Winlogbeat service.\n\n11. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n    - CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is another PowerShell process modifying registry values, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\n12. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\"},\"file\":\"None\"}\n    - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is a common Windows process used for administrative tasks and script execution.\n\n13. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"winlogbeat.exe\"},\"winlog\":{\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\"file\":\"{'path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'}\"}\n    - CLASSIFICATION: NOT INTERESTING, JUSTIFICATION: This is another normal file creation event related to the Winlogbeat service.\n\nThe 'Interesting' classifications indicate potential malicious or unusual activity that warrants further investigation."}
