{"file":"filtering\/gemma2_2b\/scenario1\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a summary of notable activities and potential security concerns:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities:**\n   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being created via PowerShell with no apparent user interaction.\n   - Frequent access to `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\wmiApRt` registry key by PowerShell processes.\n   - Possible indicative behaviors of a PowerShell-based attack, such as PowerSploit or Living Off The Land (LoL) techniques.\n\n2. **Chrome-related Events:**\n   - Frequent registry modifications (set value) by Chrome processes on various keys under `HKLM\\Software\\Policies` and `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion`.\n   - Multiple image loads by Chrome, including `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`, which are related to Windows Defender and its platform components.\n   - These activities might indicate policy configuration changes or suspicious behavior involving Chrome.\n\n3. **Other Notable Events:**\n   - Calculator (`calc.exe`) and Calculator application (`Calculator.exe`) loading the `urlmon.dll` image. This could suggest potential malicious activity, as this DLL is often associated with OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) vulnerabilities.\n   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` setting registry values under `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`.\n   - Creation of a named pipe (`Pipe Created`) by Chrome. This could indicate communication between processes, potentially for data exchange or command execution.\n\nTo investigate these activities further:\n\n- Enable advanced audit policies to capture more detailed event information.\n- Use threat hunting techniques and tools (e.g., YARA, Sigma rules) to search for related artifacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n- Monitor for any subsequent suspicious activities or anomalous behaviors on the system."}
