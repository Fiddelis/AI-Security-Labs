After a series of terminations, `powershell.exe` was created, followed by winlogbeat related activities.\n\nIf you're concerned about any malicious activity, I would recommend further investigation into the Microsoft Edge Update process and its network connections, as well as reviewing the actions taken by `powershell.exe`. However, based on the logs provided, these could also be regular system and application update or maintenance processes."}

However, the deletion of the initial executable file and creation of another in the Install folder might suggest a suspicious behavior (e.g., attempt to hide the original file).\n\n- **Winlogbeat:** The appearance of winlogbeat.exe could indicate that someone is trying to monitor or collect logs from this system.\n\nFor further investigation:\n- Check if there are any unusual or unauthorized changes in the registry.\n- Monitor network traffic for any unexpected outbound connections, especially related to Microsoft Edge Update activity.\n- Verify the purpose and source of winlogbeat.exe."}
