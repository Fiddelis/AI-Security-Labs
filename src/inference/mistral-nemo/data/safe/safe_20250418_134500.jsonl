{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events:\n\n1. **Microsoft Edge Update Service (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) Activity:**\n\n   - The service was started and began creating files:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\*.dll\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\n     ```\n   - It accessed other processes and loaded images, including its own executable and DLLs.\n   - The service made network connections (possibly to download updates).\n   - It terminated multiple times, which might be normal if the service is designed to run periodically or it could indicate an issue if it's terminating unexpectedly.\n\n2. **Registry Change:**\n\n   - `RuntimeBroker.exe` set a registry value. This could be related to Windows Defender Application Guard, as `RuntimeBroker.exe` is associated with this feature.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat (winlogbeat.exe) Activity:**\n\n   - A new process was created from the downloaded winlogbeat executable in the user's Downloads folder.\n   - It accessed another process (`powershell.exe`) and loaded its own image.\n   - Winlogbeat created a log file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\logs\\winlogbeat-20250418.ndjson`. This suggests that winlogbeat is now running and logging events to this file.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- The multiple terminations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could indicate a problem. You might want to check if it's supposed to run periodically or if there are any related error messages.\n- The creation of `winlogbeat.exe` process from the Downloads folder suggests that the executable was downloaded and may not have been installed via official channels, which could potentially pose a security risk if it's not from a trusted source. However, since winlogbeat is an Elastic Stack tool for log shipping, its presence might be expected in some environments.\n\n**Further Investigation:**\n\n- Check the `WindowsUpdate.etl` files created to see if there are any related error messages or unusual activities.\n- Monitor the behavior of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and ensure it's terminating as expected (if it should terminate at all) or investigate why it's terminating unexpectedly.\n- Verify the source and authenticity of the `winlogbeat.exe` executable in the Downloads folder, especially if it wasn't installed via official channels."}
