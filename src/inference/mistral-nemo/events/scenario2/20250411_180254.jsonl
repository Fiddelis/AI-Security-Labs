{"file":"events\/scenario2\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of events:\n\n1. **Process Start\/End and Pipe Creation:**\n   - Several processes started and ended, including `powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe`.\n   - A pipe was created by `chrome.exe`.\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` created the file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` twice.\n   - `powershell.exe` created a file named `objeto_padrao.txt`.\n\n3. **Registry Value Changes:**\n   - Many registry value changes were made by various processes (`powershell.exe`, `chrome.exe`, etc.). These changes are quite common and don't necessarily indicate malicious activity.\n\n4. **Image Loading:**\n   - `chrome.exe` loaded several images, including `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`. This is typical behavior for Chrome as it loads necessary libraries to function properly.\n\n5. **Pipe Event:**\n   - A pipe was created by `chrome.exe`, which could indicate communication with another process or service.\n\n6. **Potentially Suspicious Activity:**\n   - The creation of the `objeto_padrao.txt` file by `powershell.exe` could potentially be suspicious, especially if it's not expected behavior in your environment. Further investigation might be warranted.\n\n7. **No Signs of Malware or Anomalous Behavior:**\n   - Based on these logs alone, there are no obvious signs of malware or anomalous behavior other than the file creation mentioned above. However, this is a limited view and further analysis with more context would be required for definitive conclusions."}
