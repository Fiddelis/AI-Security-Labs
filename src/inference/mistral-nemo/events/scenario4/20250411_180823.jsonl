{"file":"events\/scenario4\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided Windows Event Log data, here's a summary of notable activities:\n\n1. **Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` processes were frequently accessed and created registries values, which could indicate the execution of scheduled tasks or scripts.\n   - Several registry values were set in locations like `HKLM\\...\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System`, `HKLM\\...\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options`, and `HKLM\\...\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`.\n\n2. **Task Scheduler:**\n   - A `taskschd.exe` process was observed, which is associated with the Task Scheduler service in Windows.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Installation:**\n   - There's an entry for `winlogbeat.exe`, indicating that it created a `.yml.new` file in the user's Downloads folder, suggesting an installation or configuration of Winlogbeat.\n\n4. **PowerShell Activities:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes were accessed and created files, modified registry values, and accessed other processes.\n   - A `whoami.exe` process was created from PowerShell, which could indicate enumeration activities.\n\n5. **Potential Anomalies:**\n   - There are many entries related to `chrome.exe`, including creating pipes, accessing registries, and loading DLLs. While this could be normal browser behavior, the high frequency of these events might suggest unusual activity.\n   - The creation of a text file (`unidade_ativo.txt`) by PowerShell in the user's Downloads folder is notable.\n\nTo better understand the context and potential threats, you would want to:\n\n- Gather more information about the `powershell.exe` activities, especially around the created files and modified registry values.\n- Investigate the high frequency of `chrome.exe` related events for any signs of unusual behavior or indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Look into any other processes or activities that occurred around the same time as the notable events mentioned above."}
