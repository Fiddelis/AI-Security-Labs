{"file":"events\/scenario4\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log events, here are my classifications:\n\n**Interesting:**\n1. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"cmd.exe\", \"command_line\": \"\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Internet Explorer\\\\iexplore.exe http:\/\/www.google.com\\\"\"}, \"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\"}}\n   - This event shows a command line with a URL, which could indicate suspicious behavior or an exploit.\n\n2. {\"process\":{\"name\": \"powershell.exe\"}}, {\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", \"file\": {\"path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_secundario.txt\"}}}\n   - A PowerShell process creating a new file could indicate an attempted malicious activity.\n\n3. Several events involving the same process (\"chrome.exe\") with consecutive registry value sets could indicate a script or automated behavior:\n   - {\"process\":{\"name\": \"chrome.exe\"}}, {\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\"}} (repeated 21 times)\n\n**Not Interesting \/ Normal Behavior:**\n- Most of the events involve common processes (like chrome.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe) performing normal tasks such as registry value sets, pipe creations, or file creations.\n- Some events involve PowerShell (\"powershell.exe\") executing normal commands or creating files, which might be expected in some contexts.\n\nTo better assess the potential threat level, consider combining these logs with other contextual information, such as timing, frequency, and specific command-line arguments."}
