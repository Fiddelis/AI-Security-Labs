{"file":"events\/scenario1\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summary of activities and potential security concerns:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activities:**\n   - A PowerShell script was run (possibly malicious) that created several temporary files:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpE3F80D6.tmp`\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp07AC52C.tmp`\n   - The script attempted to execute various commands, including accessing the registry (`HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Winmgmt`), which could indicate an attempt at persistence or privilege escalation.\n   - Temporary files were later deleted:\n     ```\n     Remove-Item 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp07AC52C.tmp'\n     Remove-Item 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpE3F80D6.tmp'\n     ```\n\n2. **Whoami.exe Executions:**\n   - The script triggered multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, suggesting possible reconnaissance or information gathering about the system and users.\n\n3. **Registry Access (Chrome & RuntimeBroker):**\n   - Chrome and RuntimeBroker made several registry changes, which could indicate normal behavior but might also suggest potential unwanted activities such as browser hijacking or other malicious modifications.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activities:**\n   - Winlogbeat service created a new YAML configuration file:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n     ```\n   - This could indicate an attempt to reconfigure logging or exfiltrate data, depending on the changes made in the YAML file.\n\nTo investigate further:\n\n- Identify the PowerShell script's origin and purpose.\n- Review the contents of the created and modified files (e.g., `tmpE3F80D6.tmp`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n- Monitor for any unauthorized or unusual network connections, especially those involving data exfiltration.\n- Scan the system for any signs of malware, such as persistent threats or backdoors."}
