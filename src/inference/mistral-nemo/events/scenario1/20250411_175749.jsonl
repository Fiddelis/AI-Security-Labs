{"file":"events\/scenario1\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided log data, here's a summary of significant events and potential threats detected:\n\n1. **System Information:**\n   - Operating System: Windows\n   - User: fiddelis\n\n2. **Potential Threats:**\n\n   - **Persistence Mechanism Detected:** A temporary file named `modulo_temporario.txt` was created by PowerShell, which could be indicative of a script or malware trying to establish persistence.\n\n   - **Multiple Registry Value Changes by Chrome:** There were numerous registry value changes made by the 'chrome.exe' process. This behavior might indicate malicious activity, such as browser hijacking or malware exploiting Chrome's processes.\n     - Affected Registry Keys: Not specified in the log data provided.\n\n3. **Other Notable Events:**\n\n   - **Process Creation:**\n     - Two `svchost.exe` processes were created with different command-line arguments, potentially indicating separate services running.\n       - First instance: `-k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p -s NgcSvc`\n       - Second instance: `-k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted -p -s NgcCtnrSvc`\n\n   - **Logon Events:**\n     - Two logon events occurred, one regular ('Logon') and another special ('Special Logon'). The 'special' logon event does not provide details on the type of logon.\n\n4. **Behavioral Analysis:**\n\n   - The creation of multiple temporary files by PowerShell (`modulo_temporario.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new`) could indicate suspicious script execution or malware activity.\n   - Frequent registry value changes by Chrome might suggest browser hijacking, malicious extensions, or malware exploiting Chrome's processes.\n\nTo investigate further:\n- Monitor and analyze the activities of 'powershell.exe' and 'chrome.exe'.\n- Check for any unauthorized scripts or software running on the system.\n- Inspect the registry keys changed by Chrome to determine if they are related to legitimate browser functionality or malicious activity.\n- Review the '.winlogbeat.yml.new' file to understand its purpose, as it was created twice in rapid succession."}
