{"file":"events\/scenario1\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a summarized timeline of events:\n\n1. **Chrome Activity** (multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `SDXHelper.exe`)\n   - Several registry values were set by `conhost.exe`.\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` loaded several system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `combase.dll`).\n\n2. **Microsoft Edge Update** (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`)\n   - A new process was created with the command line argument `\/ua \/installsource scheduler`.\n   - It loaded the `taskschd.dll` file.\n   - Another process, `backgroundTaskHost.exe`, also loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity** (`powershell.exe`)\n   - A new PowerShell process was created.\n   - It accessed another PowerShell process (ProcessAccess).\n   - It created a file named `modulo_base.txt`.\n   - Registry values were set by this PowerShell process.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity** (`winlogbeat.exe`)\n   - The winlogbeat process created a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file.\n\n5. **Command Prompt Activity** (`net.exe`, `net1.exe`)\n   - A command prompt process was created to execute `localgroup`.\n   - Another process, `powershell.exe`, accessed this command prompt process.\n   - A new process named `net1.exe` was created with the command line argument `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1 localgroup`.\n\nThese logs suggest several activities involving web browsers, Windows system processes, PowerShell, and a logbeat agent. The multiple instances of PowerShell processes and their interactions warrant further investigation for potential security risks or suspicious behavior."}
