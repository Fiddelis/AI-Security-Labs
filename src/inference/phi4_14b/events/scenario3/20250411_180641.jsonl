Hereâ€™s an organized summary of the key elements in the logs:\n\n### Process Events\n\n1. **PowerShell (`powershell.exe`)**\n   - Accessed: Multiple instances noted for process access.\n   - Registry Changes: Multiple entries where registry values were set.\n\n2. **Calculator (`calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe`)**\n   - Image Loaded: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll`.\n   - Registry Changes: Noted in several entries.\n\n3. **Chrome (`chrome.exe`)**\n   - Pipe Created: Indicated creation of a named pipe.\n   - Registry Changes: Multiple instances where registry values were set.\n   - Image Loaded: Two DLLs loaded:\n     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll`\n     - `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll`\n\n4. **Notepad (`notepad.exe`)** \n   - Registry Changes: Noted in a single entry.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat (`winlogbeat.exe`)**\n   - File Created: Two identical entries about creating `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n\n6. **Other Processes:**\n   - **Conhost:** Registry change noted.\n   - **SVCHOST:** Multiple registry changes recorded.\n   - **ApplicationFrameHost:** Registry change noted.\n\n### File and Image Load Events\n\n- Several entries indicate files being created or images (DLLs) being loaded during the execution of processes. Notably:\n  - The `winlogbeat.exe` process created a file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n  - The `chrome.exe` process loaded important system DLLs related to security (`amsi.dll`) and Windows Defender (`MpOAV.dll`).\n\n### Registry Events\n\n- Many entries detail changes in the registry, which is common for processes that require configuration or permission updates. Notably:\n  - Processes like Chrome, PowerShell, Calculator, etc., have several instances of registry value modifications.\n\nThis summary highlights recurring patterns such as frequent registry access by `powershell.exe` and multiple instances where `chrome.exe` modifies registry values, potentially indicating significant interaction with system settings or configurations. Each entry can be critical for understanding the behavior of applications on a Windows system, especially in security audits or troubleshooting scenarios."}
