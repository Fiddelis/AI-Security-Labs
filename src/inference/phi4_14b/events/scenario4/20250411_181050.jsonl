Notably, 'certutil.exe' is used in a manner consistent with encoding and decoding operations often associated with obfuscation techniques to evade detection (e.g., creating encoded files using `certutil -encode` and decoding them back into executables). The command lines involving `cmd.exe` executing `certutil` for encoding\/decoding tasks indicate potential use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes. Additionally, there are multiple instances of registry value modifications (`RegistryEvent`) without clear benign intent across different processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`. Registry changes are often used by malware to establish persistence or modify system settings to facilitate further malicious activity. The 'Image loaded' events for `SDXHelper.exe` with the same DLL path (`combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`) suggest potential use of a loader or similar mechanism, which is sometimes indicative of malware injecting code into legitimate processes to hide its presence. The frequent network connections by `chrome.exe`, although it may be benign in some contexts, combined with these other suspicious activities raise the overall level of concern.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
