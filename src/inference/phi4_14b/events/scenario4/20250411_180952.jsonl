The process 'cmd.exe' was used with commands to add users and modify the Domain Admins group, which is typically associated with privilege escalation attempts. Additionally, the creation of registry entries by various processes like conhost.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe suggests possible persistence mechanisms or system manipulation. Frequent file creations with specific paths (e.g., winlogbeat configuration) could indicate logging redirection or tampering. The repeated access to svchost.exe for file creation also warrants further investigation due to its potential exploitation in malware campaigns.\"\n}\n```"}
