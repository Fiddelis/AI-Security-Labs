The use of chrome.exe to perform tasks typically reserved for administrative tools is suspicious and could suggest code injection or misuse by an attacker to elevate privileges without detection. Additionally, repeated registry modifications via known command-line utilities like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can indicate attempts at persistence or configuration changes that might evade standard security measures.\"\n}\n```"}
