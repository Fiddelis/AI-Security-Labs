The use of 'whoami.exe' can also be associated with information gathering by potential attackers. Additionally, the use of 'WMIC.exe' to load various critical system DLLs is noteworthy because this tool can execute commands that affect Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or perform actions on remote machines, which may be leveraged for unauthorized activities.\"\n}\n```"}
