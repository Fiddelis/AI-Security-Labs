Additionally, there is a registry modification using `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe` to add entries under HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run. Such modifications often suggest persistence mechanisms being established by an attacker to maintain access or execute scripts upon user login. The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files could be related to monitoring tool configuration, but in this context, combined with other suspicious activities, raises concern about potential security bypass or misconfiguration exploitation.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
