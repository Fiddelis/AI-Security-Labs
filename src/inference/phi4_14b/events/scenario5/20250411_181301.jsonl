The frequent use of powershell.exe for both process access and registry modifications is notable as it can indicate automated scripts or command execution typical in malicious activity. Additionally, tasklist.exe loading critical system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, along with repeated image load events, could suggest attempts to bypass security measures. The creation of new files by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe suggests possible data exfiltration or tampering with system configurations.\"\n}\n```"}
