Notably, the use of `powershell.exe` to create a file (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\pacote_base.txt`) is suspicious as PowerShell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly exploited by attackers for executing scripts or commands. Additionally, the `attrib.exe` command being used with a process creation event to set hidden attributes on a specific file (`C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\elemento_logico.txt`) suggests an attempt to conceal files. The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a script with elevated privileges (elevated by using `attrib.exe +h` on `%temp%\\\\estrutura_padrao.txt`) is also concerning, as this could be part of an obfuscation or privilege escalation tactic. Multiple instances of registry values being set (`RegistryEvent`) by various processes such as `svchost.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, and `chrome.exe` are worth investigating further for unauthorized modifications.\"\n}\n```"}
