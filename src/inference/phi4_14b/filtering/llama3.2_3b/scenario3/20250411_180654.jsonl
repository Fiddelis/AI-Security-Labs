Multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' executing a script named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1', which is commonly associated with keylogging malware. This points to potential malicious behavior aimed at capturing user keystrokes.\\n\\n2. A PowerShell process accessed files for deletion ('File Delete logged') and executed scripts in temporary locations, which are often tactics used by malware to evade detection and persist on a system.\\n\\n3. 'winlogbeat.exe' is seen creating files multiple times in the same location. Although Winlogbeat itself is legitimate, repeated creation of similar files can be suspicious depending on context.\\n\\nThese activities collectively suggest potential malicious behavior and warrant further investigation.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
