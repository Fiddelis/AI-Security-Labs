Key indicators include:\\n\\n1. Execution of batch files via PowerShell: Two separate instances where 'powershell.exe' is used to execute batch files located in directories with names suggesting an attempt at obfuscation or unconventional naming conventions (e.g., \\\"objeto_secundario\\\", \\\"pacote_comum\\\"). These patterns are often associated with attempts to bypass security controls.\\n\\n2. Creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script: A '.ps1' file is created in the Temp directory, followed by its immediate deletion. This pattern suggests an attempt to execute scripts without leaving lasting evidence on the system, which is commonly seen in malware execution tactics.\\n\\n3. Execution of commands from command-line interfaces (cmd.exe) to run a batch script: The use of 'cmd.exe' with a direct path to execute a potentially malicious batch file further underscores suspicious activity, especially when combined with PowerShell usage.\\n\\n4. Registry event activities and image loading related to known system components ('chrome.exe', 'svchost.exe') without clear context could be benign but warrant scrutiny if correlated with the above behaviors as part of a larger attack chain.\\n\\nOverall, the combination of executing scripts from unconventional locations, obfuscation techniques (e.g., indirect execution through PowerShell), and the creation\/deletion of files in a manner consistent with avoiding detection, classify these events as 'INTERESTING' due to their potential link to malicious activities.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
