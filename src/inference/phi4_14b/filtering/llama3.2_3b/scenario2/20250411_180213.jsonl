This behavior is indicative of a potential privilege escalation attack, where an attacker aims to gain elevated access on the system. Additionally, loading urlmon.dll into Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe suggests DLL hijacking or code injection attempts, which are also concerning indicators of malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
