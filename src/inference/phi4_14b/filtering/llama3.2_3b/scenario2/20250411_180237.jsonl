The presence of processes such as `powershell.exe` with access events and `whoami.exe` could suggest potential reconnaissance activities, as these are commonly used for gathering system information or executing commands. While individual entries like tasklist operations on standard system files (`amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) might seem benign, the context of repeated file creations and execution of known system tools raises suspicion about their purpose in this environment.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
