These activities are often associated with malicious intent such as keylogging or data exfiltration. Additionally, there's evidence of file creation (`FileCreate`) and deletion (`FileDeleteDetected`) for a PowerShell script in the user's temporary directory, which further suggests suspicious behavior. The repeated use of `Engine Lifecycle` events in the context of these scripts raises additional concerns about automation or orchestration of malicious activities. Moreover, `ImageLoad` events concerning Windows Defender components suggest potential attempts to bypass security mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
