The use of 'powershell.exe' with tasks related to accessing processes and setting registry values is often associated with sophisticated attack techniques.\\n2. Command-line executions involving 'cmd.exe' and 'net.exe' to add users to the Domain Admins group are indicative of privilege escalation attempts.\\n3. There are multiple events where a non-standard executable, 'net1.exe', is used in command-line operations that mirror privileged actions ('net user', 'net group'), suggesting potential malicious activity or system compromise.\\n4. The repeated creation of the same file by 'winlogbeat.exe' could indicate tampering or an attempt to maintain persistence.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
