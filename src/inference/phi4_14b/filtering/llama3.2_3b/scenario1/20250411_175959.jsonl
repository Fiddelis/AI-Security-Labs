Additionally, the creation of a new file ('C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\pacote_ativo.txt') by 'powershell.exe' could indicate that data is being prepared for exfiltration. Furthermore, the deletion of a process through an unauthorized or uncommon command (as seen with 'net1 user') also raises concerns about potential malicious activity. Collectively, these events suggest an attempt to gain unauthorized access and control over system resources.\"\n}\n```"}
