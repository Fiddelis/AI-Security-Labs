{"file":"filtering\/phi\/scenario6\/20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log appears to show a series of file creation events captured by Windows' audit system, specifically indicating that the process `git.exe` created various files. This typically occurs when running commands like `npm install`, which uses Git under the hood to clone repositories and manage dependencies.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n- **Files Created:** The log lists numerous paths where files were created within the `node_modules` directory of a project, indicating that npm (Node.js package manager) was installing various packages.\n  \n  - Packages like `type-fest`, `url-parse-lax`, `whatwg-url`, `undici-types`, and others are part of the dependencies installed for the Node.js application.\n\n- **Process:** The process responsible is `git.exe`. This suggests that Git operations were part of the dependency installation, which is common when npm resolves packages from repositories on GitHub or other version control systems.\n\nIf this log was generated as a result of an npm install operation, here's what likely happened:\n\n1. **NPM Install Command:** Running `npm install` in your project directory starts the process to download and set up all dependencies listed in `package.json`.\n\n2. **Dependency Resolution:** Npm fetches these packages from npm registry or directly from Git repositories if specified as a Git URL.\n\n3. **File Creation:** As each package is downloaded, its files are extracted into the `node_modules` directory. This involves creating directories and files for various modules being installed (like those listed).\n\n4. **Audit Logging:** Windows Security logs these file creation events when auditing is enabled, capturing details about the process and actions performed.\n\nThis scenario illustrates a typical development workflow where npm manages project dependencies, leveraging Git for version control operations as needed. If you were reviewing such logs to troubleshoot or verify installations, you would look at these entries to confirm which files were created during your last installation command."}
