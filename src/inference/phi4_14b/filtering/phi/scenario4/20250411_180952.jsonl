The creation of a user with the name 'pacote_principal_Admin' and adding it to the 'Domain Admins' group using both cmd.exe and net.exe is suspicious as it indicates an attempt to escalate privileges. Additionally, modifications of registry values by various processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe) and unusual process activity (net1.exe with a non-standard path) suggest unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
