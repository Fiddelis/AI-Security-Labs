Such patterns can be indicative of attempts to move laterally within a system or access unintended files. Additionally, these PowerShell invocations use the `Start-Process` cmdlet to execute batch files located in unusual directories. This behavior is suspicious as it deviates from normal administrative tasks and could indicate malicious activity such as executing payloads or scripts for persistence.\"\n\n    \"Furthermore, the process events include `RegistryEvent` actions involving multiple different processes (`chrome.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`), which could be attempts at modifying system configurations or hiding tracks. This is particularly suspicious when combined with other signs of potential malicious activity.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
