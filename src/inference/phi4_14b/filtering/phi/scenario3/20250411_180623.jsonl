Specifically, several instances of 'Image loaded' tasks related to critical system files (clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll) being loaded by 'powershell.exe' are unusual in typical operations and may suggest code injection or loading malicious libraries. Additionally, there is a log entry for the creation of a file at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', indicating potential attempts to modify PowerShell startup profiles, which could be used to execute unwanted commands or scripts upon user login. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' for simple date retrieval commands ('Get-Date') is suspiciously repetitive and may indicate an attempt to obscure other activities or script execution.\"\n}\n```"}
