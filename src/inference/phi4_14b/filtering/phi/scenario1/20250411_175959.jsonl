Multiple instances of PowerShell command-line activities performing system enumeration and credential dumping tasks such as 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-childitem C:\\\\Users', 'cmdkey.exe \/list'. These commands are indicative of privilege escalation attempts or information gathering typically associated with lateral movement in a compromised environment.\",\n    \"2. A file deletion event involving a PowerShell script, which may indicate attempts to remove traces of malicious activity.\",\n    \"3. The repeated and identical execution of the potentially malicious command-line operations using 'powershell.exe', which is suspicious due to its consistency and lack of variation.\",\n    \"4. Creation and modification events involving registry keys by both 'powershell.exe' and other processes, suggesting attempts at persistence or configuration changes that might facilitate further malicious activities.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
