Specifically, multiple instances of 'Process accessed' with `powershell.exe` suggest attempts to access or interact with processes in a manner often associated with privilege escalation or data exfiltration techniques. Additionally, the repeated use of `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and even `whoami.exe` for gathering system information (via task list, image loading, and user identity checks) indicates possible reconnaissance activity. The creation of files using `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` also warrants attention, as it could be related to data manipulation or exfiltration efforts.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
