The log shows multiple uses of `powershell.exe` with the `-ep bypass` parameter, indicating potential malicious intent to bypass execution policies, particularly in command lines associated with non-existing script paths (e.g., 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'). This is a common tactic used by attackers to run unauthorized scripts.\\n\\n2. There are commands involving `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks with the same suspicious PowerShell command, which indicates an attempt to persist malicious activities on the system.\\n\\n3. The use of 'cmd.exe' for creating and querying scheduled tasks suggests an effort to automate the execution of potentially harmful scripts, adding another layer of persistence.\\n\\n4. Multiple `svchost.exe` processes setting registry values could be indicative of a compromised service or an attempt by malware to maintain persistence through system services, though this alone may not be conclusive without further context.\\n\\n5. The frequent use of `chrome.exe` for registry value sets can suggest that Chrome extensions or other browser-based mechanisms are being manipulated, potentially indicating the presence of web-based threats or unwanted software modifications.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
