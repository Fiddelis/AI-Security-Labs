The process `cmd.exe` is used to create a scheduled task (`win32times`) that attempts to execute a non-existing script (`c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1`). This behavior could be indicative of an attacker setting up malicious scripts for execution.\\n\\n2. Multiple entries show the use of `powershell.exe` with registry value settings and process access, which can sometimes indicate unauthorized configuration changes or attempts to escalate privileges.\\n\\n3. The process `RuntimeBroker.exe`, typically associated with UWP apps in Windows 10\/11 environments, is setting a registry value. This might suggest an attempt to manipulate its behavior for malicious purposes.\\n\\n4. The use of `svchost.exe` and `services.exe` multiple times to set registry values can be suspicious if not part of standard system operations, as these processes are commonly used by legitimate Windows services but can also be exploited for executing arbitrary code or modifying the system.\\n\\n5. The frequent setting of registry values via common executables such as `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and even benign applications like `Calculator.exe` is unusual and may suggest attempts to maintain persistence, execute unauthorized commands, or modify system behavior.\\n\\n6. `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file with a new configuration suggests a potential attempt at modifying or setting up logging configurations for further analysis evasion or data exfiltration.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
