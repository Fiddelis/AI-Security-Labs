Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` accessing and setting registry values are observed, indicating potential misuse for malicious activities such as persistence or privilege escalation.\",\n    \"2. The use of `cmd.exe` with the command line to create scheduled tasks (`schtasks`) that execute `calc.exe` suggests possible attempts at unauthorized system changes or testing of execution capabilities on startup\/logon events.\",\n    \"3. The consistent registry value setting by `svchost.exe`, combined with file creation for task scheduling, could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence through scheduled tasks.\",\n    \"4. Execution of `whoami.exe` via a process create event is unusual in regular system operations and may signify reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
