Additionally, there are attempts to modify the startup registry keys using `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which can be indicative of persistence mechanisms being established by malicious actors. The repeated use of scripts or commands that alter system configurations (like registry entries for auto-run programs) is often a sign of potential compromise or malicious behavior.\"\n}\n```"}
