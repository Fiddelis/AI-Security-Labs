Additionally, there are several entries involving 'powershell.exe' accessing processes or setting registry values, combined with other suspicious activities like creating scheduled tasks ('WmiPrvSE.exe') and establishing pipes ('Pipe Created'). The sequence and variety of these events suggest potential malicious behavior aimed at maintaining persistence, executing scripts, and possibly communicating with an external command-and-control server.\"\n}\n```"}
