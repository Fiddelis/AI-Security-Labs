Specifically, the creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script file in the temporary directory ('C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1') raises suspicion due to its common use as a tactic by attackers to execute scripts that might bypass security controls. Additionally, PowerShell being used for various tasks like image loading and registry modification further adds context for potential abuse of legitimate processes for malicious purposes.\"\n}\n```"}
