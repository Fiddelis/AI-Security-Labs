The repeated use of `powershell.exe` and `schtasks.exe` for creating scheduled tasks that attempt to execute PowerShell scripts from non-existing paths (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1) is suspicious, as it may indicate an attempt to dynamically generate or retrieve malicious scripts. The process creation events for `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`, combined with the use of command-line options like `-ep bypass -file`, are indicative of attempts to elevate privileges and execute code with fewer restrictions. Additionally, the frequent registry modifications by different processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`) without associated file actions or context could suggest unauthorized changes being made for persistence or other malicious purposes.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
