These processes are being used in ways that might indicate attempts at privilege escalation or system manipulation, such as creating processes via command-line instructions, setting registry values, and loading image files, which may be part of evasion techniques. Additionally, the file creation activities observed with powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe could suggest data exfiltration or configuration modification attempts.\"\n}\n```"}
