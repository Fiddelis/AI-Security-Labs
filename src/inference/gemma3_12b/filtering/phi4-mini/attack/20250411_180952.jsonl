The creation of user accounts within the domain, specifically adding users to the 'Domain Admins' group, strongly suggests unauthorized privilege escalation and potential compromise.  The presence of winlogbeat and powershell activity related to file creation also warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
