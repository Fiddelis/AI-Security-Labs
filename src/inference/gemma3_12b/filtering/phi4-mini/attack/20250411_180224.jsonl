Additionally, the repeated registry modifications by `svchost.exe` and the creation of a scheduled task named 'win32times' are concerning. The use of non-existent file names in PowerShell script execution further strengthens suspicion. The other events such as `winlogbeat.exe` creating files and Chrome registry modifications appear less concerning but contribute to a generally busy environment that could mask malicious behavior. The combined activity warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
