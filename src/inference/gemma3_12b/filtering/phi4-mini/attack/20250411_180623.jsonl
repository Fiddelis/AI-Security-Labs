Specifically, a PowerShell script is created, immediately deleted, and a StartupProfileData file is modified. This pattern, coupled with frequent PowerShell activity, suggests a potential scripting attack or unusual automated behavior warranting investigation. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events further indicate PowerShell engine activity. The creation of winlogbeat configuration files also is unusual.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
