The loading of urlmon.dll and amsi.dll within the context of Excel is noteworthy, as it could indicate attempts to interact with URLs or evade detection. Furthermore, Excel's involvement in DNS queries is atypical and warrants investigation. The presence of RuntimeBroker.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe events also adds complexity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
