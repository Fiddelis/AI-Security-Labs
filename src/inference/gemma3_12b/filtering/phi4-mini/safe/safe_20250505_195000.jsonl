The PowerShell activity is suspicious due to the use of temporary files and potentially bypassing security measures. The 'SDXHelper.exe' DNS queries warrant further investigation to determine their destination. The combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity or reconnaissance.\"\n}\n```"}
