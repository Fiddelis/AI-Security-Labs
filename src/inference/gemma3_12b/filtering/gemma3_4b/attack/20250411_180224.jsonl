The scripts reference non-existent files ('c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'), suggesting potential obfuscation or an attempt to download and execute malicious code.  The frequent registry modifications by `svchost.exe` and Chrome are likely benign but merit further scrutiny in conjunction with the scheduled task creation. The creation of scheduled tasks in the system task folder ('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\win32times') with 'system' user context is particularly concerning. Finally, the frequent activity involving PowerShell and Chrome, and the multiple file creation events by `winlogbeat.exe` suggests a possible download and deployment scenario or a compromised machine.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
