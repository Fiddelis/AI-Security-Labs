The scripts reference non-existent files (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1, c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1), which could be indicators of obfuscation or attempts to avoid detection. Several `schtasks.exe` events and related PowerShell execution warrant further investigation for potential malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or unauthorized script execution.\"\n}\n```"}
