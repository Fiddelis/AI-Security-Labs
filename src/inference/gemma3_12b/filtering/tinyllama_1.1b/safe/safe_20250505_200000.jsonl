Several image loads from suspicious locations (`urlmon.dll`) are also present, along with repeated 'Special Logon' events and file creation related to `winlogbeat.exe`. The sheer volume of registry modifications coupled with the image load patterns suggests potential unauthorized activity or unusual system changes warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
