The appearance of temporary PowerShell scripts (teste.ps1, __PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1) suggests potential script execution, warranting investigation. Furthermore, the 'Execute a Remote Command' event is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. While some events are benign (e.g., winlogbeat-related activity), the overall pattern points towards suspicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
