This pattern strongly suggests keylogging activity. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion events associated with PowerShell, and one file creation event within the PowerShell startup profile directory, indicative of potential persistence mechanisms. The use of unusual directory paths further raises suspicion.\"\n}\n```"}
