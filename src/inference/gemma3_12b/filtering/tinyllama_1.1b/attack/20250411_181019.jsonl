The repeated registry modifications by various processes (services.exe, cmd.exe, notepad.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and the loading of `urlmon.dll` and `amsi.dll` suggest potential reconnaissance and\/or malicious activity. The repeated PowerShell process accesses and service creation attempts are strong indicators of compromise.\"\n}\n```"}
