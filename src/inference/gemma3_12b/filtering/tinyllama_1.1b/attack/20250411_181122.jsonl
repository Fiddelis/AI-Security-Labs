The repeated use of 'findstr' and 'select-string' with a 'password' pattern is a strong indicator of credential harvesting.  Furthermore, the creation and deletion of PowerShell startup scripts, coupled with numerous .NET framework DLL image loads and the repeated lifecycle events of the engine, raise concerns about potential malicious activity and persistence mechanisms.
