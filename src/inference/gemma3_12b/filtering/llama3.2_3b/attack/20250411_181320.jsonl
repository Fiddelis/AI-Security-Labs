This suggests potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. The image loading events for PowerShell also indicate DLL loading, which could be related to exploitation. The `whoami` execution, coupled with PowerShell activity, further supports the concern. While there's also user account management and other seemingly benign events, the PowerShell sequence warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
