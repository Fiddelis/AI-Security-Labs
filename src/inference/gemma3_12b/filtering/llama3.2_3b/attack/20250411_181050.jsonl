This pattern is frequently used for obfuscating malicious payloads and bypassing detection.  The repeated use of `certutil` along with other processes like `powershell` and `cmd.exe` further increases suspicion. The presence of `SDXHelper.exe` and processes accessing files, along with the network connections from Chrome and repeated registry modifications also adds to the overall concern, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
