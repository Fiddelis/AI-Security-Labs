This pattern strongly suggests unauthorized user creation and privilege escalation attempts, which are indicative of malicious activity. The presence of OneDrive.exe loading a DLL from system32 and Chrome loading AMSI and Defender DLLs are also suspicious, potentially indicating evasion techniques. Several registry modifications by chrome and powershell add to the concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
