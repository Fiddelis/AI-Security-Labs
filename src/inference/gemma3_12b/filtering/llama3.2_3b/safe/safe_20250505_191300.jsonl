Specifically, there are registry modifications (`reg.exe`) to create and modify an autostart entry for Discord, including a command-line parameter with an executable path, and multiple file creations within the Discord installation directory. The repeated `ProcessAccess` events for Discord, along with network connections, could indicate ongoing interaction with Discord's components.
