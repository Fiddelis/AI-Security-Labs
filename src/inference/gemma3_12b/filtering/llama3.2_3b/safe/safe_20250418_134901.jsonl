{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the events observed and potential implications, categorized by significance and potential risk:\n\n**1. High Significance \/ Potential Risk (Requires Investigation)**\n\n*   **SDXHelper.exe, urlmon.dll, combase.dll:**  The combination of `SDXHelper.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` and `combase.dll` is noteworthy. `urlmon.dll` handles URL protocols, and is often leveraged by malicious software for downloading or launching payloads.  `combase.dll` is a core COM component. The use of `SDXHelper.exe`  (whose purpose is unclear without more context) combined with URL handling is a potential indicator of malicious activity.  **Immediate Action:** Determine the origin and purpose of `SDXHelper.exe`. Identify its processes and network connections.  Consider it suspicious until its legitimacy is confirmed.\n*   **Chrome.exe, Registry Value Set:**  Multiple registry value sets by `chrome.exe` can point to modifications to browser settings, extensions, or configuration. While not always malicious, it can be a symptom of unwanted behavior or a browser hijack. **Action:** Examine the specific registry keys being modified. Research them for known malicious activity. Review installed Chrome extensions.\n\n**2. Moderate Significance (Monitor, Investigate if Anomalous)**\n\n*   **Chrome.exe, Dns Query:** Normal browser activity. However, monitor unusual domain requests or connections to unfamiliar IPs.\n*   **Taskhostw.exe, Taskschd.dll:**  Normal activity related to Windows Task Scheduler. Investigate if tasks are being created or modified unexpectedly.\n*   **Winlogbeat.exe, file creation:** Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper. It's expected to create configuration files. Check for unauthorized changes to this configuration.\n\n**3. Low Significance (Normal System Activity)**\n\n*   **Winlogbeat.exe, winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64, data, .winlogbeat.yml.new**:  Expected behavior for Winlogbeat.  This is part of its configuration process.\n*   **Svchost.exe, registry value set:** `Svchost.exe` is a generic host process for Windows services. Registry modifications are common but should be monitored.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe presence of `SDXHelper.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` is the most concerning indicator.  While other events are mostly benign, the suspicious activity requires immediate attention.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System (if possible):** Prevent the system from accessing the network to limit any potential data exfiltration.\n2.  **Investigate SDXHelper.exe:**\n    *   Determine where it came from.\n    *   Analyze its behavior (processes, network connections, files accessed).\n    *   Check VirusTotal and other online tools to see if it's been flagged as malicious.\n3.  **Review Chrome Extensions:**  Disable or remove any suspicious extensions.\n4.  **Monitor Network Traffic:**  Look for any unusual outbound connections.\n5.  **Scan with Antivirus\/EDR:** Perform a full system scan with an up-to-date antivirus or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.\n6.  **Examine Registry Changes:**  Carefully review the specific registry keys being modified by Chrome.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided logs. A more thorough investigation may be necessary to confirm the presence of malicious activity."}
