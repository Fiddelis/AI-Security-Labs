The scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which is a technique used to evade detection. Subsequent queries of the scheduled task are also observed.  The creation of scheduled tasks run as `SYSTEM` is a significant privilege escalation concern. While there's also activity from `chrome.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`, the scheduled task creation attempts are the primary driver of interest.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
