The presence of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' used in conjunction with these commands, along with file creation events involving winlogbeat and powershell, strongly suggests malicious activity or attempted privilege escalation.  The commands appear to be adding new domain users and adding them to the 'Domain Admins' group, which is a critical escalation path.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
