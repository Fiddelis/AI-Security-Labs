So, first, I should look through each event to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. There's also a whoami.exe process, which is typically used to check user privileges. But on its own, that's not necessarily bad.\n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There are several entries with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' from PowerShell. But the key thing here is the command lines in some of the PowerShell processes. Let me look closer at one of them. The command line includes code that uses System.Windows.Forms to capture the screen and save it as a PNG in the TEMP directory. That's unusual. Why would someone capture the screen? Maybe for taking screenshots, but in a security context, that could be part of an attack, like exfiltrating data or taking screenshots of sensitive information.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various .dll files. Some of these are .NET assemblies, which is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be relevant. However, the main concern here is the screen capture commands. Repeatedly saving screenshots to the TEMP folder could indicate an attempt to gather information from the user's screen, which is a potential security threat.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with the same command line variations, just different filenames for the saved images. That repetition might suggest automated or scripted behavior, which is often seen in malicious activities. Even though some of the events are 'Provider Lifecycle', which might be benign, the combination with the screen capture commands in PowerShell raises suspicion.\n\nI need to check if there's any other malicious activity. The svchost.exe entry with a registry value set isn't immediately suspicious on its own. But combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context like network activity or file modifications, it's hard to say. But the screen capturing is a strong indicator.\n\nSo, considering all this, the repeated PowerShell commands to capture screens and save them could be part of a malicious script trying to exfiltrate data. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.8, as there's a clear suspicious activity that needs checking.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands to capture screenshots using System.Windows.Forms and save them to the TEMP directory, which is suspicious and may indicate screen scraping or data exfiltration.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that are taking screenshots and saving them to the TEMP directory. The command lines are similar, using Add-Type to load System.Windows.Forms, then capturing the screen and saving as a PNG. That's a bit suspicious because taking screenshots might be part of reconnaissance, like mapping out the user interface or looking for sensitive information on the screen. But why multiple times? Maybe the attacker is trying to capture different parts of the screen or just testing.\n\nThen there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up. The fact that it's created and then deleted could be an attempt to avoid leaving evidence. But sometimes legitimate scripts do that too, so not sure yet.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event for PowerShell, which might be related to communication between processes. Not sure if that's malicious yet. Then another screenshot saved as 'objeto_principal.png' and 'elemento_base.png'. The names are in Portuguese, maybe? 'objeto_principal' translates to 'main object' and 'elemento_base' to 'base element'. Not sure if that's significant, but maybe the attacker is using localized names to avoid detection.\n\nOther events include registry value sets and file creations. Some are from legitimate processes like Chrome and Calculator, but the registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms. The remote command executions could be part of a larger attack, but there's not enough info here. The winlogbeat file creation seems normal, maybe part of a log collection tool.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated screenshotting and the temporary file creation\/deletion are red flags. PowerShell is often used in attacks, and screenshotting can be part of data exfiltration. However, without more context like network activity or unusual registry changes, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events does suggest potential malicious activity worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, particularly due to the **repeated use of PowerShell for screenshot capture** and **temporary file manipulation**, which are often associated with reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Here's a breakdown of key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Screenshot Activities (Multiple Instances)**\n- **Command Pattern**:\n  ```powershell\n  Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms; $screen = [System.Windows.Forms.Screen]::PrimaryScreen.Bounds; $bitmap = New-Object System.Drawing.Bitmap($screen.Width, $screen.Height); $graphics = [System.Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bitmap); $graphics.CopyFromScreen($screen.Location, [System.Drawing.Point]::Empty, $screen.Size); $bitmap.Save(\"$env:TEMP\\elemento_base.png\", [System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat]::Png);\n  ```\n  - **Purpose**: Captures screenshots of the screen and saves them to the `%TEMP%` directory with filenames like `elemento_base.png`, `objeto_principal.png`, etc.\n  - **Suspicious Behavior**:\n    - **Repeated execution**: Multiple logs show similar commands, suggesting **persistent or automated screenshot capture**.\n    - **File naming**: Filenames like `elemento_base.png` (Portuguese for \"base element\") may indicate **localized or obfuscated naming** to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary File Creation and Deletion**\n- **File Created**:\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (PowerShell profile file).\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (deleted shortly after creation).\n- **Implication**:\n  - **Cleanup behavior**: The creation and deletion of a PowerShell profile file could indicate **post-exploitation activity** (e.g., configuring persistence or hiding malicious scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple processes** (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, `Calculator.exe`) trigger **\"Registry value set\"** events.\n- **Possible Use Case**:\n  - **Persistence mechanisms**: Registry changes could be used to add startup entries or modify existing keys for **long-term access**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Remote Command Execution**\n- **Events**:\n  - `\"Execute a Remote Command\"` (appears twice).\n  - `\"Executing Pipeline\"` (once).\n- **Concern**:\n  - These events may indicate **remote access** or **command-and-control (C2) communication**, though no network traffic details are provided here.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate**:\n  - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is likely part of **log collection** (e.g., ELK stack).\n  - `chrome.exe` and `Calculator.exe` triggering registry events may be **normal user behavior**.\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - The **repeated PowerShell screenshotting** is highly unusual in most legitimate scenarios and aligns with **reconnaissance or data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Investigate Further**\n- **High-Confidence Indicators**:\n  - Repeated screenshot capture via PowerShell.\n  - Temporary file creation\/deletion.\n  - Unusual registry modifications by PowerShell.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - **Correlate with network logs**: Check for outbound connections to C2 servers.\n  - **Analyze file contents**: Examine the deleted PowerShell script (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) if recoverable.\n  - **Check for persistence**: Investigate registry changes for startup entries or malicious configurations.\n  - **Monitor user activity**: Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or access to sensitive systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Level**\n- **Likely Malicious**: The combination of PowerShell screenshotting, temporary file manipulation, and registry changes strongly suggests **malicious activity** (e.g., reconnaissance, persistence, or exfiltration).\n- **Recommendation**: Isolate the affected system, perform a full forensic analysis, and block suspicious network traffic."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a batch of events, all related to Chrome.exe performing various actions. The main tasks here are Registry value sets, DNS queries, and image loaded events. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity. Chrome.exe is a legitimate process, but it's common for malware to masquerade as legitimate processes. However, looking at the events, most of them are Registry modifications and DNS queries, which can be normal for Chrome, especially if it's updating settings or connecting to servers.\n\nWait, there's an image loaded event where Chrome.exe loaded amsi.dll from the System32 directory. That's actually a legitimate file. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. Another image loaded is MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's also legitimate. So those are not suspicious.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events might be normal if Chrome is modifying its own settings. However, if there's a high volume of such events or if they're modifying sensitive keys, that could be a red flag. But in the given data, there's no specific detail about which registry keys are being modified. The task just says \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" without more context. \n\nDNS queries are also normal for Chrome, but if they're pointing to unusual domains, that could be a problem. However, the user hasn't provided the actual DNS query details, just the rule name. \n\nSince all the events are related to legitimate processes and no specific malicious indicators are present (like unexpected files, unusual network activity, or suspicious registry changes), the batch doesn't seem to be interesting. The confidence is medium because without more context, it's hard to be certain, but based on the given info, there's no clear sign of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate Chrome.exe process activity (registry modifications, DNS queries, and loading of signed Windows Defender DLLs).
