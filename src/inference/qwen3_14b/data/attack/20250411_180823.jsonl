{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's okay. Notepad modifying the registry might be odd, but maybe it's a legitimate action.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is common, but sometimes used in attacks. However, just accessing a process isn't necessarily bad. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is a system file, so that's normal. But then there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line has schtasks creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with system-wide permissions might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there's another schtasks.exe creating a task with \/ru system, which means it's running as the system user. That's a red flag because it's giving the task elevated privileges. Also, multiple svchost.exe processes modifying the registry. Svchost is a host process for Windows services, so if it's changing the registry, that might be normal, but in combination with other events, it could indicate something's wrong.\n\nThen there are file creations in the Tasks directory under System32. Scheduled tasks being created there could be legitimate, but when combined with the schtasks commands that run calc.exe, it might be part of an attempt to maintain access. Also, the presence of multiple schtasks.exe processes creating different tasks with system permissions is concerning.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern of unauthorized access or unexpected behavior. The key points here are the creation of scheduled tasks with system-level permissions, the use of cmd.exe to run calc.exe repeatedly, and the modification of registry values by various processes. While some of these actions can be legitimate, the combination and frequency might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nTherefore, the batch is interesting because it shows multiple suspicious activities that could be part of a malicious attack, even though individual events might not be harmful on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including creation of scheduled tasks with system-level permissions, repeated execution of calc.exe via schtasks, and registry modifications by non-system processes. These patterns may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. Hmm, there are a bunch of events here. The first thing I notice is that several processes are triggering registry value set events. Processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are all setting registry values. But wait, some of these are normal processes. For example, Calculator.exe is a standard Windows app, so maybe that's just normal behavior. However, the fact that so many different processes are modifying the registry could be a red flag, especially if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process appearing multiple times. It's doing a lot of registry value sets, which is unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much. Also, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender components. Loading them might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe someone is installing it. But the user is fiddelis, and the path is in their Downloads folder. That might be part of a legitimate setup, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger activity.\n\nAnother point is the whoami.exe execution. That's a standard command to check user identity, but if it's being run in a context where it's not expected, maybe as part of privilege escalation, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, by itself, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nThere's also a file created event for unidade_ativo.txt. The name doesn't ring any bells, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and file creations might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or install software.\n\nBut wait, the logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like downloading executables, connecting to suspicious IPs, or using PowerShell for malicious scripts. The events are mostly about registry changes and process accesses. The presence of PowerShell is common, but if it's being used for something like remote access or data exfiltration, that would be more concerning. However, the logs here don't show that.\n\nSo, the key here is the volume of registry modifications by chrome.exe and other processes. While some of these could be benign, the sheer number of events might indicate a larger issue. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities, it's a bit hard to be certain. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some unusual patterns, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent definitively.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events by chrome.exe and powershell.exe, combined with file creation in user Downloads directory, suggest potential system tampering or data collection activity. The high frequency of registry writes by non-system processes warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
