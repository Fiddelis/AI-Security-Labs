So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and processes created. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. Then there's 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes creating a service with a path pointing to a non-existing script: 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The fact that the scripts are non-existing might be a red flag, indicating that the attacker is trying to execute a script that doesn't exist, which could be a sign of a failed attempt or a setup for a future attack.\n\nLooking at the 'sc.exe' process, it's used to create a service, which is a common technique for persistence. The command line arguments show the creation of a service with a binPath that includes starting a PowerShell script. Even though the script paths don't exist now, this could be part of an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nThere are several 'Registry value set' events, which could be normal, but combined with the service creation and PowerShell activity, might indicate configuration changes for malicious purposes. Also, the 'Image loaded' events for 'urlmon.dll' might be normal, but if this is part of a larger pattern of unexpected image loads, it could be suspicious.\n\nThe presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory might be legitimate if it's part of a log collection process, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the other events seem more suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating services with non-existent scripts, multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, and registry changes suggests potential malicious behavior. Even though some events might be normal, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated PowerShell access, service creation attempts with non-existent scripts (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'), and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants to know if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe activities. That's common in some attacks, but not always malicious. Then I see scvhost.exe and chrome.exe loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, those are legitimate DLLs used by Windows Defender. But why are they being loaded by chrome.exe? That might be normal if Chrome is interacting with Defender, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code into these DLLs. However, the paths here look standard.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'sc' commands in some entries. Wait, no, looking again, I see entries with 'sc' in the process name? No, maybe I'm confused. Wait, the first entries have processes like 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set'. Then there's a line where 'chrome.exe' loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But if it's unexpected, maybe it's part of an attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' entries, there's a lot of 'Registry value set' events. That could be part of normal operations, but if combined with other suspicious activities, like creating files or loading unexpected DLLs, it might be more concerning.\n\nWait, there's an entry where 'Calculator.exe' loads urlmon.dll. That's a standard DLL, but Calculator.exe is a normal application. However, the fact that it's loading urlmon.dll might not be suspicious on its own. But if there are multiple instances of image loads, maybe that's worth checking.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe might indicate some configuration changes. But again, without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell.\n\nHmm, there's also a 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' with registry events. These are part of the Windows UI, so their activity might be normal. However, if they're modifying registry values in a way that's not typical, that could be an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: there are multiple registry modifications, some image loads of legitimate DLLs, and a mix of normal and potentially suspicious processes. However, none of the events seem to be overtly malicious. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the system in question. Since this is just a log dump without context, it's hard to say definitively. But the presence of multiple registry changes and image loads might warrant further investigation to ensure that no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of normal processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes with Unusual Behavior:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`:**  \n     These DLLs are part of Windows Defender (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` is a component of Microsoft Defender Antivirus). While legitimate, their loading by `chrome.exe` could indicate:\n     - **Malicious use of DLL hijacking** (e.g., if the DLLs are tampered with).\n     - **Legitimate interaction** (e.g., Chrome integrating with Defender for security features).  \n     **Action:** Verify the integrity of the loaded DLLs (e.g., check digital signatures, hash values).\n\n   - **`Calculator.exe` and `svchost.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`:**  \n     `urlmon.dll` is a standard Windows component for URL handling. However, its loading by non-browser processes (e.g., `Calculator.exe`) could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **malware injection**.  \n     **Action:** Correlate with process memory dumps or behavioral analysis to confirm legitimacy.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent `Registry value set` events** by `chrome.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe`:  \n     Registry changes are common but can be exploited by malware to persist or modify system behavior.  \n     **Action:** Investigate specific registry keys modified (e.g., `HKCU`, `HKLM` paths) for unauthorized changes.\n\n3. **PowerShell and CMD Activity:**\n   - **`powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with `Process accessed` and `Registry value set` events:**  \n     These are often used in attacks for **scripting** or **registry manipulation**. While not inherently malicious, their frequency and context (e.g., lack of clear purpose) merit scrutiny.  \n     **Action:** Check for PowerShell command history, script execution, or suspicious registry keys.\n\n4. **File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`:**  \n   - The creation of a file in the `Downloads` directory (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-...`) is expected for log shippers like Winlogbeat. However, **unexpected file creation** or **non-standard paths** could indicate tampering.  \n     **Action:** Confirm the file's origin and integrity (e.g., check if it's part of a legitimate Winlogbeat installation).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual DLL loading** by non-browser processes (e.g., `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`).\n- **Frequent registry modifications** without clear justification (e.g., by `chrome.exe` or `svchost.exe`).\n- **Lack of context** for PowerShell\/CMD activity (e.g., no visible script execution or user interaction).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps:**\n1. **Correlate with Endpoint Logs:**\n   - Check for **process memory dumps**, **network connections**, or **file modifications** around the time of these events.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to analyze suspicious processes.\n\n2. **Verify DLL Integrity:**\n   - Use **Windows Defender** or **SIEM tools** to check the hash and digital signature of `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, and `urlmon.dll`.\n\n3. **Review User Behavior:**\n   - Determine if the user executing these processes has **elevated privileges** or **unusual access patterns**.\n\n4. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the system with **antivirus software** or **YARA rules** targeting known malicious behavior (e.g., DLL hijacking, registry persistence).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile many events are consistent with normal system behavior, the **unusual DLL loading** and **frequent registry changes** are red flags. **Further investigation** is required to rule out malicious activity. If these events occur on a **secured system**, consider isolating the host for deeper analysis."}
