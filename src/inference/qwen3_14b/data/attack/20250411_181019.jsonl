{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is common, but when it's used multiple times, especially with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Then there's the 'sc.exe' process creating a service called 'win32times' with a command line that includes starting a script from a non-existent path: 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The fact that the scripts don't exist might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not there, which could be part of a larger attack, like trying to inject code or exploit a vulnerability.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, so that's another point to note. The 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' processes are legitimate, but if they're being used in conjunction with suspicious registry changes, that could be a sign of something bad.\n\nAnother thing is the 'Image loaded' events pointing to 'urlmon.dll'. While that's a legitimate DLL, if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of a malicious payload. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious code here, just the loading of a standard DLL.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory is normal, but the presence of a new YAML file might be part of configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the creation of a service with non-existent scripts and multiple registry changes could be part of an attack. The repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe, along with the service creation, seems suspicious. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'sc.exe' creating a service with a non-existent script path (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), 2) repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe process accesses, 3) registry modification attempts by services.exe\/svchost.exe, and 4) unusual image load events for urlmon.dll. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity attempting to establish persistence or execute scripts.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first eight events are all about 'chrome.exe' performing a 'Registry value set' task under the RegistryEvent rule. That's a lot of registry modifications by Chrome. Normally, Chrome might modify the registry for its own operations, like updates or settings, but doing it repeatedly could be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen, the ninth and tenth events show 'chrome.exe' loading images (files) from specific paths: amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files. Loading these DLLs might be normal if Chrome is interacting with Windows Defender, but it's worth noting. However, if these were from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But here, the paths look standard.\n\nThe eleventh event is about 'powershell.exe' being accessed by a process, but the file path is None. Wait, the 'Process accessed' event usually indicates that a process has been accessed, which could be a sign of something like process injection or monitoring. However, without more context, like which process accessed PowerShell or what the action was, it's hard to tell. The fact that PowerShell is involved is notable because it's often used in attacks for executing commands.\n\nNow, considering all together: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which could be normal, but combined with PowerShell being accessed. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or other suspicious behaviors. The Chrome events might be part of normal operations, and the PowerShell event might be a legitimate process access. Without more context or anomalies, this might not be enough to classify as interesting. But wait, the repeated registry modifications by Chrome could be a sign of something trying to change settings or inject code. However, Chrome is a common application, and it's possible that these are just normal operations. The justification needs to be concise. Maybe the combination of registry changes and PowerShell access is not enough to be suspicious. Alternatively, the fact that all the Chrome events are the same might be a sign of a script or process doing repetitive tasks, but again, not necessarily malicious. I think the answer here is that it's not interesting because there's no clear malicious activity, just normal process behavior. But I need to make sure. The user might be expecting that the repeated registry changes are suspicious, but I need to check if that's a common occurrence. Maybe Chrome updates or extensions modify the registry frequently. Without more data, it's hard to say, but the events provided don't have any clear indicators of compromise. So the classification is NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal Chrome.exe registry modifications and legitimate Windows Defender DLL loads. No clear malicious activity or anomalies detected in the batch.\"\n}"}
