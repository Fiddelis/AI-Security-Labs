{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. The task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the logs, there are several entries related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not a red flag. But then there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nOne of the entries has a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub URL. That's a common technique for downloading scripts or payloads. The URLs are from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a legitimate site, but the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of normal user activity. \n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because it's a security-related DLL, but I'm not sure if that's a problem here. \n\nThere's a File Created and then immediately deleted event. The file is a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to hide the presence of the script, which is a common tactic in malware. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that it's being used repeatedly in this way, especially with different repositories and filenames, might indicate that someone is trying to execute remote scripts. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these might be benign. For example, a user might be using PowerShell for legitimate scripting tasks. But the combination of downloading files, creating temporary scripts, and the number of events might suggest something more. \n\nThe presence of multiple Image Load events for .NET components doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity, but when combined with the file operations and network activity, it could be a sign of something suspicious. Also, the fact that the same command pattern is used multiple times (using WebClient to download from GitHub) might be a red flag. \n\nI should also check if there's any indication of privilege escalation or unusual processes. But from the logs provided, there's no mention of that. However, the repeated actions by PowerShell might be enough to flag this as interesting. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. The confidence is probably around 0.7 or 0.8 because while some activities are normal, the combination of multiple downloads, temporary files, and the use of PowerShell in this manner is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances are downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient, creating and deleting temporary scripts, and loading .NET DLLs. While not definitively malicious, the pattern of remote script execution and ephemeral file operations raises suspicion of potential adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is common, but the command lines here are using WebClient.DownloadFile from GitHub. The URLs are pointing to LICENSE.txt files from different repositories. Hmm, that might be normal, but sometimes attackers use similar techniques to download malicious payloads. However, the files being downloaded here are LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign. But I should check if there's any pattern here.\n\nWait, there are multiple events where PowerShell is downloading files from GitHub. The paths where they're saving the files are in the TEMP directory or user downloads. That's a red flag because attackers often use temporary directories to execute malicious code. However, the files are named things like estrutura_temporario.txt, which might be just normal files. But combining that with the fact that there are multiple such downloads could indicate something.\n\nAlso, there are several File created events. One of them is in the Downloads folder, which is normal, but another is in the PowerShell StartupProfileData. That might be related to configuration changes. Then there's a winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is a log shipper. Maybe that's part of a legitimate setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are multiple Registry value set events from chrome.exe and others. Chrome modifying its own registry might be normal, but if it's changing settings that aren't typical, that could be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for the Process accessed events.\n\nAnother thing is the Dns query event. If there are a lot of DNS queries to suspicious domains, that's a red flag. But in this case, the event just mentions a Dns query, no specific domain. So not enough info there.\n\nThe presence of MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection is normal since that's part of Windows Defender. So that's likely benign.\n\nNow, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, some file creations in unusual directories, and multiple registry changes. While some of these could be benign, the repeated use of PowerShell for downloading files, especially from external sources, could indicate a potential security incident. However, without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files or more context on the registry changes, it's a bit hard to be certain. But given that there are multiple suspicious activities clustered together, this might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Multiple `WebClient.DownloadFile` operations** from GitHub URLs (e.g., `LICENSE.txt` files). While GitHub is legitimate, downloading files from external repositories via PowerShell can be **suspicious** if:\n     - The files are not expected (e.g., unexpected naming, size, or content).\n     - The URLs point to non-standard repositories (not the official GitHub pages).\n     - The downloads occur in **temporary directories** (e.g., `TEMP` or `Downloads`), which are common for malicious payloads.\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   - **Unusual file paths**: \n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt` and `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` (a `.yml.new` file for a log shipper, which may indicate configuration changes).\n     - **PowerShell StartupProfileData** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) could suggest tampering with PowerShell profiles or log configuration.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent `Registry value set` events** from processes like `chrome.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `RuntimeBroker.exe`. While registry changes are normal, **unusual or frequent modifications** (especially from non-system processes) may indicate **malware persistence** or **configuration tampering**.\n\n4. **Network Activity:**\n   - A **`Dns query` event** without a specific domain listed. If the query resolves to a suspicious or unknown domain, this could indicate **command-and-control (C2) communication**.\n\n5. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` (Windows Defender) and `winlogbeat.exe` (log shipper) are **legitimate** if part of a monitored environment. However, **unexpected behavior** (e.g., file creation in unusual locations) warrants scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: \n  - The activity is **not definitively malicious**, but the **combination of PowerShell downloads, file creation in non-standard paths, and registry modifications** raises **red flags**.\n  - **Context is critical**: \n    - If the user is **expecting** these downloads (e.g., during software deployment), the risk is low.\n    - If the system is **unmonitored** or the user is **unaware** of these activities, further investigation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the downloaded files**:\n   - Check the **content** of `estrutura_temporario.txt`, `entrada_base.txt`, and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` files.\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **YARA rules** to scan for malicious signatures.\n\n2. **Monitor registry changes**:\n   - Use **SIEM tools** (e.g., Splunk, ELK) to correlate registry modifications with other events (e.g., process creation, network activity).\n\n3. **Check DNS queries**:\n   - Investigate the **domain** associated with the `Dns query` event to determine if it resolves to a **malicious IP** or **C2 server**.\n\n4. **Audit PowerShell usage**:\n   - Enable **PowerShell logging** and monitor for **unauthorized script execution** or **downloaded payloads**.\n\n5. **Verify winlogbeat configuration**:\n   - Ensure `.yml.new` files are part of a **legitimate update** and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries **require further analysis** to determine if they represent **normal activity** or **potential compromise**. The **repeated PowerShell downloads** and **unusual file creation** are **suspicious enough to warrant investigation**. If the system is part of a **critical infrastructure** or **untrusted environment**, immediate action is advised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there's an event with calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe there's something odd here. Then there are several svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. Svchost is normal, but multiple registry changes could be a red flag. \n\nWait, there's a Calculator.exe entry, which is similar to calc.exe. Both are loading urlmon.dll. That might be normal, but maybe there's a pattern. Then powershell.exe appears multiple times with process access and registry events. PowerShell is often used in attacks, so that's suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task could be part of cleaning up after an attack. Another cmd.exe instance is deleting a registry key under Run, which might be removing persistence mechanisms. \n\nThen there's reg.exe deleting another registry key. Multiple deletions in the Run key could indicate an attacker trying to remove traces. The presence of whoami.exe is normal, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe for privilege checking. \n\nThe combination of registry modifications, process creations involving PowerShell and cmd, and attempts to delete scheduled tasks and registry entries suggests someone is trying to manipulate the system. The repeated registry changes and use of command-line tools for deletion might indicate an attacker trying to persist or cover their tracks. \n\nHowever, some of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate scripts. But the frequency and the specific actions like deleting tasks and registry keys, along with the use of PowerShell, which is common in attacks, make this look suspicious. I think this is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - **`calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`**: While `urlmon.dll` is a legitimate system component, its invocation by `calc.exe` (a standard calculator) may indicate process injection or hijacking.\n   - **`powershell.exe` repeated usage with \"Process accessed\" events**: PowerShell is frequently abused in attacks for executing malicious scripts. Frequent access events could signal lateral movement or command execution.\n\n2. **Registry Manipulation:**\n   - **Multiple `REG DELETE` commands** targeting the `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` key (e.g., deleting \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\"). This suggests an attempt to **remove persistence mechanisms** (e.g., startup entries) to evade detection.\n   - **`svchost.exe` and `cmd.exe` triggering \"Registry object added\/deleted\" events**: Frequent registry modifications could indicate **tampering with system configurations** or attempts to disable security tools.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletion:**\n   - **`cmd.exe` executing `REG DELETE` for a scheduled task named \"spawn\"**: Deleting scheduled tasks may be part of **cleaning up post-exploitation activities** or preventing automated defenses.\n\n4. **Command-Line Tool Usage:**\n   - **`reg.exe` and `cmd.exe` used for registry deletions**: These tools are often leveraged in attacks for direct system manipulation, especially when combined with registry edits.\n\n### **Possible Attack Scenario:**\n- An attacker may have **compromised the system**, used PowerShell\/cmd for lateral movement, and **erased persistence artifacts** (e.g., startup entries, scheduled tasks) to avoid detection. The deletion of registry keys under `Run` suggests the attacker was trying to remove **backdoors or malware** configured to launch automatically.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for **unauthorized user logins**, unusual network traffic, or file modifications around the same time.\n   - Investigate the origin of the `spawn` task (e.g., was it created by a legitimate process?).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Cmdlets:**\n   - Review the exact commands executed by `powershell.exe` (e.g., use of `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`, or other suspicious cmdlets).\n\n3. **Check for Persistence Artifacts:**\n   - Verify if the deleted registry keys (`modulo_temporario`, `pacote_auxiliar`) were part of legitimate software or if they were malicious.\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement:**\n   - Look for **unusual authentication events** or remote access attempts that could indicate the attacker is moving laterally within the network.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events suggest **active mitigation efforts by an attacker** (e.g., deleting persistence mechanisms) combined with **system manipulation** via PowerShell and command-line tools. This is highly suspicious and merits immediate investigation to determine if the system was compromised and to prevent further lateral movement."}

There are several entries with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks. But what stands out are the 'Image loaded' events. Let me check those. \n\nLooking at the files loaded, there's mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script file in Temp might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to execute malicious scripts. However, the fact that it's immediately deleted could be a red flag. \n\nAlso, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That might be part of normal monitoring, but if there's no other context, it's not suspicious. \n\nAnother thing is the multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be part of PowerShell's normal operations, but if they're excessive, it could indicate something. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious commands or unexpected network activity. \n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The presence of a temporary script file being created and deleted, along with multiple PowerShell events, might indicate some automated script execution. However, without more context like the script's content or unusual network calls, it's hard to say for sure. \n\nBut considering that PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities, and the Temp file creation\/deletion is a common technique, this might be worth investigating. However, since the script is deleted, it's possible it's a false positive or part of a legitimate process. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough suspicious activities to warrant further investigation.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's whoami.exe and powershell.exe being created or accessed. Whoami is a standard command, so that's normal. Powershell is commonly used, but the task here is ProcessAccess and Registry changes. Then there's cmd.exe being used with some command line arguments. But nothing too suspicious yet.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. That's a lot of activity. Then, there's a command line with \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems odd. The curly braces might be part of a script or command, but maybe it's just a placeholder. However, repeated entries of the same command might indicate something automated or malicious.\n\nThen, there are image loads of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender is interesting. Maybe that's part of a legitimate process, but I need to check if there's anything unusual about it.\n\nAnother point is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be related to PowerShell script execution policies. If this is part of a test, it's normal, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something. However, the file is created and then deleted, which might be a red flag if it's part of a transient malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with the same command line might indicate a loop or automated process. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The combination of multiple registry changes, process accesses, and file operations could be part of a legitimate script or a more complex attack.\n\nConsidering all these points, the activity seems to involve PowerShell and registry changes, which are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. The file creation and deletion in Temp might be suspicious, but without more evidence like unusual commands or network activity, it's hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The classification should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" based on whether there's suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them involve processes like powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and some others. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Pipe Created, Process accessed, and Image loaded. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries where powershell.exe is involved in actions like creating files, accessing processes, and modifying the registry. For example, one entry shows a file created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". That path is in the user's AppData, which might be normal, but creating files there could be part of legitimate PowerShell usage, like saving scripts or profiles.\n\nAnother thing is the command lines. One entry has \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". Removing a file from the temp directory might be normal, but the presence of this command could indicate someone trying to clean up after an action. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe Image loaded events point to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard components, so loading them is normal. However, if there were unexpected DLLs loaded from unusual paths, that would be a red flag. Here, the paths are standard, so that's probably okay.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity. That's not suspicious on its own.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are multiple entries for chrome.exe modifying the registry. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's part of updates or extensions. However, repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else, like a browser hijacker or malware trying to persist.\n\nHowever, the logs don't show any obvious signs of malware, like unusual network activity, unexpected processes, or attempts to execute malicious code. The PowerShell commands are basic and don't include anything like downloading payloads or executing scripts from the internet. The file removal command is just deleting a zip file, which could be part of a legitimate process.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses might be part of normal operations, especially if the user is running scripts or applications that interact with the registry. Without more context or additional suspicious indicators (like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or unusual file modifications), it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The fact that there are several PowerShell events, including process creation and registry changes, might be more indicative. However, in many environments, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, so it's not inherently suspicious. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the logs don't have enough evidence of malicious activity. The actions described are within normal operational ranges, even if a bit frequent. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there's a specific pattern I'm missing. But I should check again.\n\nWait, the entry with the file path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\" – maybe that's a startup script being created. If that's part of a legitimate setup, it's okay. But if it's being created by an unauthorized process, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show the origin of that file creation. \n\nAlso, the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a red flag. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. Maybe that's a sign of a browser extension or a hijacker. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some suspicious elements, they might not be enough to classify the logs as interesting. The answer might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities described are within normal ranges, even if a bit frequent. However, if the user is in a high-security environment, even these could be flagged. But based on standard analysis, it's probably not suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily document routine system activities involving PowerShell and Chrome, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:  \n   - Commands like `Remove-Item` and file creation are common in legitimate scripting scenarios. The paths involved (e.g., `%TEMP%`, AppData) are standard for temporary or user-specific operations.  \n   - Multiple `ImageLoad` events reference standard .NET framework DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`), which are expected during PowerShell execution.  \n\n2. **Chrome Registry Modifications**:  \n   - Frequent registry changes by Chrome may indicate updates, extensions, or user configuration adjustments. While unusual for Chrome, this alone is not inherently suspicious without additional context (e.g., unexpected registry keys, unauthorized persistence mechanisms).  \n\n3. **Lack of Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - No evidence of network communication, unauthorized access, or execution of payloads.  \n   - The `whoami.exe` process is legitimate and unrelated to malware.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The logs reflect normal system operations and administrative tasks. While the volume of PowerShell and registry activity might warrant further investigation in a security-sensitive context, there are no definitive signs of malicious behavior.  \n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate security software. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp can be a red flag, especially if they're being created and then deleted. The next entry shows that same file being deleted. That pattern of creating and deleting might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields, all targeting .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests the attacker wants to avoid errors if the files don't exist, which is common in scripts trying to clean up after themselves. This could be part of a larger operation where files are temporarily created and then removed to avoid detection.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell to delete files, combined with the creation of temporary files, might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts and then remove evidence. Also, the fact that the same files are being deleted multiple times across different events could mean that the script is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of a persistent mechanism or to ensure all traces are gone.\n\nThere are also entries about chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate files related to antivirus and security features. However, the presence of these might be normal, so maybe not suspicious unless there's something else. But the main focus here is on the PowerShell activities.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's internal processes. However, the combination with the file deletions and creations still stands out.\n\nI should also check if there's any unusual registry activity, but the logs mention registry events for chrome.exe and conhost.exe, which might be normal. The PowerShell entries with Registry value set could be part of configuration changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the main suspicious part is the file operations.\n\nPutting it all together, the pattern of creating and deleting temporary PowerShell scripts in the Temp directory, along with multiple Remove-Item commands, suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence here would be moderate because while these actions can be part of legitimate processes (like temporary script execution), the frequency and the specific commands used (especially with -ErrorAction Ignore) are more indicative of something suspicious. However, without more context like unusual network activity or unexpected processes, it's not a high-confidence alert, but it's definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, primarily due to the **pattern of temporary file creation and deletion** involving PowerShell scripts in the user's Temp directory.

This pattern is commonly used in **malicious scripts** to avoid errors if files are missing, potentially indicating **evidence-erasure behavior**.\n\n3. **PowerShell Process Access and Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe` could indicate **attempts to modify system behavior** or escalate privileges, though further context is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Context:**\n- **Legitimate Activity**: \n  - PowerShell is a common tool for scripting, and temporary files in the Temp directory are normal in some scenarios (e.g., software installations, user profiles).\n  - The loading of `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` by `chrome.exe` is legitimate (related to Windows Defender and antivirus features).\n\n- **Suspicious Context**:\n  - The **repeated creation and deletion of scripts** in the Temp directory, combined with `-ErrorAction Ignore`, is **unusual** and raises concerns about **malicious cleanup**.\n  - The lack of clear purpose for the deleted files (e.g., no associated process or user activity) adds to the suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n- **Investigate the Temp Directory**: Check for residual files or logs that might have been deleted, and analyze the contents of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` if recoverable.\n- **Monitor PowerShell Scripting**: Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** to track script execution and command-line arguments.\n- **Correlate with Network Activity**: Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts that might accompany these file operations.\n- **Check User Context**: Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or unusual access rights that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile the activity is not definitively malicious, the **pattern of temporary file creation and deletion** with PowerShell, coupled with the use of `-ErrorAction Ignore`, is **suspicious enough to warrant investigation**. This could indicate **script-based attacks**, **malware cleanup**, or **attempted persistence**. Further analysis of system logs, network traffic, and user behavior is recommended. \n\n**Confidence Level**: **Moderate** (4\/10) – The behavior is not conclusive but raises red flags."}

However, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender could be legitimate, but sometimes attackers might use similar names for malicious purposes. Hmm, but I need to check more.\n\nNext, there are multiple file creations and deletions in the TEMP directory. For example, files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 are created and then deleted. That could be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the script is trying to avoid errors if the file doesn't exist, which is common in cleanup scripts but could also be used to hide activity.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a normal command to check user privileges. But when combined with other PowerShell activities, it might be part of privilege escalation attempts. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the sequence: multiple PowerShell processes creating and deleting files in TEMP, loading various DLLs, and accessing the registry. The repetition of Remove-Item commands on different files in TEMP might indicate an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the presence of ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs could be part of a script that's using .NET to perform actions, which is normal but can also be abused.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably not malicious. But the user might be concerned if there's any unusual activity with it, but in this case, it's just creating a configuration file.\n\nAnother point is the use of registry value sets. Changing registry keys can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. But without seeing the specific keys changed, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that PowerShell is accessing the registry multiple times could be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious activities are the repeated file deletions in TEMP, the loading of various DLLs, and the use of PowerShell for these operations. While some of these actions are normal, the combination and frequency might indicate an attempt to perform malicious activities and then clean up. The presence of whoami.exe could be checking user context before proceeding with more actions.\n\nBut I should also consider that some of these could be false positives. For example, scripts that are part of legitimate software might perform similar actions. However, the pattern here seems more aligned with what you'd see in a malware's behavior—cleaning up after itself, using PowerShell for execution, and interacting with the registry.\n\nSo, based on these observations, I think this batch of events is worth investigating further. The combination of PowerShell activities, file deletions, and registry changes suggests potential malicious behavior that should be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns that warrant further investigation, as they may indicate **malicious activity** or **attempts to obfuscate actions**. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity**\n- **File Deletion in Temp Directories**:  \n  Multiple `Remove-Item` commands target files in the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `pacote_ativo.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`). While temporary file cleanup is normal, the use of `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests **deliberate suppression of errors**, which is common in scripts designed to **avoid detection** or **remove evidence**.\n\n- **File Creation and Deletion Cycles**:  \n  PowerShell creates files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1` and immediately deletes them. This could indicate **script execution followed by cleanup**, which is often seen in **malware** or **post-exploitation activities**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual DLL Loading**\n- **Loading of Windows Defender DLLs**:  \n  PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (part of Windows Defender). While legitimate, this could be **exploited by malware** to **mask its presence** (e.g., mimicking defender processes) or **abuse defender APIs** for malicious purposes.\n\n- **.NET Framework DLLs**:  \n  Loading `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `System.Windows.Forms`) is normal for scripts, but combined with other suspicious actions, it may indicate **code execution via .NET**, which is a common technique in **malware**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple `Registry value set` Events**:  \n  PowerShell and `conhost.exe` modify registry keys. While registry changes are common, the **frequency** and **lack of context** (e.g., specific keys altered) raise concerns about **persistence mechanisms** or **tampering with system behavior**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Privilege Escalation**\n- **`whoami.exe` Execution**:  \n  The `whoami.exe` process checks the current user's identity. If paired with PowerShell activities, this could indicate **privilege escalation attempts** (e.g., checking if the user has admin rights before proceeding with further actions).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Winlogbeat Activity**:  \n  The `winlogbeat.exe` process creating a `.yml.new` file is **legitimate** (part of configuration updates). However, its presence in this batch may be a **red herring** or **coincidental**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Investigate Further**\nWhile some activities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `.NET` DLLs) are benign, the **combination of file deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and PowerShell-based cleanup** strongly suggests **malicious intent**. Key indicators include:\n- **Evidence of cleanup** (file creation\/deletion).\n- **Unusual registry interactions**.\n- **Potential abuse of PowerShell for execution**.\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n- Correlate these events with **network traffic** (e.g., unusual outbound connections).\n- Check for **unauthorized registry changes** or **hidden processes**.\n- Analyze **PowerShell scripts** (if available) for obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- Monitor for **privilege escalation attempts** or **data exfiltration**.\n\nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and should be prioritized for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but if it's happening a lot, maybe that's normal. But then there's 'RuntimeBroker.exe' doing the same. RuntimeBroker is usually associated with UAC (User Account Control) in Windows, so maybe that's part of normal operations. But I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for 'powershell.exe' with 'Process accessed' events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. However, just accessing the process might not be enough to flag it as malicious. But combined with other events, maybe?\n\nThere are also several instances of 'whoami.exe' being created. Whoami is a standard command to get user information, so that's usually benign. But if it's being executed repeatedly, maybe in conjunction with other commands, that could be a sign of something. However, in these logs, there's no indication of other commands or suspicious parameters.\n\nThen, there's an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the filename is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during setup. That might be okay.\n\nAnother entry is 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red flag if it's related to malicious activity. However, without more context, like the content of the file or other related events, it's hard to say. But the fact that PowerShell is creating a file could be part of normal operations, like generating logs or scripts.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a lot of activity from PowerShell and Chrome, but nothing that immediately stands out as malicious. The repeated registry changes by Chrome and RuntimeBroker might be normal, especially if the system is under heavy use. The whoami.exe calls are standard. The file creation by PowerShell might be innocuous, but the filename could be suspicious if it's related to known malicious payloads. However, without more data, like network connections, unusual command-line arguments, or other system calls, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut wait, the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. The presence of multiple PowerShell events accessing processes and creating files, combined with the registry changes, might indicate some level of activity that's worth investigating. However, since none of the events show clear signs of malicious behavior (like unusual command lines, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation), it might not be enough to classify as interesting. On the other hand, the combination of these events could be part of a larger attack, but without more evidence, it's uncertain.\n\nHmm, the confidence level here is tricky. If I lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING,\" it's because the events don't show clear indicators of compromise. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell activities and file creations could be a low-confidence indicator. But since the justification needs to be concise, maybe the best approach is to say that while there's some activity, it's not clearly malicious. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process accesses and file creations, along with repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, suggest potential malicious activity or system compromise. The presence of 'whoami.exe' executions and a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' (which may indicate suspicious behavior) adds to the concern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
