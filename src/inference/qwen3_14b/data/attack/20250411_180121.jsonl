{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe involved. Let me check those entries.\n\nOne of the powershell.exe events has a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting text files like LICENSE.txt. But wait, the command line is using DownloadFile, which is a method that can be abused for downloading malicious payloads. However, the files being downloaded here are LICENSE.txt from GitHub repositories. That's a bit odd because GitHub's raw URLs are usually safe, but maybe the repositories are malicious? Hmm.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading different LICENSE.txt files from various GitHub repos. Each time, the destination is the TEMP directory. But the files are named things like modulo_padrao.txt, entrada_comum.txt, etc. Those names don't seem to be standard, but they could be just the names of the files being downloaded. However, the fact that there are multiple downloads from different GitHub repos might be a red flag. Are these legitimate? Maybe the user is just downloading license files, but the repetition and the use of PowerShell for this could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are events about images loaded, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. The creation and deletion might be part of a script execution, but why would it be deleted right after? Maybe the script was run and then removed to avoid detection. That's a possible indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell's WebClient to download files. While not inherently malicious, it's often used in attacks to download payloads. The fact that there are multiple such downloads from different URLs might indicate that the system is being used to fetch various files, possibly for a larger attack. Also, the presence of Registry value set events and ProcessCreate events could be part of a larger attack chain, like modifying registry settings or creating processes.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if these are just normal activities. For example, users sometimes use PowerShell to download files from the internet. But the combination of multiple downloads, the use of temporary files, and the deletion of those files might be more suspicious. Also, the repetition of similar command lines with different URLs could indicate a pattern that's not typical for regular user activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes both normal activities (like Chrome's network connections) and potentially suspicious activities (PowerShell downloading multiple files from GitHub, creating and deleting temp files). The key here is whether these actions are part of a legitimate process or if they indicate an attack. Since the downloaded files are from GitHub, which is a common source for code, but the use of PowerShell in this way and the multiple instances could be a sign of something malicious. Therefore, this batch might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes both normal and potentially suspicious activities, warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activities:**\n- **Chrome.exe** performing DNS queries and network connections is typical for a web browser.\n- **.NET Framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) being loaded are legitimate system components.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activities:**\n1. **PowerShell Downloads from GitHub:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` using `System.Net.WebClient.DownloadFile` to fetch **`LICENSE.txt`** files from **GitHub raw URLs** (e.g., `raw.githubusercontent.com`). \n   - While GitHub is a legitimate source, the **repetition of such downloads** and the use of `WebClient` (a technique often abused in attacks) raise concerns. The filenames (e.g., `modulo_padrao.txt`, `tarefa_geral.txt`) are non-standard and could indicate arbitrary file downloads.\n\n2. **Temp File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1`) is **created and immediately deleted** in the `TEMP` directory. This pattern is common in **malicious scripts** to avoid detection or persistence.\n\n3. **Command-Line Patterns:**\n   - The use of `& {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(...)` in the command line is a **classic PowerShell technique** for downloading payloads. The URLs, while pointing to GitHub, could be **malicious repositories** (e.g., `modulo_temporario`, `estrutura_temporario`).\n\n4. **Registry and Process Modifications:**\n   - Events like **Registry value changes** and **Provider Lifecycle** tasks (e.g., `Provider Lifecycle` logs) may indicate **post-exploitation activity** or attempts to modify system behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch contains **mixed activity**. While some events (e.g., Chrome traffic) are benign, the **repeated PowerShell downloads**, **temp file tampering**, and **non-standard GitHub repository names** suggest **potential malicious intent**. Further investigation is warranted, including:\n- Verifying the **integrity** of downloaded files.\n- Checking for **unauthorized registry changes**.\n- Analyzing **user context** (e.g., admin privileges, user behavior).\n- Correlating with **external threat intelligence** (e.g., GitHub repository analysis).\n\n**Recommendation:** Flag for deeper analysis to rule out **malicious script execution**, **data exfiltration**, or **initial compromise** via PowerShell."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub raw URL. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/objeto_padrao\/registro_comum\/master\/LICENSE.txt\" and saves it to a temporary file. Wait, GitHub's raw URLs are often used for static files like license texts, which are usually benign. But then there's another event with a similar command from \"elemento_principal\/pacote_geral\" and another from \"unidade_logico\/modulo_comum\". These all seem to be downloading LICENSE.txt files. \n\nBut wait, the paths where they're saving the files are in the TEMP directory, which is common for temporary files. However, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub might be normal if the user is, say, cloning repositories or fetching license information. However, I should check if the URLs are actually pointing to malicious content. But the URLs here are from GitHub, which is a legitimate source. However, the user might be using these as a cover for downloading something else. But the filenames are all LICENSE.txt, which are standard. \n\nThen there's a file created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt\" and another at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt\". These are just regular download paths, so maybe the user is downloading files for legitimate reasons. However, the fact that there are multiple PowerShell downloads might be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. Chrome modifying registry values could be normal, but if it's doing it repeatedly, maybe it's part of some configuration or malware. However, the same event is repeated several times, which might indicate a benign process that's just updating settings. \n\nAnother thing to note is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably okay. The Network connection detected event for MpDefenderCoreService.exe is also likely legitimate, as that's part of Windows Defender. \n\nBut wait, the key point here is that the PowerShell commands are using WebClient to download files from GitHub. While GitHub is legitimate, the use of PowerShell in this way could be part of a script that's doing more than just downloading a license. However, the logs don't show any other malicious activity beyond the downloads. The other events don't involve suspicious file paths, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. \n\nHowever, the repetition of the same command across different GitHub repositories might indicate that the user is doing something repetitive, but without further context, it's hard to tell. The fact that all the downloaded files are LICENSE.txt might be a red herring, but they could also be part of a legitimate process. \n\nConsidering all that, the logs don't show clear signs of malware or malicious activity. The PowerShell commands are using a common technique for downloading files, but since the sources are legitimate and there's no other suspicious activity, it might be a false positive. However, the presence of multiple such events could warrant further investigation to ensure that the user isn't using these commands for unintended purposes. But based on the given logs, there's not enough evidence to flag it as malicious. So, maybe the batch is not interesting for investigation unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs provided does not contain clear evidence of malicious activity, but there are a few notable points that warrant cautious attention:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Download Commands:**\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are used to download files from GitHub raw URLs (e.g., `https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\/LICENSE.txt`) and save them to temporary directories (`%TEMP%`). While GitHub is a legitimate source, this pattern could be part of:\n     - **Legitimate use:** Fetching license files or configuration data.\n     - **Suspicious use:** A cover for downloading payloads (though the filenames and URLs here are benign).\n\n2. **File Creation Events:**\n   - Files like `elemento_padrao.txt` and `entrada_base.txt` are created in the `Downloads` directory. These are typical for user-initiated downloads but could be flagged if the content is unexpected or if the files are later executed.\n\n3. **Repeated Registry Modifications:**\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events for processes like `chrome.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` are likely benign (e.g., configuration updates). However, repeated modifications could indicate tampering if correlated with other anomalies.\n\n4. **Legitimate Tools:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipping tool) and `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` (Windows Defender) are involved in normal operations (file creation, network connections). No suspicious behavior is observed here.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Not Clearly Malicious:** The logs do not show direct signs of malware, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.\n- **Potential for Further Investigation:** The repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub, while not inherently malicious, could be a red flag if:\n  - The downloaded files are later executed.\n  - The GitHub repositories are associated with known malicious activity.\n  - The user context (e.g., admin privileges, untrusted networks) is unknown.\n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor the downloaded files for unexpected execution or modification. If the user context is untrusted or the files are linked to suspicious repositories, further analysis is warranted."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe there's something else. Then there are multiple svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. Svchost is normal, but repeated registry changes might be a red flag. \n\nWait, there's a Calculator.exe entry, which is similar to calc.exe. But why is it loading urlmon.dll again? That's a system file, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task could be part of a cleanup after an attack. \n\nLooking further, there's a schtasks.exe process deleting the same task. Then, there's a cmd.exe command using REG DELETE to remove entries from the Run key in the registry. That's suspicious because modifying the Run key could be used to add persistence. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry events. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands. The presence of reg.exe deleting registry keys might indicate someone trying to remove traces. \n\nThe command lines show attempts to delete scheduled tasks and registry entries, which are common in post-exploitation activities. The repeated registry modifications and the use of cmd and reg to delete these entries could be signs of an attacker trying to remove their footprints. \n\nHowever, I should check if these actions are part of normal operations. For example, deleting a scheduled task might be a legitimate action, but combined with other suspicious activities like multiple registry changes and PowerShell usage, it's more likely malicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple suspicious activities that could indicate an ongoing attack or cleanup. Therefore, it's interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated registry modifications (RegistryEvent) by svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and cmd.exe; deletion of scheduled tasks (schtasks.exe) and registry Run keys; use of reg.exe for registry deletion; and process creation commands that may indicate cleanup or evasion techniques (e.g., deleting 'spawn' task, removing 'modulo_temporario' and 'pacote_auxiliar' registry entries).

There are several \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set\" events. But then there are some \"Image loaded\" events. The files loaded here are all standard Windows DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. Those seem legitimate. \n\nWait, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Creating and deleting a file might be normal, but sometimes attackers do that to execute scripts temporarily. However, the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which sounds like it could be part of a legitimate test or PowerShell's own processes. \n\nAlso, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably just part of normal operations. \n\nLooking at the command lines, most are just \"powershell.exe & {}\" which might be empty commands or placeholders. But there's one with a command line that includes a script path. However, the script is in the Temp directory and is deleted afterward. \n\nI should check if there are any unusual patterns.

The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several process creations and accesses, mostly involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. The 'whoami.exe' is also there, which is a normal utility to get user info. But the repetition of PowerShell being accessed and registry changes might be a red flag. \n\nWait, the 'Registry value set' events could be part of normal operations, but combined with multiple process creations and the loading of certain DLLs, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. However, the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender might be normal too, but I should check if there's any unusual activity.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe & {}' which seems like an empty command. That's odd. Maybe someone is testing or trying to execute something without proper commands. Also, the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory might be part of a script that's being tested, but the fact that it's being created and then deleted quickly could be a sign of something malicious trying to hide its tracks.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line. That might indicate a loop or a script that's not functioning correctly. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple registry values are being set might be part of a configuration change, but if done by a malicious actor, it could be to persist or modify system settings. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious payloads or network activity, which is a bit concerning.\n\nHmm, but the user mentioned to consider the combination of all events. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes, registry changes, and the creation\/deletion of a temporary script file might be indicative of a script-based attack. However, without seeing the actual content of the script or any network traffic, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut given that the events include both normal system processes and some suspicious activities like the empty PowerShell command and the temporary file, it's possible that this is a legitimate script being tested, but the repetition and the deletion might be suspicious. However, I need to make sure that I'm not overstepping. \n\nIn cybersecurity, any unusual activity, especially involving PowerShell and temporary files, is often a red flag.

That might be normal, but then there's a lot of powershell.exe activities. Registry value sets, pipe created, process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but excessive activity can be a red flag. \n\nThen there's chrome.exe doing similar things. But wait, Chrome usually doesn't interact with the registry that much. Multiple registry value sets from Chrome might be suspicious. Also, there are a few instances where files are created, like the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but maybe not.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line that says \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip\". Deleting a zip file might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a cleanup after some activity. Also, the image loads for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are normal for PowerShell, but maybe if they're loaded in an unusual context.\n\nWait, there's an entry where the process is 'whoami.exe', which is used to check the current user. That's usually benign, but if it's part of a sequence of commands, maybe it's being used for privilege checking.\n\nHowever, the majority of the events involve PowerShell and Chrome doing registry modifications and process accesses. The fact that Chrome is involved in so many registry events is a bit odd. Typically, Chrome's interactions with the registry are more about its own settings, not system-wide changes. \n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry value sets from different processes might indicate attempts to modify system settings or inject code. The 'Pipe Created' events could be related to inter-process communication, which isn't always bad, but combined with other events might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any direct evidence of malicious activity.

Creating and deleting a script might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities. However, just creating and deleting a file might not be enough to flag it as malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is running commands to remove various .zip and .txt files from the Temp directory. The commands use Remove-Item with ErrorAction Ignore, which is common in scripts to prevent errors if the file doesn't exist. But the sheer number of these removals might be suspicious. Why so many different files? Maybe part of a cleanup after an attack.\n\nThen, there's a Chrome process loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the same MpOAV.dll is also loaded by PowerShell, which might be okay if it's part of Defender's operations. However, if the file path is unusual or if it's not a legitimate Defender component, that could be a red flag. But the path here is the standard one, so maybe not.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might relate to PowerShell's internal processes, but without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of multiple 'Remove-Item' commands could indicate an attempt to delete evidence, which is a common post-exploitation activity.\n\nHowever, there's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity. The logs also include registry events and process accesses, but none of them immediately point to a security issue. \n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious activity is the repeated deletion of files in the Temp directory via PowerShell.
