{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The majority are related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections, which is normal for a browser. But then there's a bunch of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nFirst, there's a process creation event where powershell.exe runs a script that starts another process. The command line shows it's executing a batch file from various paths. Then there are image load events for .NET DLLs, which might be normal, but the presence of multiple image loads could indicate something. \n\nAlso, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of an attack to execute malicious code without leaving traces. \n\nAdditionally, there are several Pipe Created events and registry value changes. The registry events might be part of normal operations, but combined with the file creation\/deletion and the multiple process starts, it could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or payloads.\n\nThe fact that the same PowerShell command is being used multiple times with different paths might be a red flag. It could be part of a larger attack where the attacker is trying to run scripts from different locations to avoid detection. \n\nHowever, some of these events might be legitimate, like the .NET DLLs being loaded as part of normal PowerShell operations. But the combination of file creation\/deletion, multiple process starts, and registry changes does raise suspicion. \n\nOverall, the batch shows a mix of normal and potentially malicious activities. The key points are the suspicious file operations and the repeated use of PowerShell to start processes from various paths. This warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious behavior: creation and immediate deletion of a temporary script file, loading of .NET DLLs, and repeated execution of batch files from various paths.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Calculator.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. That's normal, but then there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. Not too suspicious yet. Then, an Image loaded event pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably okay.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line for powershell.exe that starts a process with a path that has \"..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of relative paths with \"..\" might be a red flag. It could be trying to access files outside the intended directory, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process created with a command line that includes \"entrada_geral_script.bat\". Again, the path here might be part of a larger script that's executing malicious code. Also, the file created by powershell.exe is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user files but could be a drop zone for malware.\n\nMultiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. Chrome is a common target for attacks, but just registry changes might not be enough. However, combined with other events, like the image loaded from amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender, that's normal. But if there's something unusual in the registry changes, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, there's a File created event for svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization folder. That's part of Windows Update, so that's normal. But the other file created in Downloads is more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple registry changes, the use of relative paths in command lines, and the creation of files in user directories might indicate that something is trying to execute scripts or modify the system. Even though some of the files are legitimate, the combination of events, especially the command lines with relative paths, could be signs of malicious activity. The fact that powershell.exe is involved in creating files and accessing processes is also a concern. So, this batch might be interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scripts with relative paths (e.g., '..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\...'), creation of files in user directories (e.g., Downloads), and repeated registry modifications by Chrome and PowerShell. These patterns may indicate potential malicious behavior or system compromise.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the JSONL data provided.\n\nMost of the entries are about chrome.exe performing a registry value set task. That's under the RegistryEvent rule. There are seven instances of this. Then there's one event about winlogbeat.exe creating a file, and another about powershell.exe creating a file. \n\nNow, thinking about what's normal. Chrome.exe modifying the registry could be normal, like updating settings or extensions. But if it's happening multiple times, maybe there's something else. However, seven times might be a lot. But maybe it's just a user interacting with Chrome, like changing preferences. But I should check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThe other events: winlogbeat.exe is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory might be normal, especially if it's part of an installation or setup. The path mentioned is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a temporary file during configuration. That's probably benign.\n\nThe powershell.exe event creating elemento_base.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. However, the name is generic, so maybe it's just a normal file. But if there's no other context, it's hard to tell. However, the justification here would be whether these events are out of the ordinary.\n\nBut the main thing here is that all the chrome.exe events are the same: registry value set. If this is a typical system, maybe it's normal. But if this is an unusual number of registry changes by Chrome, that could be a sign of something. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed, it's hard to say. But since all the events are the same and from Chrome, which is a common application, maybe it's not suspicious. The other events are about file creation, which are normal. \n\nWait, but the classification is whether the batch is interesting. Since all the events are similar and don't show any obvious malicious activity, maybe it's not interesting. However, if there's a pattern of multiple registry changes by Chrome, maybe that's worth looking into. But without more data, like the registry keys involved, it's hard to determine. The user might be just using Chrome normally. The other events don't seem suspicious either. So, overall, the batch might not be interesting. But I need to be careful. If all the registry events are from Chrome and are the same task, maybe they're just part of normal operations. So the justification would be that there's no suspicious activity detected. Hence, the classification is NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve standard processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing typical operations (registry updates, file creation) without patterns indicating malicious activity or anomalies.\"\n}"}
