{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through the events to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, which is normal, but also MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. Then chrome.exe has several network connections and DNS queries, which might be normal browsing, but the number of events could be a red flag. However, looking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user and adds them to the Domain Admins group. The command line includes \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands with domain parameters. That's suspicious because adding a user to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action and could indicate someone trying to escalate privileges or set up a backdoor.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process that runs \"net user\" with a username \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and a password that looks like a temporary one. Also, another command adds \"modulo_comum_Admin\" to Domain Admins. These actions are typically done by administrators, but if this is happening without proper authorization, it's a problem. The presence of multiple \"net\" and \"net1.exe\" commands (though net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool) could indicate someone trying to manipulate the network or domain settings.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a .winlogbeat.yml.new file and a pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the other file's purpose isn't clear. However, the main issue seems to be the command-line activities. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but combined with the network commands and user additions, it might be part of a larger attack. The fact that the user is adding themselves to Domain Admins suggests they might be trying to gain elevated privileges. \n\nI should check if the user accounts being added are legitimate. The names are in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but the password has \"temporario_pass123!\" which seems weak and possibly a placeholder, indicating a lack of security. \n\nThe presence of multiple network connections and DNS queries from chrome.exe could be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's a sign that something is happening. The key suspicious events are the command-line operations that modify domain users and groups. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch includes activities that modify domain admin groups, which is a high-risk action. Even though some processes are normal, the combination of adding users to Domain Admins and using potentially malicious commands (like net1.exe, which isn't standard) makes this batch interesting for investigation. The answer should highlight these points and suggest that this is a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **highly suspicious activities** that warrant investigation, indicating potential **malicious activity** or **security compromise**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities:**\n1. **Domain Admin Privilege Escalation:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process executed the following command:\n     ```\n     net user pacote_principal_Admin \"temporario_pass123!\" \/add\n     net group \"Domain Admins\" pacote_principal_Admin \/add\n     ```\n     - **Implication:** This adds a user (`pacote_principal_Admin`) to the **Domain Admins group**, granting them **full administrative control** over the domain. Such actions are typically restricted to authorized administrators and are a **red flag** for privilege escalation or insider threats.\n\n2. **Unusual Use of `net1.exe`:**\n   - A `net1.exe` process (non-standard, not a legitimate Windows tool) was used with domain-related commands:\n     ```\n     net1.exe user modulo_comum_Admin \"temporario_pass123!\" \/add\n     net1.exe group \"Domain Admins\" modulo_comum_Admin \/add\n     ```\n     - **Implication:** The use of `net1.exe` (likely a malicious or renamed tool) to manipulate domain users and groups suggests **malware or lateral movement** within the network.\n\n3. **PowerShell and Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes triggered **registry modifications** (`Registry value set`). PowerShell is often used for **automated attacks** (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration, or credential theft).\n\n4. **File Creation in Sensitive Locations:**\n   - A file named `pacote_base.txt` was created in the user's `Downloads` folder. While not inherently malicious, the context of the other activities (e.g., domain admin changes) raises concerns about **data exfiltration** or **malware configuration files**.\n\n5. **Unusual DNS Queries and Network Activity:**\n   - Chrome.exe and svchost.exe generated multiple **DNS queries** and **file creation events**. While some may be normal, the volume and context (e.g., alongside domain manipulation) could indicate **data exfiltration** or **malware communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Significant:**\n- **Domain Admin Access:** Adding users to the **Domain Admins group** is a **critical security risk**. This could allow an attacker to **compromise the entire domain**, install malware, or extract sensitive data.\n- **Use of Non-Standard Tools:** The use of `net1.exe` (not a legitimate Windows utility) suggests **malware** or **tool abuse** for domain manipulation.\n- **Lack of Authentication Context:** No evidence of **multi-factor authentication** or **approval** for these actions, which is highly unusual for domain-level changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation:**\n1. **Check for Unauthorized User Accounts:**\n   - Verify if `pacote_principal_Admin` or `modulo_comum_Admin` exist in Active Directory and whether they are legitimate.\n   - Audit login history for these accounts to detect unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Analyze `net1.exe`:**\n   - Determine the origin of `net1.exe` (e.g., file hash, digital signature) to confirm if it is malicious.\n   - Check for related processes or network connections.\n\n3. **Review PowerShell Logs:**\n   - Investigate the PowerShell commands executed to identify their purpose (e.g., persistence, data exfiltration).\n\n4. **Monitor Network Traffic:**\n   - Analyze DNS queries and network connections from Chrome.exe\/svchost.exe for signs of **data exfiltration** or **C2 communication**.\n\n5. **Review File Contents:**\n   - Examine the contents of `pacote_base.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` to determine if they contain **malicious payloads** or **configuration data**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs contains **clear evidence of suspicious activity**, particularly **domain admin privilege escalation** and **use of non-standard tools**. These actions are **highly indicative of a security incident** and require **immediate investigation** to mitigate risks and prevent further compromise."}
