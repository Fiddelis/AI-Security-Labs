{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries and MpDefenderCoreService.exe having network connections. Those seem normal. Chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections is also typical for a browser. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe command that's adding a user and adding someone to the Domain Admins group. The command line shows \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands with domain admin privileges. That's a red flag. Adding users to Domain Admins is a high-privilege action and could indicate someone is trying to escalate privileges or set up backdoor accounts.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry, which might be part of configuring something malicious. The file creation events include a .yml.new file for winlogbeat and a pacote_base.txt. The winlogbeat file might be part of log management, but the pacote_base.txt isn't clear. However, the repeated file creation by svchost.exe in SRUtmp.log seems normal, as that's a system log file.\n\nBut the key point here is the command that adds a user to Domain Admins with a temporary password. That's a clear sign of potential compromise. Even though some events are normal, the presence of these specific commands and the multiple process accesses and registry changes make this batch suspicious. It's not just a few isolated events but a combination that suggests an attacker might be trying to gain control over the domain. So, the classification should be INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of domain admin user 'pacote_principal_Admin' with temporary password via 'net user' command 2) Addition of users to 'Domain Admins' group 3) Unusual PowerShell and cmd.exe activity with registry modifications 4) File creation of potential configuration files. These patterns suggest potential privilege escalation and account compromise attempts.\"\n}"}
