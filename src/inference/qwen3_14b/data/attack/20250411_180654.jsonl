{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value set events related to chrome.exe. A lot of registry changes might be normal, but if it's excessive, it could be a sign of something. However, chrome.exe doing that might be part of its normal operations, like updating settings. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to get user info. But then there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag. Keystroke logging is typically associated with malware, like keyloggers. The script is being executed multiple times with different paths, which might be an attempt to evade detection by changing the location each time.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. While some of these are standard, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, the repeated loading could be part of a malicious payload. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths suggests that the attacker is trying to execute a keylogger script through different directories, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nThe command lines for powershell.exe are similar, all invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with the same log path. This repetition might indicate a persistent attempt to log keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious activity. Even though some events are from legitimate processes like chrome.exe, the combination with the keylogger script and the multiple attempts to execute it points towards a security threat.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the presence of a keylogger script executed via PowerShell multiple times, along with the loading of .NET assemblies, suggests a potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is concerning. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with different paths, attempting to log keystrokes to temporary files. This is highly suspicious behavior indicative of keylogging malware, combined with .NET DLL image loads that may support malicious payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The command lines mention executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information. The fact that it's being run multiple times from different paths (modulo_padrao, elemento_base, tarefa_base) might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing locations.\n\nThen there's the file creation and deletion events. Files are being created in temporary directories and then immediately deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. The FileDeleteDetected event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 suggests that a script was created and then removed, which could be part of a malicious payload execution.\n\nAlso, there's an event where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with a file path pointing to Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That might indicate a remote command execution, which is a security concern.\n\nHowever, some of the other events, like the ImageLoad for Windows Defender DLLs and normal file creations (like winlogbeat.yml.new) might be benign. But the repeated use of PowerShell for keystroke logging and the suspicious file paths make me think this is malicious.\n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the combination of multiple keystroke logging attempts, temporary file creation\/deletion, and remote command execution points towards a potential security threat. So I'd classify this as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances execute suspicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) with keystroke logging capabilities, writing to temporary directories. This pattern, combined with file creation\/deletion events in transient locations, suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
