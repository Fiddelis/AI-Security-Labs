{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry might be normal, but multiple entries could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe just regular activity.\n\nWait, here's a line: powershell.exe running with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and logging to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds suspicious. Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is often associated with keylogging malware. Logging keystrokes is a red flag. Also, the path is in the temporary directory, which is common for malware to store data without being noticed.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of ImageLoad events for various .dll files related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate system files, the fact that they're being loaded by powershell.exe might be part of a malicious payload, especially if combined with the keystroke logging script.\n\nAlso, there are several instances of the same command line pattern with different paths, all involving Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition could indicate an attempt to execute the same malicious script multiple times, possibly to ensure it runs or to bypass detection.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for powershell.exe with different command lines suggests that there's an ongoing effort to execute scripts. Even though some entries are about registry changes, the keylogging script is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of powershell.exe executing a keystroke logging script, multiple attempts to run it from different paths, and the use of temporary directories for logging points to a potential security threat. This batch is interesting because it shows signs of malware trying to capture keystrokes, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in $env:TEMP, indicating potential keystroke logging malware.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll scan through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes it can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a PowerShell command that's executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logging keystrokes to a temporary file. That's definitely suspicious because keystroke logging is a sign of a keylogger, which is malicious. \n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell creates and deletes temporary files. Creating a file and then deleting it might be part of an attempt to hide activities. Also, the script paths mentioned, like C:\\modulo_padrao\\pacote_secundario..., don't look standard. They seem like custom paths, which could indicate malware.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths. That's a red flag because it's the same malicious script being used multiple times. Also, there's an entry where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is another instance of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That suggests someone might be executing commands remotely, which is a security risk.\n\nI also notice some legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe creating files, but those are normal activities. However, the PowerShell activities stand out. The key points here are the keystroke logging, the use of PowerShell for executing scripts, and the multiple instances of the same suspicious script. Even though some entries are normal, the presence of these malicious indicators makes the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath parameter, indicating potential keystroke logging. Repeated use of non-standard paths (e.g., 'modulo_padrao', 'tarefa_base') and temporary file creation\/deletion patterns suggest suspicious behavior consistent with malware activity.\"\n}"}
