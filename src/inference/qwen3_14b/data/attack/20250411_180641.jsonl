{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple chrome.exe processes with NetworkConnect events. That's normal, since Chrome does a lot of network activity. But then there's powershell.exe and ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be a vector for attacks. However, just having ProcessAccess might not be enough.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own. But then more PowerShell events, and then a RegistryEvent. Hmm. Then there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line involving csc.exe, which is the C# compiler. The command line looks like it's compiling some code and executing a temp file. That's a red flag. Compiling code in temp directories can be part of an attack, especially if the generated executable is malicious.\n\nNext, csc.exe creates a file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's common, but the file names like 'pacote_logico.exe' and 'unidade_padrao.exe' are generic and might be used to hide malicious payloads. Then, the logs show ImageLoad events for various DLLs, some of which are part of the .NET framework. But the executable 'modulo_secundario.exe' loading mscoree.dll and others could be normal, but combined with the temp files, it's suspicious.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe changing registry values might be normal, but the other processes like 'estrutura_ativo.exe' and 'modulo_temporario.exe' loading DLLs from system directories could be part of a legitimate process. However, the presence of multiple temp files and the use of cmd.exe and PowerShell to execute these might indicate something malicious.\n\nAlso, the command line in the cmd.exe process includes compiling code and executing temp files, which is often seen in malware. The fact that there are multiple process creations, file creations, and image loads from temp directories suggests that this could be an attempt to execute a payload or install malware.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes multiple suspicious activities like using PowerShell and cmd.exe to execute compiled code from temp directories, creating executable files in temporary locations, and loading various DLLs. These are common indicators of malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Compilation of code via csc.exe in temporary directories (common in malware distribution), 2) Execution of generated executables (e.g., 'pacote_logico.exe', 'unidade_padrao.exe'), 3) Unusual image loading of .NET framework components from system directories, 4) Frequent registry modifications by non-system processes, 5) Suspicious command-line arguments in cmd.exe indicating potential payload execution. These patterns are consistent with malware execution or attacker persistence techniques.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost.exe and chrome.exe. But I notice that Calculator.exe is mentioned a few times. Wait, normally, the calculator is calc.exe, not Calculator.exe. Maybe that's a typo or a different executable. Could be a red flag if it's not the standard process.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a file there might be normal, but maybe the file path is something to check. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which sounds like a configuration file. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple Registry value set events from svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. A lot of registry changes could be normal, but if they're all from the same process or in a short time frame, it might indicate something. However, the logs don't show a time frame, so that's a factor.\n\nThe Image loaded events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so loading it might be normal. Amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so that's also a system file. But if these are being loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, there's a mix of calc.exe and Calculator.exe. That inconsistency might be a mistake in the logs or a different executable. Maybe an attacker is using a different name to avoid detection. But without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the repeated Registry events from chrome.exe could be normal if it's updating settings, but again, not sure.\n\nThe winlogbeat file creation is repeated twice. Maybe that's just a normal part of its operation. However, if there are other events that indicate unauthorized access or unusual activity, that would be a concern. But from the given data, there's no clear sign of that.\n\nOverall, I don't see any obvious malicious activities. The events seem to be a mix of normal system processes and legitimate activities. The Calculator.exe vs calc.exe discrepancy might be a minor red flag, but not enough to classify this as interesting without more context. So, I think this batch is not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard system processes (calc.exe, svchost.exe, chrome.exe) and benign activities like registry updates and file creation by winlogbeat.exe. No suspicious patterns, unusual file paths, or anomalous process behavior are observed.\"\n}"}
