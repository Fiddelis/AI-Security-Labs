{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a powershell.exe process with a registry value set. Not too suspicious yet. Then, the second event is cmd.exe running a command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. Wait, the script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. The name \"NonExistingScript\" might be a red flag because it suggests the script doesn't exist, which could be a sign of a malicious attempt to execute a non-existent file, maybe trying to bypass detection.\n\nThen there's another entry with schtasks.exe creating a scheduled task again, this time with a different script path: c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" in the name. That's consistent. Scheduled tasks running PowerShell with bypassed execution policy could be an indicator of compromise. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's a concerning configuration.\n\nThere are multiple entries for svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. But svchost.exe is a common system process, and chrome.exe having multiple registry events might be normal if the user is interacting with the browser. However, the repeated registry events could be part of legitimate activity or something else. But the key points here are the scheduled tasks and the PowerShell commands.\n\nAlso, there are file creation events for winlogbeat.exe and some text files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing files and the scheduled tasks might indicate someone trying to set up persistence on the system.\n\nAnother thing is that the same scheduled task name \"win32times\" is used in multiple entries. That might be a red flag if it's an unusual task name. Also, the use of -ep bypass in PowerShell is typically used to bypass execution policies, which is often done by malicious scripts to run without being blocked.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with PowerShell using bypass, non-existent script names, and running under the system account points towards potential malicious activity. Even though there are some normal processes like chrome.exe and svchost.exe, the suspicious elements here are significant enough to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with PowerShell using -ep bypass (common in attacks), references to non-existent scripts (potential obfuscation), and repeated registry modifications. These indicators suggest possible malicious persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
