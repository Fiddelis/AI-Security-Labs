{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, powershell.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Then there's a cmd.exe command that runs systeminfo and reg query on the Disk Enum key. That seems normal, but maybe the combination of multiple registry changes and process creations could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, systeminfo.exe is loaded with amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender files, so that's probably legitimate. But then there's a calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL, but maybe if it's unexpected, that could be an issue. However, Calculator.exe is a common process, so maybe not.\n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. That's normal, but the command line has -secured and -Embedding, which might be standard. The svchost.exe processes creating event logs (Parameters.evtx and State.evtx) – that's part of normal system operations, so probably not suspicious.\n\nThere's also a reg.exe querying the same Disk Enum key again. Then conhost.exe and services.exe events, which are typical. The winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file – that's part of configuration, so maybe a user is setting up something, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, looking for patterns: multiple registry modifications, process creations, and image loads. But most of these are standard system processes. However, the presence of multiple registry changes, especially from cmd.exe and powershell.exe, could indicate someone trying to modify system settings. But without more context, like unusual registry keys or unexpected commands, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the cmd.exe command line includes reg query on the Disk Enum key. That's part of checking disk information, which is normal. The systeminfo command is also standard. The use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe is common, but if there were other suspicious activities like downloading files or connecting to external IPs, that would be a concern. However, in these logs, there's no mention of network connections or file downloads beyond the winlogbeat configuration file, which seems legitimate.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The majority are normal system processes and legitimate operations. Unless there's a specific rule that flags these actions, but based on the information given, there's no obvious attack pattern. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as there's no clear malicious behavior detected.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system operations (e.g., registry queries, process creation, legitimate DLL loading) and benign user activities (e.g., systeminfo, calculator). No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or malicious payloads are evident.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the entries are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but when it's done excessively, it might indicate something. However, there are also a couple of other processes mentioned. \n\nLooking at the 'winlogbeat.exe' event, it's creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal if it's part of its setup. But the filename has a .new extension, which sometimes is used during file creation or updates. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' creating a text file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. PowerShell creating files isn't inherently bad, but depending on the context. If it's part of a script that's benign, it's okay. However, if it's creating files in unusual locations or with unusual names, that could be a red flag. The name here seems generic, though.\n\nNow, looking at the 'Image loaded' events for chrome.exe, one of them is loading 'amsi.dll' from the Windows System32 directory. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. The other is 'MpOAV.dll' from the Windows Defender Platform. That also seems legitimate. So those might be normal operations.\n\nBut wait, the same process (chrome.exe) is repeatedly setting registry values. If this is a legitimate application, it might be updating its own settings. However, if it's being used as a vector for malicious activity, like modifying registry keys to persist or change behavior, that's a problem. But with the given data, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The events don't show any unusual paths, unexpected processes, or signs of exploitation. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be normal if the application is updating its configurations. However, the repetition might be worth checking. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or any other anomalous behavior, it's hard to say. The other events don't seem to indicate any immediate threat. \n\nSo, the batch has some potentially normal activities. The classification might be 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.6 because while there's some unusual activity, it's not definitively malicious. But maybe I should check if there's a pattern. For example, if the registry changes are related to known malicious activity, but without more info, it's hard to tell. So, the justification would be that while there are multiple registry changes and file creations, they don't show clear signs of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains routine activities like Chrome.exe modifying registry values and loading legitimate system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). File creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe appear benign and contextually normal (configuration files, text files). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
