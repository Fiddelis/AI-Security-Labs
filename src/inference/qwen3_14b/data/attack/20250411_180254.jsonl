{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing a DNS query, powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry changes. The cmd.exe entry has a command line that includes 'systeminfo' and querying the registry under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum. That seems like normal system info gathering, maybe part of a legitimate process, but could also be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThen there's systeminfo.exe being created and loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender files, so that's probably legitimate. But then there's a Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL, but maybe if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a WmiPrvSE.exe process, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes '-secured -Embedding', which might be normal. However, the image loaded is wmiutils.dll, which is part of the WMI infrastructure, so that's likely okay.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe creating files in the Windows Event Logs directory. That might be normal if it's part of system logging, but the filenames like Parameters.evtx and State.evtx could be unusual. However, svchost.exe is a common host process for system services, so this might be legitimate.\n\nAnother point is the use of reg.exe querying the same registry key as before. That's part of the systeminfo command, so again, possibly normal. The presence of multiple registry events and process creations might indicate someone is trying to gather system information, which is a common first step in an attack.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. However, if this is unexpected, it could be an indicator of someone trying to set up data exfiltration.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple processes accessing the registry, creating files, and loading DLLs. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary. Some of these are standard system processes, but the combination might suggest an attacker is trying to map the system, modify configurations, or set up tools. However, without more context, like unusual network activity or unexpected command-line arguments, it's hard to say for sure. The presence of legitimate processes doesn't necessarily mean it's benign, but the lack of clear malicious indicators (like downloading suspicious files, connecting to known bad IPs, or executing scripts) makes it a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned to analyze the entire batch as a whole. The fact that there are multiple registry modifications, process creations, and file creations could be part of a legitimate system activity, like a software installation or a system update. However, the repeated use of cmd.exe and powershell.exe with registry queries might be more indicative of an attacker's reconnaissance phase. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to determine. \n\nIn some cases, this level of activity might be normal in a corporate environment where system monitoring tools are in use. But if this is from a system that's not expected to have such activity, it could be a sign of compromise. Since the answer needs to be based on the given data, and there's no clear malicious activity (like downloading payloads, executing unknown scripts, etc.), it's on the fence. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and process creations could be considered suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes a mix of legitimate system activities and potential indicators of reconnaissance or system manipulation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - **System Information Gathering:**  \n     - `cmd.exe` and `systeminfo.exe` querying registry keys (e.g., `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum`) and executing `systeminfo` are standard for system diagnostics.  \n     - `reg.exe` querying the same registry paths aligns with typical system inventory tasks.  \n   - **Windows Defender Components:**  \n     - `systeminfo.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender modules) is expected during system checks.  \n   - **WMI and svchost.exe:**  \n     - `WmiPrvSE.exe` and `svchost.exe` creating files in the Windows Event Logs directory (`Parameters.evtx`, `State.evtx`) may be part of system logging or service management.  \n\n2. **Potential Indicators of Reconnaissance or Manipulation:**\n   - **Frequent Registry Modifications:**  \n     - Multiple entries involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` modifying registry keys (e.g., `Registry value set`) could indicate attempts to alter system configurations or extract sensitive data.  \n   - **Unusual File Creation:**  \n     - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file in a user's Downloads directory might suggest configuration changes for log shipping tools, though this could be legitimate if part of a monitoring setup.  \n   - **Calculator.exe and urlmon.dll:**  \n     - `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` (a standard Windows component) is unusual for this process and could hint at unexpected behavior.  \n\n3. **Lack of Clear Malicious Activity:**  \n   - No direct evidence of malware (e.g., suspicious network connections, payload downloads, or execution of unknown scripts) is present.  \n   - The presence of tools like `winlogbeat.exe` (a log shipper) and `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` (a host for Windows applications) may be part of routine system operations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events include **normal system behaviors** (e.g., `systeminfo`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`), the **frequency of registry modifications**, **unusual process-DLL interactions** (e.g., `Calculator.exe` with `urlmon.dll`), and **file creation by winlogbeat.exe** in a user directory could warrant further investigation. These patterns may suggest **reconnaissance** or **configuration changes**, but **no definitive malicious activity** is observed.  \n\n**Verdict:** **Suspicious but inconclusive.** The batch merits closer scrutiny to rule out unauthorized system manipulation or reconnaissance, especially if the context (e.g., user behavior, network activity) is not aligned with the observed events."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about 'Registry value set' events related to chrome.exe and Calculator.exe. There's also a few 'Image loaded' events. The first thing that stands out is that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry modifications. But wait, is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own purposes, like settings or updates. However, the number of events here seems high. Let me count: there are around 18 entries, most of which are chrome.exe doing registry tasks. \n\nThen there are two 'Image loaded' events. One is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That's a legitimate file, so loading that might be normal. The other is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender as well. So those are probably legitimate. But why is chrome.exe loading these? Maybe it's part of some integration or scanning process. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. Then there's a powershell.exe creating a text file. That's more suspicious. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt' doesn't immediately ring a bell. However, if that's part of a normal process, maybe it's okay. But combined with other events?\n\nWait, the main thing here is that chrome.exe is modifying the registry a lot. But is that a red flag? Well, if an application is making a lot of registry changes, especially if it's not typical for that application, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, Chrome does use the registry for various purposes. But the sheer number of events might be unusual. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry modifications without any obvious reason could be suspicious.\n\nBut looking at the other events, there's no obvious malicious activity. The image loaded events are for legitimate files. The file creation by winlogbeat and powershell seems normal. However, the large number of registry events from chrome.exe might indicate something. Maybe a script or malware is using chrome.exe as a vector to modify the registry. Alternatively, it could be a false positive or a normal process that's being logged excessively.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of both registry changes and image loads. If a malicious process is injecting code into chrome.exe, it might load suspicious DLLs. But in this case, the DLLs are from legitimate sources. So maybe not. \n\nBut the justification needs to be concise. The key points are: multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe, which could be normal, but combined with other events, maybe not. However, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show obvious signs like unauthorized access, suspicious file paths, or known malicious hashes. The file created by powershell is a text file, which isn't inherently malicious. The winlogbeat activity is normal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the batch might not be interesting. The events don't show clear signs of malicious behavior. The registry changes by chrome.exe could be part of normal operations, especially if the system is running a lot of chrome processes. The other events are benign. Therefore, the classification would be 'NOT INTERESTING' because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity with Chrome.exe performing legitimate registry modifications and loading expected system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No suspicious file paths, unusual processes, or indicators of compromise are present. The winlogbeat and PowerShell file creations appear benign.\"\n}"}
