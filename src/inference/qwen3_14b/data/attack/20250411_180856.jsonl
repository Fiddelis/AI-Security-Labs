{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see cmd.exe running a command to create a notepad.exe process. That's a bit odd because using wmic to start notepad isn't typical. Maybe a red herring, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and some Defender DLLs. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is using it, that's normal. But if it's being loaded by something like WMIC, that might be suspicious. Also, the paths for the Defender DLLs seem legitimate, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code into these DLLs. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file could be normal. But maybe the file path is unusual or the name has a .new extension, which sometimes is used in temporary files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are also multiple registry events, like Registry value set by powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding suspicious entries, that's a problem. However, the events here don't specify which registry keys are being modified, so it's hard to assess.\n\nAnother point is the presence of 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a standard app, but loading urlmon.dll might be normal for some operations. However, if it's part of a larger pattern of unexpected DLLs being loaded, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nI also notice that some events have \"None\" for the process or task, which might indicate incomplete logs or errors, but not necessarily malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, there are some suspicious activities like WMIC loading certain DLLs, the use of wmic to start notepad, and multiple registry changes. However, many of these could be part of normal system operations or benign processes. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there are enough anomalies that warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC.exe loading Defender-related DLLs (potential tampering), cmd.exe using WMIC to spawn notepad.exe (unusual process creation), and numerous registry modification events by privileged processes. These patterns may indicate lateral movement or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first batch, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If WMIC is loading that, maybe it's legitimate, but sometimes attackers use WMIC to execute commands. Also, the command line in one of the entries is \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe\" which is a common technique for process injection. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the presence of .yml.new could indicate someone is trying to modify the configuration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the second batch, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard tool to check user context, so maybe part of a script. But combined with the previous WMIC and PowerShell access events, it might be part of a larger attack. The repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could indicate someone is trying to manipulate or monitor processes.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of WMIC with command injection, PowerShell access attempts, and the creation of a config file might be signs of an attack. However, some of these could be legitimate. But the combination of these events, especially the command line execution via WMIC, raises suspicion. So I think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **indicators of potential malicious activity** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key suspicious elements:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious Command Execution via `WMIC`**\n- **Event**:  \n  `cmd.exe \/c wmic process call create notepad.exe`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  This is a classic technique used by attackers to **execute arbitrary commands** through `WMIC` (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line). While `notepad.exe` is a benign process, the use of `WMIC` for process creation is often associated with **malware persistence** or **command-and-control (C2) communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual DLL Loading by `WMIC.exe`**\n- **Events**:  \n  - `WMIC.exe` loading `amsi.dll` (part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface)  \n  - `WMIC.exe` loading `MpOAV.dll` (Microsoft Defender Antivirus)  \n  **Risk**:  \n  Legitimate processes like `WMIC.exe` typically do not load security-related DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). This could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **malware masquerading as a legitimate process**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. PowerShell Process Access and Execution**\n- **Events**:  \n  - Repeated `ProcessAccess` events for `powershell.exe`  \n  - `powershell.exe` executing `whoami.exe` (to check user context)  \n  **Risk**:  \n  PowerShell is a common tool for **post-exploitation activities** (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement). The repeated `ProcessAccess` events may indicate **process injection** or **monitoring of system processes**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. File Creation by `winlogbeat.exe`**\n- **Event**:  \n  - `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file:  \n    `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log-shipper tool, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory could indicate **tampering with configuration files** or **malicious use of log-shipping tools** (e.g., exfiltrating data).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Unusual Logon Events**\n- **Events**:  \n  - `Special Logon` event with `process=None`  \n  - `Logon` event for `services.exe`  \n  **Risk**:  \n  `Special Logon` events may indicate **non-standard authentication** (e.g., impersonation, service account misuse). The absence of a process in the `Special Logon` event is also unusual and could signal **tampering with logon mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `notepad.exe`) are benign, the combination of **`WMIC` command injection**, **unusual DLL loading**, **PowerShell process access**, and **suspicious file creation** strongly suggests **potential adversarial activity**. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Analyzing the full command-line arguments for `WMIC` and `PowerShell`.\n- Checking for **unauthorized modifications** to `winlogbeat` configuration files.\n- Correlating these events with **network traffic** (e.g., DNS queries, C2 communication).\n- Reviewing **file integrity** (e.g., hash analysis of `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`).\n\nThis batch **merits immediate attention** as it could indicate a **compromise or ongoing attack**."}
