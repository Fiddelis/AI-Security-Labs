{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing a DNS query, which is normal. Then powershell.exe is involved in several events. The command line for some powershell processes is just getting the date, which seems benign. But then there are multiple image loads related to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard for PowerShell, but maybe loading so many could be a red flag? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily. The file path is in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a typical place for such activities. Also, the name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a misleading name to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are several events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but repeated entries could indicate something. Also, the process 'conhost.exe' and 'winlogbeat.exe' are involved in file creation, but winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation. However, the other file created by powershell.exe in Downloads folder named 'estrutura_logico.txt' seems less suspicious, maybe just a regular file.\n\nLooking at the registry events and process access, nothing immediately alarming. But the combination of creating and deleting a script file in Temp, along with multiple image loads of .NET components, might suggest an attempt to execute a script that's being cleaned up afterward. The use of PowerShell for such actions is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts, but the temporary file creation and deletion is a behavior often seen in malicious scripts to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be part of a larger process that's being monitored or manipulated. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that a script was created and deleted quickly, along with the image loads, does raise some flags. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 0.65. It's not definitive proof of malicious activity, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including temporary script file creation\/deletion in the Temp directory (C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\...), repeated image loading of .NET framework components (mscoree.dll, clr.dll), and registry modification events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants to know if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. The events include registry value sets, process accesses, image loads, file creations, and deletions. \n\nOne thing I notice is the multiple image loads related to .NET frameworks, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard .NET components, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1, which is then deleted. Creating and deleting temporary files could be part of a script execution, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events might be suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the involvement of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might indicate that the system is interacting with antivirus components, but if there's a registry change here, maybe something is trying to disable or modify Defender's settings. However, in the given events, there's a registry value set event, but no clear indication of tampering with Defender's configurations.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation, like setting up new configurations. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of someone trying to configure or tamper with log shipping settings.\n\nThe repetition of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events with the same command line (Get-Date) might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of these events, it could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context on the typical behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are several PowerShell activities and file operations, none of the events clearly point to malicious activity. The presence of standard system processes and legitimate operations (like creating temporary files or configuring log beat) might be normal. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, file creations, and PowerShell usage could warrant further investigation to ensure there's no hidden malicious activity. But based solely on the events provided, it's not conclusive. So, maybe the answer is that it's not clearly malicious, but could be suspicious and worth looking into more.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of events includes a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior** that may warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` events involving `powershell.exe` are logged. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, **frequent registry modifications and process access** could indicate attempts to manipulate system settings or execute scripts.\n   - The command `Get-Date` (a benign PowerShell command) is repeatedly logged in `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events. This may be part of **normal logging or testing**, but the repetition could suggest **automation or monitoring**.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1`) is **created and deleted** in the `Temp` directory. This pattern is common during **script execution** but could also be used to **hide malicious payloads**.\n   - A file (`estrutura_logico.txt`) is created in the `Downloads` directory by `powershell.exe`. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **data exfiltration** or **logging** if the file's content is unexpected.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates a configuration file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`). This is a **normal operation** for log shippers, but if the file's contents are unreviewed or tampered with, it could indicate **configuration changes** by an attacker.\n\n4. **Windows Defender Interaction**:\n   - The presence of `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components) in `Image loaded` events is **normal**. However, **registry modifications** involving these processes could signal **attempts to disable or bypass antivirus protections** (though no direct evidence of this is present here).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional information (e.g., file contents, user context, or correlation with other logs), it's challenging to confirm malicious intent.\n- **PowerShell Misuse**: While PowerShell is legitimate, **excessive use** for registry changes or file operations may indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration).\n- **Temporary File Behavior**: The creation and deletion of temporary files could be a **red flag** if tied to **unauthorized script execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **do not definitively indicate a security incident**, but they **raise enough suspicion** to warrant further investigation. Key actions include:\n- **Reviewing file contents** (e.g., `estrutura_logico.txt`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`) for anomalies.\n- **Correlating with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if PowerShell is being used for **malicious purposes**.\n- **Monitoring registry changes** related to Windows Defender or security tools for signs of tampering.\n\n**Verdict**: **Suspicious but not conclusive**â€”investigate further for context."}
