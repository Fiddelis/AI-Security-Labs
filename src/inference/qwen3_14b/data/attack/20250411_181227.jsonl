{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, with triggers set to at logon. The principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with high run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights can be a sign of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nNow, there are multiple entries with different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. Each of these is a scheduled task being registered. The repetition of similar commands with different names might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which is suspicious. Also, the fact that they're using PowerShell to create these tasks is concerning because it's a common method for attackers to bypass detection.\n\nThen there are other events like registry value sets and process accesses. However, the key part here is the scheduled task creation. The use of \"calc.exe\" is a classic example of a benign payload, but in this context, it's being used as a test or a way to execute code under admin rights. The high run level and the group administrators suggest that the attacker is trying to maintain persistence with elevated privileges.\n\nAdditionally, the image loads for .NET DLLs might be part of the PowerShell execution, but they aren't necessarily malicious on their own. However, combined with the scheduled task creation, it's more indicative of a potential security threat.\n\nThe presence of multiple scheduled tasks being created with similar patterns, along with the PowerShell commands, points towards a possible attack. Even though some of the events are normal (like chrome.exe and other process accesses), the combination of these PowerShell events is what stands out. The confidence here is high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges is a known attack vector. So, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting investigation, with a **high confidence level** (90%+). Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations via PowerShell**:\n   - **Command Pattern**: Repeated use of `New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"` with triggers set to \"At Logon\" and elevated privileges (`RunLevel Highest`).\n   - **Administrative Privilege**: Tasks are registered under `BUILTIN\\Administrators`, suggesting **privilege escalation** or **persistence mechanisms**.\n   - **Task Names**: Unique task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `tarefa_geral`) imply **multiple staged attacks** or attempts to evade detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell as a Vector**:\n   - PowerShell is used to inject and execute code, a common technique in **post-exploitation phases** (e.g., establishing persistence, lateral movement).\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loads**:\n   - Loading of `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is consistent with **PowerShell execution via .NET** (e.g., using `Start-Process` or `Invoke-Expression`), which can obfuscate malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Lack of Benign Context**:\n   - While `calc.exe` is a benign payload, its use here is **likely a test** (e.g., verifying task execution) or a **staging step** for further attacks (e.g., executing more隐蔽 payloads later).\n\n### Why This Matters:\n- **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks with admin privileges are a **common method for attackers** to maintain access across reboots.\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Use of `RunLevel Highest` suggests the attacker may have **compromised admin credentials** or exploited a vulnerability to gain elevated rights.\n- **Attack Chain**: The logs align with the **\"Compromise\" → \"Persistence\" → \"Privilege Escalation\"** phases of an attack lifecycle.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps:\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for additional PowerShell activity, network connections, or file modifications.\n- **Inspect Task Details**: Verify if the scheduled tasks are legitimate or if they point to unexpected executables.\n- **Check User Context**: Determine which user account executed the PowerShell commands (e.g., admin vs. standard user).\n- **YARA Rule Analysis**: Use rules targeting PowerShell-based task creation or .NET-based obfuscation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate investigation. The combination of **elevated privilege exploitation**, **scheduled task persistence**, and **PowerShell-based execution** strongly suggests a **security incident**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal, but then there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That's a red flag. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might indicate something malicious. Then, looking at the command line for powershell.exe, there's a script that's creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges for the Administrators group. That's definitely suspicious. The command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a common test, but in a real scenario, it could be a backdoor or malicious payload. The fact that it's setting the RunLevel to Highest means it's running with admin rights, which is a big security risk.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome might legitimately modify the registry, multiple entries in a short time could indicate tampering. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to tell. But combined with the other events, it might be part of a broader attack.\n\nThe later events have \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process information. That's concerning because it suggests someone is trying to run commands remotely, which could be part of a penetration attempt or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a scheduled task with admin privileges, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the remote command execution attempts all point towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here is indicative of an attack. The confidence is high because these are classic signs of compromise in a Windows environment.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scheduled tasks with admin privileges, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but maybe something's up if it's loading unexpected files. Then there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is normal, but repeated registry changes could indicate tampering.\n\nThen there's a file created in the Tasks directory named 'unidade_comum' by svchost. That path seems a bit odd. Next, there are several PowerShell and Chrome events. PowerShell creating files in user directories might be normal, but the presence of multiple file creations and registry changes could be suspicious.\n\nThe 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no process listed might be a red flag. That could mean someone is trying to run commands without proper authentication. Also, Chrome loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll—those are legitimate, but maybe the context here is different. The repeated registry events from Chrome could be a sign of something trying to modify settings.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat creating files in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal, but the presence of multiple file creations and the remote command events might indicate an investigation is needed. The confidence is a bit low because some of these events could be benign, but the combination of remote commands and unusual file paths might be enough to flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, 2) svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows Tasks directory ('unidade_comum'), 3) repeated registry modifications by Chrome and svchost.exe, and 4) PowerShell creating files in user directories.
