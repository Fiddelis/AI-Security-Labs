{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see a lot of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, it's executing a series of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a classic sign of reconnaissance, which is often part of an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET framework and Windows Defender. While loading .NET DLLs might be normal, the fact that it's loading multiple system DLLs could be part of a legitimate process or maybe an attempt to inject code. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be normal if Defender is active, but I should note that.\n\nThere's a File Create and then File Delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Creating and then deleting a script might be an attempt to execute something without leaving traces. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which could be a legitimate test, but combined with the other commands, it's suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events, which might be related to the PowerShell process initializing or something else, but not necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell executing commands to gather system information, loading multiple DLLs, creating and deleting a script file, and the repetition of events could indicate an attacker trying to explore the system. Even though some activities are normal, the pattern and the specific commands executed are concerning. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell commands executed, including system reconnaissance (net user, get-localgroupmember, ls C:\/Users), temporary script creation\/deletion, and repeated provider lifecycle events, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. First, I need to look for any suspicious activities. There are multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which is often used in attacks. One event shows a command line with commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and listing user directories. That seems like someone is trying to gather user information, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal, but not necessarily suspicious. However, another file created by powershell.exe named 'pacote_ativo.txt' is in the user's Downloads. Not sure yet, but maybe benign.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' running 'user' commands. Wait, 'net1.exe' might be a typo or a malicious file impersonating net.exe. That's suspicious because legitimate network commands would use net.exe, not net1.exe. That could indicate a malicious process trying to mimic a legitimate one.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry events from chrome.exe. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, so that might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a sign of something else. However, the majority of the events here are about process creation and access, especially with powershell.exe and some unusual processes.\n\nThe 'updater.exe' from Google's updater is legitimate, but the command line seems normal. The 'SDXHelper.exe' loading combase.dll is part of Windows, so that's probably okay. The 'cmdkey.exe \/list' is a legitimate command to list stored credentials, but combined with other commands, it might be part of credential harvesting.\n\nThe 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management' events without a process might be system events, but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination of these events with the suspicious processes and commands makes me think there's an attempt to gather system information and possibly credentials.\n\nOverall, the presence of multiple powershell.exe commands that are enumerating users and credentials, along with the suspicious 'net1.exe', points towards a potential security threat. Even though some processes are legitimate, the overall pattern is concerning. So, I should flag this as suspicious and recommend further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that could indicate a security threat. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n### **1. PowerShell Enumeration Commands**\n- **Multiple entries** show PowerShell executing commands like:\n  - `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `dir C:\\Users`, `get-childitem C:\\Users`, `net localgroup`.\n  - These commands **enumerate user accounts, groups, and file systems**, which is often seen in **reconnaissance phases of attacks** (e.g., credential harvesting or lateral movement).\n\n### **2. Suspicious Process: `net1.exe`**\n- A process named **`net1.exe`** (likely a typo or mimic of `net.exe`) is running the `user` command.\n  - **`net.exe`** is a legitimate Windows tool, but **`net1.exe`** is **not** a standard Windows executable. This could indicate **malware impersonating a legitimate process**.\n\n### **3. Credential Enumeration**\n- **`cmdkey.exe \/list`** is used to list stored credentials. While legitimate, its combination with the PowerShell enumeration commands suggests **attempts to gather credentials** (e.g., for pass-the-hash attacks).\n\n### **4. Unusual File Creation**\n- A file named **`pacote_ativo.txt`** is created in the user's Downloads directory via PowerShell. While not inherently malicious, **unusual file creation** in user directories could be part of **data exfiltration** or **malware persistence**.\n\n### **5. Security Group\/User Management Events**\n- Multiple events under **\"Security Group Management\"** and **\"User Account Management\"** (without clear process context) could indicate **tampering with permissions or user accounts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate the `net1.exe` process** for legitimacy (check file hashes, digital signatures, and origin).\n- **Audit PowerShell logs** for additional enumeration activities or command-line arguments.\n- **Monitor the `pacote_ativo.txt` file** for unexpected data modifications or exfiltration.\n- **Review user account and group changes** triggered by the \"Security Group Management\" events.\n- **Check for signs of privilege escalation** (e.g., elevated permissions used during enumeration).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **PowerShell-based enumeration**, **suspicious processes**, and **credential-related commands** raises **high suspicion of a reconnaissance or initial access attempt**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm or mitigate potential threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events here are about 'Security Group Management' under the winlog task. That seems normal, maybe related to group policy or user management. But then there are some other entries. Let me check those.\n\nLooking further, there's a process called SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Also, loading dlls from System32 might be okay, but sometimes malicious software uses legitimate dlls. However, the fact that it's being loaded by SDXHelper.exe could be a red flag. But I need more context.\n\nThen there's net.exe and net1.exe running 'localgroup' commands. Net.exe is a standard Windows tool for network commands, but net1.exe seems suspicious. Maybe a typo or a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate one. The command_line for net1.exe is 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1 localgroup'â€”that path is a bit off because the actual net.exe is in system32, but net1.exe isn't standard. That's a possible indicator of compromise.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files and modifying the registry. Creating files in user directories like AppData is common, but creating a file named 'modulo_base.txt' might be benign. However, the registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms. Also, the FileCreate events for winlogbeat.yml.new might be related to configuration changes, but if winlogbeat is being tampered with, that's a concern.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process is running with an installsource scheduler. That might be part of a legitimate update, but the command line includes scheduler, which could be part of a scheduled task. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The backgroundTaskHost.exe loading urlmon.dll is also something to note, but again, could be normal.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies: the presence of net1.exe instead of net.exe, SDXHelper.exe loading dlls, multiple registry changes by powershell, and file creations. Also, the repetition of some events like winlogbeat creating files might indicate someone trying to configure or tamper with the logging software.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several suspicious activities here. The non-standard processes, unexpected file creations, and registry modifications could indicate a potential security threat. However, some of these might be false positives. But given the combination of these events, it's worth investigating further. So, I think this batch is interesting and should be looked into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** repeatedly loads **`urlmon.dll`** and **`combase.dll`** from **`System32`**. While these are legitimate system DLLs, the use of **`SDXHelper.exe`** (a non-standard Windows process) raises concerns. This could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **malicious code injection** if the process is not legitimate.\n- **`net1.exe`** (not a standard Windows tool) executes the `localgroup` command. This resembles a **malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate tool** (e.g., `net.exe`), potentially used for **group manipulation or privilege escalation**.\n\n### **2. PowerShell Activity**\n- Multiple **`powershell.exe`** instances are involved in:\n  - **File creation** in user directories (e.g., `modulo_base.txt`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`). While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **data exfiltration** or **configuration tampering**.\n  - **Registry modifications** (e.g., `Registry value set`). This is a common technique for **persistence** or **disabling security controls**.\n\n### **3. Winlogbeat Tampering**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creates a `.yml.new` file in the **`Downloads`** directory. This might suggest **tampering with log collection tools**, potentially to **obfuscate malicious activity** or **exfiltrate logs**.\n\n### **4. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and BackgroundTaskHost.exe**\n- **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`** runs with the `\/installsource scheduler` flag, which could be part of a **scheduled task**. However, the presence of **`backgroundTaskHost.exe`** loading **`urlmon.dll`** (a browser-related DLL) is unusual and may indicate **unauthorized process execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some events (e.g., `Security Group Management`) are benign, the combination of **non-standard processes**, **PowerShell-based file\/registry manipulation**, and **potential tampering with logging tools** suggests **malicious activity** or **compromise**. Further investigation is recommended, including:\n- **Process integrity checks** (e.g., verifying digital signatures of `SDXHelper.exe`, `net1.exe`).\n- **Network traffic analysis** to detect data exfiltration.\n- **Registry and file system forensics** to identify persistence mechanisms or hidden payloads.\n\nThis batch is **highly suspicious** and merits immediate attention."}
