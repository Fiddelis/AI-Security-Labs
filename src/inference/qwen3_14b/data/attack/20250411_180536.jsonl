{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, right? So maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a line with process None and winlog task None. Hmm, that might be an error or incomplete data, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is common but sometimes used in attacks. But there's also whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to get user info. Not necessarily bad, but maybe part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command line that uses sc.exe to create a service with a path that seems a bit odd. The path includes \"modulo_geral.exe\" and \"unidade_base.exe\" which are not standard Windows files. That's suspicious. Also, the command line has a lot of spaces and equals signs that might be obfuscating the actual command.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events from services.exe and sc.exe. Services.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's modifying the registry in a way that's not typical, that could be a red flag. Also, sc.exe is used to manage services, so creating new services might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThe image loaded events show various DLLs from the .NET Framework, which is normal for applications that use .NET. However, the presence of multiple image loads from different .NET DLLs might indicate that some component is loading additional code, which could be malicious if not expected.\n\nPutting it all together: the normal browser activity is probably benign, but the unusual service creation via sc.exe with non-standard executable paths, along with multiple registry modifications and image loads from .NET DLLs, could indicate an attempt to install a backdoor or persistence mechanism. The combination of these events, especially the service creation and registry changes, suggests that this might be a malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. But the presence of suspicious service creation and registry events makes me lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Unusual service creation via sc.exe with non-standard executable paths (e.g., 'modulo_geral.exe'). 2) Frequent registry modifications by services.exe and sc.exe, which may indicate persistence mechanisms. 3) PowerShell and cmd.exe usage with potentially malicious command-line arguments. While some events (e.g., Chrome network activity) are normal, the combination of service creation, registry changes, and non-standard DLL loads raises concerns about potential malware installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its setup. Maybe the user is installing or configuring it.\n\nThen there are several entries about powershell.exe performing registry value sets and process accesses. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but these events alone aren't necessarily malicious. However, multiple registry changes and process accesses could be a sign of something more if they're part of a pattern.\n\nAnother entry mentions RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe doing registry value sets. RuntimeBroker is related to app containers, and Notepad is a standard application. These might be normal activities, but again, the context matters.\n\nThen there's an entry where calc.exe (calculator) loaded urlmon.dll from System32. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and is used for handling URLs. But why is the calculator loading it? That might be normal if it's part of some legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software can inject code into legitimate processes. However, just loading a standard DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere are also multiple svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. Svchost is a host process for Windows services. It's common for svchost to interact with the registry, but again, it's not inherently suspicious unless there's a pattern of unusual activity.\n\nLooking at all the events together, the main thing I notice is the repeated use of PowerShell for registry and process access. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, excessive or unusual activity could indicate a script or automated process. However, in this batch, there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior like file modifications, unauthorized access, or known malicious signatures. The file creation by winlogbeat seems legitimate, and the other events are typical system activities.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low because the events don't show clear signs of an attack. However, the repeated PowerShell activity might warrant further investigation, but not enough to classify this as interesting right now. So, I'd say it's not interesting, but the justification is that the events are mostly normal system activities without clear indicators of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal system operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration file creation, standard process activities like calc.exe and svchost.exe). No clear indicators of compromise, malicious file access, or anomalous behavior are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
