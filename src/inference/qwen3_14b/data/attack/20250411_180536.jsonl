{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal, right? Chrome often does that. But then there's a line with process None and winlog task None. Maybe that's just noise or an error in logging. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed, which is common but can also be used for malicious activities. The whoami.exe command is run, which is a legitimate tool but sometimes used in attacks to check user context. Then, looking at the cmd.exe entries, there's a command line that uses sc.exe to create a service with a long path. That seems suspicious. sc.exe is used to manage services, and creating a new service with a custom executable might be part of persistence mechanisms. The command line has \"sc.exe create elemento_principal= \"C:\\\\elemento_geral...\" which looks like it's trying to set up a service. Also, the path names are a bit odd with underscores and hyphens, which might be obfuscation.\n\nAnother entry has cmd.exe with a command line that includes \"sc.exe start modulo_comum\". Starting a service that was just created could be part of an attack. Then there's sc.exe creating another service called tarefa_principal with a path that seems similar. The use of sc.exe multiple times to create and start services is a red flag. Services are often used by malware to persist after reboot, so this could be an indicator of compromise.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are references to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a problem. However, since they're part of the standard .NET framework, it's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThe repeated registry value set events for services.exe and other processes might indicate changes to the registry, which is common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the service creation via sc.exe, it's more concerning.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed, which could be part of a script-based attack. The combination of these events—service creation, registry changes, and PowerShell activity—might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the creation of new services using sc.exe, the registry modifications, and the PowerShell activity are all signs that could be part of a malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like Chrome's network activity), the combination of these suspicious events makes this batch worth investigating further. Therefore, I think this is an interesting case for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several indicators that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity or system compromise. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Service Creation via `sc.exe`:**\n   - Multiple entries show **`cmd.exe`** executing **`sc.exe`** to create services with non-standard names (e.g., `elemento_principal`, `tarefa_base`) and paths that include obfuscated or unusual directory structures (e.g., `C:\\elemento_geral\\...`).\n   - Example command line:  \n     ```bash\n     sc.exe create elemento_principal= \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\...\"\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - Malware often uses `sc.exe` to create persistent services that execute malicious payloads on system startup.  \n     - The use of non-standard paths and obfuscated filenames may indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Repeated **`Registry value set`** events involving processes like **`cmd.exe`**, **`conhost.exe`**, and **`elemento_ativo.exe`**.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - Registry changes are common in malware for persistence, configuration, or disabling security tools. The lack of context (e.g., no clear purpose) raises concerns.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple **`powershell.exe`** entries with **`Image loaded`** events.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - PowerShell is frequently abused by attackers for executing scripts or downloading payloads. While not inherently malicious, its presence alongside other suspicious events is concerning.\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loads:**\n   - **`.NET`-related DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded by processes like **`estrutura_principal.exe`** and **`tarefa_logico.exe`**.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - While these are legitimate .NET components, their loading by non-standard executables may indicate exploitation of .NET frameworks or injection techniques.\n\n5. **Unusual Process Names:**\n   - Processes like **`modulo_secundario.exe`**, **`objeto_logico.exe`**, and **`estrutura_principal.exe`** have names that deviate from standard Windows or application binaries.  \n   - **Why this is suspicious:**  \n     - Malware often uses obfuscated or nonsensical filenames to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity:**\n- **Legitimate:**  \n  - Chrome's DNS queries and network connections are normal.  \n  - `whoami.exe` is a standard tool for checking user context.  \n  - `.NET` DLLs are part of the Windows framework and may be loaded by legitimate applications.\n\n- **Suspicious:**  \n  - The combination of **service creation**, **registry changes**, **PowerShell activity**, and **non-standard process names** suggests a potential attack chain (e.g., initial exploitation → persistence → execution).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events **requires further investigation** due to the presence of **multiple red flags** (service creation, registry modifications, PowerShell activity, and unusual process behavior). While some events are benign, the **contextual clustering of suspicious actions** indicates a high likelihood of **malicious activity** or **system compromise**.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**  \n- Check the **integrity** of the files referenced in the service creation commands (e.g., `elemento_principal.exe`).  \n- Analyze **PowerShell logs** for script content or network connections.  \n- Use **EDR\/XDR tools** to correlate these events with file behavior, network traffic, and user activity.  \n- Investigate the **registry changes** for signs of persistence or tampering.  \n\nThis is a **high-priority alert** for further forensic analysis."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its setup. Maybe the user is just installing or configuring it.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe with tasks like Registry value set and Process accessed. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. However, just having these events isn't necessarily bad. The next events include RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values. These are common system processes, so their actions might be normal. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also standard applications, so their involvement here doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file paths, the only non-system paths are the winlogbeat configuration file in the user's Downloads folder. The other files mentioned are system files like urlmon.dll, which is part of Windows. The Image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal since it's a legitimate system component.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unexpected process creation, or suspicious file modifications. The events seem to be part of normal system operations or software installation. Even though PowerShell is involved, without additional context like command-line arguments or unusual registry changes, it's hard to classify this as malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch doesn't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. The activities are consistent with typical system and user actions. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations and software installation activities. Winlogbeat configuration file creation, PowerShell registry interactions, and standard process operations (e.g., calc.exe, notepad.exe) are consistent with typical user behavior and legitimate system functionality. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\"\n}"}
