Chrome doing registry value sets might be normal, but maybe not. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is usually used to get the current user's identity. That's not inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger attack, it could be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe command that copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's interesting because sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys utility. Replacing it with a backup file could be part of a malicious replacement, like a backdoor. Then there's another cmd.exe command using schtasks to delete a task named win32times. Deleting a scheduled task might be normal, but if the task was malicious, that's a sign of cleanup.\n\nAlso, schtasks.exe is executed with the same command, which is deleting the task. That's consistent with the previous cmd command. The image loaded event for taskschd.dll is normal, but combined with the other actions, it might be part of a larger scheme.\n\nThere are multiple instances of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe.

The user might be trying to replace system files and remove traces by deleting scheduled tasks.\n\nI need to check if these events are part of a known attack pattern. Replacing sethc.exe is a classic technique used in some malware to create a backdoor. Deleting a scheduled task could be part of covering tracks.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nLooking at the files, there's a mention of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll being loaded by chrome.exe. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading it, that might be normal. But MpOAV.dll is also part of Windows Defender, so maybe that's okay too. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe performing actions. There's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to testing script execution policies. But creating a script in the Temp folder could be suspicious if it's part of an attack, like executing malicious code. However, if it's a legitimate test, maybe not. But without more context, this could be a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events from cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings. If these changes are unauthorized, that's a problem. But again, without knowing the specific changes, it's hard to say. \n\nThe command line for one of the whoami.exe processes is shown, which is normal for checking user identity. But the repeated use of powershell.exe with Process accessed and Registry events might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. \n\nAnother thing is the Image loaded events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so if powershell.exe is loading them, it's probably normal. But if there's an unexpected version or path, that could be an issue. However, the paths here seem legitimate.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of a temporary script file created by powershell.exe, along with multiple registry modifications and process accesses, might indicate malicious activity. However, some of these events could be legitimate.

That's a common place for malware to hide, but deleting a script might be part of cleanup. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be normal operations, but the repetition could be a red flag.

But then there's a pipe created event and some image loaded events. The image loaded is for Windows Defender's MpClient.dll, which is normal.\n\nThen, there are multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of various .bat files in different paths. The paths have some odd directory structures with \"..\\\" which might indicate trying to access parent directories.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes. The first event shows a command line that checks if a certain file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That's a common script, maybe checking for a file's presence. But then there are several \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events. The image loaded events mention .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell when running scripts, especially if they're using .NET assemblies. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting files temporarily might be part of malicious activity, like dropping a payload.\n\nWait, but the file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest... which sounds like a legitimate PowerShell script, maybe part of a policy test. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted might be normal, but sometimes malware does similar things. Then there's another file created in Downloads with elemento_padrao.txt. Not sure what that's for, but maybe benign.\n\nThen there are Chrome.exe events with registry value sets. Multiple registry changes could indicate something, but Chrome might be doing normal operations. However, if there are a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. But the user didn't specify the nature of the changes, just that they're set.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event for PowerShell, which could be used for inter-process communication, which is normal but sometimes used in attacks. The other events are Engine Lifecycle, which might be related to PowerShell's execution.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the PowerShell scripts are checking paths like C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo... which might be part of a legitimate application, but the paths are a bit generic. The fact that multiple similar checks are done might indicate automated scripts, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, loading .NET DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and registry changes might be more indicative of something suspicious. Especially if the user is not expecting such activity. But I need to check if these are common behaviors. PowerShell is often used by malware, but it's also a legitimate tool. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be normal, but if there's an attempt to bypass defenses, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the first event's command line is checking for a specific batch file. If that file isn't present, it exits with 1. Maybe that's part of a setup or installation process. But if the scripts are part of a legitimate application, then it's okay. However, the repetition of similar scripts with different paths might suggest that someone is trying to execute multiple checks, possibly to see if certain files exist before proceeding with an action.\n\nAnother point: the file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles. If a profile is being created, it could be a sign of persistence mechanisms, which is a red flag. But again, it depends on the context. If the user is an admin and this is part of their setup, it's normal. Otherwise, it might be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several indicators that could be benign, but the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, temporary file creation, registry changes, and possibly profile modifications might warrant further investigation. It's not conclusive, but enough to flag as potentially interesting for a security analyst to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Behavior:**\n   - **File Existence Checks:** Multiple PowerShell commands check for the existence of `.bat` files (e.g., `Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\...\"`) and exit with `0` or `1`. While this is common in automation\/scripts, the repetition of similar patterns across different paths (e.g., `modulo_ativo`, `modulo_logico`) may indicate a systematic check for specific files, possibly part of a larger process or malicious reconnaissance.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is created in the **Temp directory** and subsequently deleted. While this could be a legitimate script testing or cleanup, the transient nature of such files is often exploited by malware to avoid detection.\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell processes load **Windows Defender DLLs** (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) and standard .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). This is typical for PowerShell scripts using .NET, but the presence of Defender DLLs might indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass security mechanisms (e.g., checking Defender status).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Chrome.exe** triggers multiple **registry value set** events. While Chrome may legitimately modify registry keys (e.g., for updates or settings), the volume and lack of context (e.g., specific keys modified) could hint at tampering or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation and Persistence:**\n   - A **Pipe Created** event for PowerShell may indicate inter-process communication, which is normal but could be abused in attacks. Additionally, the creation of a file in the **StartupProfileData** directory (a known PowerShell profile location) might suggest an attempt to establish persistence (e.g., modifying a profile script).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Benign Possibilities:** \n  - Legitimate scripting, system configuration, or software deployment.\n  - Temporary files and registry changes may be part of a standard workflow or testing process.\n- **Suspicious Indicators:**\n  - **Transitory file creation\/deletion** and **repetitive path checks** could signal attempts to execute payloads or probe the system.\n  - **Windows Defender DLL loading** in conjunction with PowerShell might indicate evasion techniques or interaction with security tools.\n  - **Unusual registry activity** (especially if not tied to known Chrome operations) could point to unauthorized changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:** \n   - Check for additional **network activity**, **file modifications**, or **user behavior** (e.g., admin privileges, unusual login times) that might contextualize these events.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Inspect the full command lines (e.g., `Test-Path` paths) for obfuscation or references to suspicious directories.\n3. **Monitor for Persistence:**\n   - Investigate the **StartupProfileData** file for potential malicious scripts or modifications to PowerShell profiles.\n4. **Check Defender Logs:**\n   - Review Windows Defender logs for any detection or interaction with the loaded DLLs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **normal PowerShell behavior** but include **potential red flags** (e.g., temporary file handling, registry changes, and repetitive checks). While not definitively malicious, **further investigation** is recommended to rule out adversarial activity or misconfigurations."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly about PowerShell.exe activities. My job is to figure out if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several instances of 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create' tasks. But the key thing here is the command_line in one of the entries. The third event has a command_line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create and modify batch files. The paths here are a bit odd, with things like '..\\pacote_base' which might be trying to navigate directories. That could be a red flag because using '..' might indicate an attempt to access parent directories, possibly for evasion.\n\nThen, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET framework, which is normal for PowerShell. But there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be benign, but it's worth noting. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to create and modify scripts in various paths could be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the other command_line entries, they all follow a similar pattern: creating a new item (a file) and then setting content to a batch file with 'dir' as the value. The paths are different each time, but the structure is the same. This repetition might indicate automated or scripted behavior, which could be part of an attack, like deploying malicious scripts or trying to establish persistence.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks don't immediately ring alarm bells, but combined with the file creation and registry changes, it's a mix of normal and potentially malicious activities. However, the main concern here is the use of PowerShell for creating and modifying files in a way that could be part of a larger attack, such as setting up backdoors or executing commands. \n\nAlso, the fact that multiple events involve PowerShell modifying the registry and loading images might suggest that the process is trying to alter system settings or inject code. While some of these activities are normal, the combination and the repetitive nature of the file creations make me think this is worth investigating further. \n\nI should check if there are any known patterns of abuse with these activities. Creating temporary files in AppData\\Local\\Temp is common, but the other paths are more scattered. The use of '..' in paths might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual location. \n\nOverall, while not all activities are malicious, the combination of registry changes, repeated file creation with PowerShell, and the use of potentially obfuscated paths suggests this is a suspicious batch that should be investigated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) executing commands to:\n     - **Create files** using `New-Item` in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`).\n     - **Modify files** with `Set-Content` to write batch scripts containing `dir` (e.g., `C:\\...\\<random-path>\\modulo_base_script.bat`).\n   - **Pattern**: The scripts use obfuscated or nested paths (e.g., `..\\pacote_base`, `..\\modulo_base`) to potentially evade detection or access sensitive directories.\n\n2. **Unusual File Creation**:\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) is created in the user's `Temp` directory. While temporary files are normal, the filename suggests **script policy testing**, which could indicate:\n     - **Bypassing execution policies** (e.g., `Bypass` mode).\n     - **Malicious script deployment** disguised as legitimate testing.\n\n3. **Registry and Image Loading**:\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** and **`Image loaded`** events (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender) suggest potential **registry manipulation** or **DLL injection**, which could be part of:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying registry keys to re-launch malicious processes).\n     - **Tampering with security tools** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` is part of Windows Defender; loading it might be a red herring or an attempt to bypass detection).\n\n4. **Lateral Movement or Data Exfiltration**:\n   - The repetitive creation of scripts in diverse directories (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\modulo_secundario`, `C:\\estrutura_base\\objeto_logico`) could indicate **automated deployment** of payloads across the system or network.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n- **PowerShell abuse** is a common technique in **post-exploitation phases** of attacks (e.g., establishing persistence, executing commands, or exfiltrating data).\n- The **obfuscated paths** and **scripting patterns** resemble tactics used in **malware campaigns** (e.g., **Emotet**, **Cobalt Strike**) to evade detection.\n- The **presence of Windows Defender-related DLLs** might indicate an attempt to **interfere with security monitoring**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps**\n1. **Check the contents of the created files** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`) for malicious code.\n2. **Analyze the registry changes** for unauthorized modifications (e.g., `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n3. **Monitor network traffic** for data exfiltration or communication with C2 servers.\n4. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., process creation, file access) to determine the scope of the activity.\n5. **Investigate user activity** (e.g., `fiddelis`) for anomalous behavior or unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs contains **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malicious activity** (e.g., script deployment, registry tampering). Immediate investigation is recommended to determine if this is part of a **malware infection**, **privilege escalation**, or **lateral movement**."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is involved in a File Delete event. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. But deleting a script might be normal, but maybe not always. Let's check others.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but not inherently malicious. Then, a File Created event with a .bat file in a seemingly arbitrary path. That's a red flag because creating executable files in non-standard locations can be part of an attack.\n\nLooking at the command_line in one of the entries: New-Item is used to create a .bat file, then Set-Content writes \"dir\" into another .bat. That seems benign, but the paths are a bit odd with multiple directory jumps (like ..\\\\). Maybe trying to obfuscate the path?\n\nThen, several Image Loaded events pointing to legitimate system files like MpClient.dll (Windows Defender) and .NET framework DLLs. Those are normal, so probably not malicious.\n\nHowever, there are multiple File Created events for .bat files in various directories. Also, the command lines involve checking if certain .bat files exist, which might be part of a setup or deployment. But the fact that so many .bat files are being created in different locations could indicate something is trying to establish persistence or execute commands.\n\nAlso, the use of PowerShell with command-line scripts that create and modify files might be part of a larger attack. The combination of file creation, deletion, and registry changes (though registry events here don't have details) could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the sheer number of file operations and the use of PowerShell, which is often abused for malicious purposes, makes this batch interesting.

While some operations (e.g., Windows Defender DLLs) are legitimate, the combination of these behaviors raises concerns.\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a PowerShell command that checks if a specific batch file exists and exits with 0 or 1. Similar patterns repeat in other entries, with different file paths each time. The paths mentioned are like \"C:\\\\modulo_geral\\\\estrutura_geral\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat\" and others. The use of \"..\" in the paths might be a red flag. That could indicate that the script is trying to navigate up directories, possibly to access files in parent directories, which might be part of a path traversal attack or trying to find files in unexpected locations.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing similar commands, each checking for a different file. This could be part of a reconnaissance phase where the attacker is checking for the presence of certain files to determine the environment or to find potential targets. The repetition of such commands might suggest automated probing.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which is normal for temporary files, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of a larger operation. Also, the presence of events related to registry value sets and process accesses could indicate attempts to modify system settings or interact with other processes, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show actual file modifications, execution of malicious code, or network activity. They are all checks and temporary file operations. The classification depends on whether these activities are out of the ordinary. If the system normally has a lot of PowerShell activity, this might not be interesting. But if this is unusual, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nConsidering that the same command structure is repeated with different paths, and the use of relative paths, this might be a technique used by attackers to check for the presence of files in various locations. This could be part of a dropper or a way to locate configuration files. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But given the repetitive nature and the use of path traversal, it's worth flagging as potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** Potentially Interesting (Requires Further Investigation)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Commands with Path Traversal:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands like `Test-Path` with paths containing `..` (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral..\\elemento_auxiliar\\componente_secundario_script.bat`). This suggests **path traversal attempts** to check for files in parent directories, which could indicate:\n     - **Reconnaissance** (probing for sensitive files or misconfigurations).\n     - **Malicious intent** (e.g., checking for the presence of tools, configuration files, or exploit targets).\n\n2. **Consistent Command Structure:**\n   - The repeated use of `if (Test-Path \"PATH\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }` across 15+ entries implies **automated probing**. This pattern is often seen in:\n     - **Payload delivery** (e.g., checking for prerequisites before executing malicious code).\n     - **Environment enumeration** (identifying system-specific files or directories).\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Malicious Activity:**\n   - No events show actual file modifications, execution of malicious payloads, or network communication. The activities are limited to:\n     - File existence checks.\n     - Temporary file creation\/deletion (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`).\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - **Normal vs. Abnormal Behavior:** If the system typically has high PowerShell usage (e.g., DevOps, scripting), this might be benign. However, the **repetition and path traversal** are unusual for routine operations.\n   - **Indicator of Compromise (IoC):** The pattern resembles techniques used by malware (e.g., **PowerShell-based droppers** or **reconnaissance modules**).\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for associated events (e.g., network connections, registry changes, process injections).\n   - **Analyze File Paths:** Investigate if the probed files (e.g., `entrada_base.exe`, `tarefa_ativo.exe`) exist and their legitimacy.\n   - **Monitor User Behavior:** Determine if the activities align with authorized user actions or if they originate from unexpected accounts.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the **repetitive path traversal and PowerShell-based probing** warrant further investigation. This could indicate **initial reconnaissance** or **preparation for a larger attack**."}

Those are legitimate, but loading them might be normal for PowerShell scripts. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could be a red flag if they're loading unexpected or unknown DLLs. But in this case, the paths seem to be standard system files.\n\nThere's a File created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in some scripts, but could be part of a cleanup process. However, if the file is being created and deleted quickly, it might be hiding something. But without seeing the content of the file, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows a Pipe Created, which might be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but could be part of a more complex attack.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking for the existence of specific files (like componente_secundario.exe, entrada_auxiliar.exe). These files aren't present, so the scripts exit with 1. Maybe these are part of a setup that's not fully installed, but could also be checking for the presence of malicious files. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe cmd.exe process is checking if a file exists in the temp directory, similar to the PowerShell scripts. Again, common for scripts but could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The repeated use of PowerShell to check for files, the loading of various DLLs, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files might indicate some automated script or tool. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity like downloading payloads, modifying system settings, or interacting with external networks. The justification for being interesting would be if there's a pattern that's unusual or indicative of an attack. But in this case, the activities seem to be benign scripts checking file existence and using standard system tools. Unless there's a known malicious pattern here that I'm missing, it might not be interesting for investigation. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for files could be a sign of something more, especially if these are part of a larger attack chain. But without more data, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the answer is that it's not particularly suspicious, but the user might need to look deeper into the files being checked or the context in which these commands are run.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries consist of routine system activities involving PowerShell, CMD, and Windows Defender components. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting:**\n   - Multiple instances of PowerShell scripts checking for file existence (e.g., `Test-Path`) using commands like:\n     ```powershell\n     IF EXIST %temp%\\\\objeto_logico.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )\n     ```\n     These are **benign** checks, commonly used in scripts for conditional logic or validation.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Components:**\n   - **Image Load Events** involve standard system DLLs (e.g., `MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender) and .NET framework components. These are **expected** during PowerShell execution.\n\n3. **File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - Temporary files (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) are created and deleted. This is **normal behavior** for scripts that generate temporary artifacts or clean up after execution.\n\n4. **Process Activity:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** are used for standard system tasks (e.g., identity checks, file existence verification). No signs of anomalous behavior.\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Absence of):**\n- **No evidence of malicious payloads** (e.g., downloading files, network communication, registry modifications beyond routine checks).\n- **No suspicious file paths** or unexpected DLLs loaded.\n- **No persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks) indicated.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **not suspicious** and aligns with typical system and scripting operations. The repeated file existence checks and temporary file usage are **harmless** in this context. Further investigation would require additional context (e.g., file contents, network activity, user behavior) to identify potential threats. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided data."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are about processes being accessed, specifically powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and whoami.exe. There are several instances of 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But what stands out here?\n\nLooking closer, there's a command_line entry for PowerShell that checks if certain files exist. The commands are using Test-Path to check for specific .cs files in various directories. These paths look suspicious because they have a pattern: C:\\ followed by some folder structure and ending with .cs files. The names like \"estrutura_auxiliar\" or \"elemento_base\" don't immediately ring a bell as standard system files. \n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of these checks. The fact that the same command is repeated with different paths might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for the presence of certain files, possibly looking for vulnerabilities or trying to determine the environment. \n\nAnother thing is the Image Load events. PowerShell is loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. But combined with the other events, maybe there's something else going on.\n\nWait, there's a 'Registry value set' event for PowerShell. That might be part of persistence mechanisms. But the main thing here is the repeated Test-Path commands. Those could be part of a script that's checking for specific files, maybe to see if certain conditions are met before proceeding with malicious activities. \n\nAlso, the command lines are structured in a way that if the file exists, it exits with 0, else 1. That's a common technique in scripts to check for the presence of files. If this is part of a larger script, maybe the next steps depend on whether these files are found. \n\nBut are these paths legitimate? The directories mentioned like \"modulo_secundario\" or \"tarefa_logico\" don't seem like standard Windows directories. The .cs files are C# source files, which might be part of a custom application, but in a typical Windows environment, you wouldn't expect to see such files in those locations. \n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of specific .cs files in non-standard directories. That's unusual and could indicate reconnaissance or preparation for a more complex attack. The repetition of similar commands across different paths suggests a systematic check. \n\nEven though there's no direct evidence of malware here, the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The combination of these events could be part of a larger attack chain, such as checking for the presence of a backdoor or a specific configuration file. \n\nSo, the answer is yes, this batch is interesting because the pattern of checking for specific files in non-standard locations with PowerShell is indicative of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### 1. **Repetitive PowerShell `Test-Path` Checks for Specific `.cs` Files**\n   - Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.cs` (C# source code) files in non-standard, deeply nested directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\unidade_secundario.cs`).\n   - **Why this is suspicious**:\n     - These paths are not typical for legitimate Windows operations or standard software.\n     - The structured repetition of similar commands (e.g., checking for `*.cs` files in different directories) suggests **systematic reconnaissance** or probing for specific files, possibly to determine the presence of custom applications, backdoors, or configuration files.\n     - The use of `.cs` files in such contexts is unusual unless explicitly part of a known, legitimate development workflow (which is not indicated here).\n\n### 2. **Unusual File Paths**\n   - The directories and filenames (e.g., `modulo_secundario`, `estrutura_auxiliar`, `elemento_base`) lack clear semantic meaning and do not align with standard Windows or application-specific naming conventions.\n   - This could indicate **custom or obfuscated file structures**, potentially tied to malicious activity (e.g., hiding payloads, obfuscating attack paths, or interacting with non-standard tools).\n\n### 3. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**\n   - While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the combination of:\n     - Repeated `Test-Path` checks.\n     - Non-standard file paths.\n     - Absence of clear context (e.g., no mention of development tools, scripts, or user-initiated actions).\n   - Raises concerns about **potential reconnaissance, persistence, or preconditions for further malicious activity**.\n\n### 4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**\n   - Some PowerShell commands are logged under the `Provider Lifecycle` event type, which may relate to PowerShell providers (e.g., file system, registry). While this is not inherently malicious, the lack of context makes it harder to determine legitimacy.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe events exhibit **behavior consistent with malicious reconnaissance** (e.g., probing for specific files to identify system vulnerabilities, check for existing tools, or determine environmental conditions). While not definitive proof of compromise, this pattern warrants further investigation, such as:\n- Analyzing the full command-line context and user\/origin details.\n- Checking for associated files or processes that might indicate a larger attack chain.\n- Correlating with other logs (e.g., network activity, registry changes) to confirm benign or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The main thing here is that I have to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the logs. A lot of them involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete, Pipe Created, Registry value set, Process accessed, etc. Some of the file paths are in temporary directories like AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for legitimate scripts, but sometimes malicious stuff uses that too.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if a certain file exists, like Test-Path with paths that include \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". That script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" might be related to keylogging, which is a malicious activity. However, the commands are just checking if the file exists and exiting 0 or 1, not actually executing the script. So maybe the attacker is probing for the presence of that script, perhaps to see if it's already there or to prepare for deployment.\n\nAnother thing is that some of the files being accessed are related to Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate files, so seeing them loaded might be normal. However, if there's a lot of activity around them, it might be a red flag, but here it's just a couple of ImageLoad events.\n\nThe user also ran whoami.exe, which is a normal command to check the current user, so that's probably benign.\n\nNow, the key points here are the repeated checks for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in various paths. Even though the scripts aren't being executed, the fact that the system is being probed for these files could indicate reconnaissance. The attacker might be checking if certain malicious scripts are present, maybe to determine if they can proceed with their attack or to see if defenses are in place.\n\nHowever, the logs don't show any actual execution of the keystroke scripts, just checking their existence. Without more context, like actual execution or other malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of these checks, combined with PowerShell's use (which is often abused in attacks), might be enough to flag this as suspicious.\n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The system might be under attack, or at least being probed. Therefore, the answer should be that it's interesting, possibly indicating malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Probing for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" Scripts**:  \n   Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of files named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across various directories (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_comum\\...`, `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`). While the scripts are not executed (only existence checks are performed), the repeated probing for such files is highly unusual. The name \"Get-Keystrokes\" strongly implies a potential keylogging payload, which is a common malicious technique.\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage**:  \n   PowerShell is a frequent tool for attackers due to its scripting capabilities and deep system integration. While legitimate, the volume and nature of these commands (e.g., checking for suspicious scripts) raise concerns about reconnaissance or preparation for exploitation.\n\n3. **Temporary File Activity**:  \n   Files created in temporary directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp`) are common in both legitimate and malicious contexts. However, combined with the probing for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, this could indicate an attempt to deploy or test malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**:  \n   The logs do not include evidence of benign activity (e.g., user-initiated scripts, system updates) that might justify the observed behavior. The absence of context makes the activity appear anomalous.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe logs are **interesting** and merit further investigation. The repetitive probing for suspicious scripts, combined with PowerShell activity, suggests potential reconnaissance or preparation for malicious actions. While no direct execution of malicious payloads is observed, the patterns are consistent with adversarial behavior."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe, which is normal, but I should check for any unusual activity. There are several ImageLoad events for files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably okay. But then there's an entry for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal too, but I should note it.\n\nLooking further, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1, and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers create temporary files to execute malicious code. However, the fact that it's deleted afterward might be a red flag. But I need to check if there's any execution of that script.\n\nThen there are some PowerShell commands checking if certain paths exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 might be suspicious because that's a script that could capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. However, the commands are just checking if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's trying to determine if the file is present, maybe to avoid running it if it's already there? Not sure yet.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate event for a winlogbeat configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably part of legitimate monitoring. But the user might be using it, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nOther events include ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent for PowerShell and other processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe. The ImageLoad for urlmon.dll in Calculator.exe is normal since urlmon is part of Internet Explorer, but Calculator.exe is a standard app. However, the presence of Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll might be okay if it's part of some feature, but it's worth checking if that's normal behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the command lines for PowerShell: the first one checks if Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in C:\\tarefa_temporario... and exits 0 or 1. The second one does the same in C:\\unidade_logico... The names of the directories are a bit generic, but the script name is suspicious. If these scripts are not part of the system's legitimate files, that's a problem. However, the commands themselves don't execute the script, just check for its existence. So maybe that's part of a larger attack, like checking if a certain file is present before proceeding, or perhaps it's a red herring.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell and other processes. That's common, but if there's a lot of access to processes that's not typical, it could be an indicator of compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal, just checking the user. Notepad.exe and svchost.exe registry changes might be part of normal operations, but again, if there's a lot of registry changes, that's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script. Even though the commands are just checking for its existence, the name suggests it could be used for keylogging. However, without seeing the actual content of the script or more actions taken, it's hard to say for sure. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of a larger attack, but in isolation, it's not conclusive. Other events seem to be normal system activity. So, I would lean towards this being a potential indicator of malicious activity, but more investigation is needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of key observations and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **`Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script References**:\n   - PowerShell commands check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in directories like `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\...` and `C:\\unidade_logico\\...`. \n   - **Why this is concerning**: The script name strongly suggests **keylogging capabilities** (common in malware). While the commands only check for the file's presence (not execution), the context could imply **preparation for malicious activity** (e.g., verifying file presence before deployment).\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. \n   - **Why this is concerning**: This pattern is often used to **execute malicious code in memory** (e.g., via `Invoke-Expression` or `PowerShell -EncodedCommand`) to avoid leaving persistent files on disk.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` entries for PowerShell suggest **active interaction with system processes and registry**, which could be part of **privilege escalation** or **payload delivery**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **.NET Framework and Windows Defender Files**: \n  - ImageLoad events for `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) are **normal** and part of standard system operations.\n- **Winlogbeat Configuration File**:\n  - The creation of a `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file is **legitimate** if the user is configuring a log shipper (e.g., for monitoring).\n- **Standard Applications**:\n  - `calc.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `svchost.exe` registry changes are **common** and not inherently malicious unless correlated with other suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **File Path Anomalies**: \n  - The use of non-standard directory names (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\...`) may indicate **custom attack paths**.\n- **Lack of Context**:\n  - The absence of execution logs for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` or the temporary script leaves **ambiguity**—it could be benign (e.g., a test script) or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**:\n   - Check if the script exists in the referenced paths and analyze its content for malicious payloads.\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Enable logging for PowerShell script execution (`LogPipelineExecutionDetails` and `Transcripting`) to detect hidden activity.\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for **network traffic** or **process execution** tied to the temporary script or `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`.\n4. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate if the attacker has created **scheduled tasks**, **registry keys**, or **startup entries** to maintain access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is legitimate, the presence of **`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**, **temporary script creation\/deletion**, and **frequent PowerShell interactions** raises **red flags**. This warrants further investigation to determine if the system is compromised. **Not conclusive**, but **highly suspicious**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's part of the normal installation process, maybe. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. But accessing a process isn't necessarily bad. \n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to get user info. But then there's a lot of network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making a lot of network connections could be normal, but maybe if it's connecting to suspicious IPs? However, the logs don't mention any specific destinations. \n\nWait, the key part might be the PowerShell events. There's a PowerShell process that's loading several DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. But then there's an entry where PowerShell is executing a command with \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse\". That's just listing files recursively, which could be part of a script, but not necessarily malicious. \n\nBut wait, looking at the command_line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's using \"& {ls -recurse; get-childitem -recurse; gci -recurse}\". That's just a series of commands to list files. Not sure why that's suspicious. However, there are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and modifying registry values. \n\nWait, the first event is the creation of a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's part of its normal operation. But maybe if that file was created in an unusual place or by an unexpected process? Here, it's under the user's Downloads directory, which might be normal if the user is installing it. \n\nBut then there's the PowerShell process that's loading several DLLs. The paths mentioned are all standard system files, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal for PowerShell to load them. However, the Windows Defender DLL (MpOAV.dll) is also loaded, which might be part of a legitimate process. \n\nBut the repetition of PowerShell accessing processes and registry events might indicate some automated script or tool. However, without more context, like unusual commands or connections to suspicious domains, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. The key point here is that there's a combination of events. The first event is a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is normal. Then, multiple PowerShell processes accessing and modifying things, but the commands are standard. The network connections from Chrome and svchost.exe are common. \n\nBut maybe the fact that there's a new file created by winlogbeat, and then a lot of PowerShell activity. However, winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, and PowerShell is a common administrative tool. Unless there's something else. \n\nWait, the user might be trying to trick me into thinking that PowerShell is doing something malicious, but the commands are just listing files. Unless there's an indicator of compromise here. But I don't see any obvious signs like downloading malicious files, connecting to bad IPs, or executing suspicious commands. \n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of normal operations: installing winlogbeat, using PowerShell for file listing, and normal network activity. Therefore, maybe it's not interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the multiple PowerShell events and image loads are worth investigating. \n\nBut without more context, like the presence of malicious files or unexpected network destinations, it's hard to label this as interesting. So, I think the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of malicious activity in the logs provided.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of normal system activities and benign operations. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat File Creation**: The creation of `winlogbeat.yml.new` in the user's Downloads directory is consistent with the installation or configuration of Winlogbeat, a legitimate log-shipping tool. No suspicious behavior is evident here.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple PowerShell events include:\n   - **Image Loads**: Loading standard system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`)—these are part of the .NET runtime and Windows Defender, indicating normal operations.\n   - **Command Execution**: The use of `ls -recurse` and `get-childitem -recurse` is a standard file-listing operation, not inherently malicious.\n   - **Registry Access**: While registry modifications can sometimes indicate compromise, the logs do not specify suspicious changes or unauthorized keys.\n\n3. **Network Activity**: Chrome and `svchost.exe` making network connections are typical for browser activity and system services. No malicious destinations or unusual patterns are noted.\n\n4. **No Indicators of Compromise**: There is no evidence of:\n   - Malicious file downloads or execution.\n   - Unusual network destinations.\n   - Privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n   - Anomalous user behavior or unexpected process interactions.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events described are consistent with legitimate system operations, such as software installation, routine file management, and standard system service activity. **No clear signs of malicious activity** are present in the logs. \n\n**Answer**: `NOT INTERESTING`"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each line and look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nThe first two events involve PowerShell creating and then deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up. But then there's a Pipe Created event, which might be normal, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several events with the same command line: ls -recurse, get-childitem, etc. This looks like someone is listing files recursively, which could be part of exploring the file system.
