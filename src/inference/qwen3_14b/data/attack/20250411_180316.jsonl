{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking through the entries, most of them are about processes performing various actions like setting registry values, accessing processes, loading images, and creating files. The processes involved are common ones like notepad.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, and others. However, there are a few things that stand out.\n\nFirst, there's the 'cmd.exe' process with a command line that includes \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That looks suspicious because using WMIC to delete a process might be part of an attempt to terminate a process that's being monitored or is a security tool. Also, the command is using redirection to suppress output, which is often done to hide the activity.\n\nThen there's the 'WMIC.exe' entries. The command line here is \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\", which is the same as the one in cmd.exe. But also, the image loaded events for WMIC.exe point to urlmon.dll, ase.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These DLLs are part of Windows' own components, but loading them from a process that's being used for deletion might be a red flag. Especially since MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender, which could be a target for attackers trying to disable it.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'powershell.exe' multiple times with ProcessAccess events. While PowerShell is a normal tool, frequent access events could indicate someone is trying to manipulate processes or execute commands. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' event shows a file created in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file there might be normal if it's part of setup, but if it's unexpected, it could be an indicator of someone trying to install or configure a tool for data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the 'Calculator.exe' entries, they are loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a standard app, but loading a DLL that's typically used for web-related tasks might be unusual. However, urlmon.dll is a legitimate component, so this might not be a direct threat unless there's other suspicious behavior.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is also present, which is a standard tool for checking user context. That alone isn't suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious activities are the use of WMIC to delete processes, especially notepad.exe, which could be a way to remove evidence or disable monitoring. The loading of certain DLLs by WMIC and the presence of command-line arguments that suppress output are indicators of potential malicious activity. However, some of these events could be part of normal operations if, for example, the user is managing processes or testing the system. But given the combination of these events, especially the deletion command and the loading of DLLs, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these processes are common, but the specific commands and the suppression of output are red flags.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Deletion of Processes via WMIC**:\n   - **`cmd.exe`** and **`WMIC.exe`** executed commands to delete **`notepad.exe`** using:\n     ```\n     wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\n     ```\n     This is **unusual** because:\n     - `notepad.exe` is a legitimate process, but its deletion could be an attempt to **remove evidence** (e.g., a monitoring tool or log file).\n     - The use of `wmic` for process deletion is rare in normal operations and often associated with **malicious activity** (e.g., disabling security tools or hiding malicious processes).\n\n2. **Suppressed Output**:\n   - The `cmd.exe` command includes output redirection (`>`) to suppress logs, which is a **common tactic** to hide malicious activity.\n\n3. **Loading of Sensitive DLLs**:\n   - **`WMIC.exe`** loaded **`MpOAV.dll`** (part of Windows Defender) and **`urlmon.dll`** (used for web-related tasks). While these are legitimate DLLs, their loading by `WMIC.exe` (a tool often abused in attacks) raises concerns about **DLL hijacking** or **tampering with security components**.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - **`conhost.exe`** and **`chrome.exe`** were involved in **registry modifications** (`Registry value set`), which could indicate **configuration changes** or **attempts to bypass security controls**.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious Elements**\n- **Common processes** like `notepad.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are present, which is normal in most environments.\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a configuration file is expected if the tool is being actively used for log shipping.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **process deletion via WMIC**, **suppressed output**, and **loading of sensitive DLLs** suggests **potential malicious activity** (e.g., disabling security tools or covering tracks). While some events are routine, the **specific patterns here** are red flags and **warrant deeper investigation** (e.g., checking for unauthorized changes to system processes, analyzing network traffic, or inspecting the `winlogbeat` configuration file). \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** (confidence: medium-high)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity. Chrome is common, but PowerShell is often used by attackers. But I need to check for specific commands or unusual behavior.\n\nWait, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is replacing the sethc.exe file, which is the Sticky Keys utility. Attackers often replace this with a malicious payload. That's a red flag right there.\n\nAnother entry has \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". Schtasks is used to manage scheduled tasks. Deleting a task might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like creating a malicious task, that's suspicious. However, in this case, it's just a deletion. But then there's an entry where schtasks.exe is loaded from the System32 directory, which is normal, but maybe not the most suspicious.\n\nThere's also multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a legitimate tool that shows user context, but if it's run repeatedly, maybe it's part of reconnaissance. However, alone, it's not too suspicious.\n\nThe registry events are mostly \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted\". These could be part of normal operations, but combined with other actions, they might indicate configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe most concerning part is the replacement of sethc.exe. That's a known technique used in attacks, like the \"Sticky Keys\" exploit. Even though there's no direct evidence of malicious code here, the action itself is a common indicator of compromise. Additionally, the use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe in the command lines might be part of setting up persistence or executing commands.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are other signs. There's a lot of PowerShell and process access events. PowerShell is often used for scripting, but if it's being used to access other processes, that could be part of a larger attack. But without more data, like network activity or file modifications, it's a bit hard to confirm.\n\nPutting it all together, the replacement of sethc.exe is a strong indicator. Even if other parts are normal, that single action might be enough to flag this as suspicious. The other events could be part of normal operations, but the sethc replacement is a red flag. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation, particularly due to the **replacement of a system file** and **potential exploitation of scheduled tasks**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n\n1. **Replacement of `sethc.exe` (Sticky Keys Utility):**\n   - **Command:**  \n     ```bash\n     cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\n     ```\n   - **Implication:**  \n     This is a **classic attack technique** where attackers replace `sethc.exe` (a legitimate system file) with a malicious payload (e.g., a backdoor or keylogger). The `sethc_backup.exe` file is likely the malicious payload. This is a **high-risk indicator** of compromise (IoC).\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion:**\n   - **Command:**  \n     ```bash\n     schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\n     ```\n   - **Implication:**  \n     While deleting a scheduled task is not inherently malicious, **combined with the `sethc.exe` replacement**, it could indicate an attempt to **remove traces of prior malicious activity** or prepare for persistence via a new task.\n\n3. **Frequent Use of `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, and `powershell.exe`:**\n   - **Context:**  \n     These tools are often used for **system manipulation** and **malicious scripting**. While legitimate, their repeated use in conjunction with other suspicious actions raises red flags.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Events:**  \n     Multiple entries involving `Registry value set` and `Registry object added\/deleted` (e.g., `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`).  \n   - **Implication:**  \n     These could indicate **configuration changes** or **attempts to modify system behavior** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, disabling security features).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Attack Scenario:**\n- An attacker may have **replaced `sethc.exe`** with a malicious payload to gain **escalated privileges** or **execute arbitrary code** (e.g., via the Sticky Keys exploit).\n- The deletion of the `win32times` task might be part of **cleaning up** or **reconfiguring** scheduled tasks for persistence.\n- The use of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` suggests **manual or scripted system manipulation**, which is common in **post-exploitation phases**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `sethc.exe` replacement:**  \n   - Check the integrity of `sethc.exe` using tools like **Microsoft Defender ATP** or **hash comparison** with trusted repositories (e.g., Microsoft's official hashes).\n   - Monitor for **unusual behavior** (e.g., unexpected network connections, process injection).\n\n2. **Analyze Scheduled Tasks:**  \n   - Verify if the `win32times` task was malicious or if other tasks were created\/modified in its place.\n   - Use tools like **Task Scheduler** or **PowerShell** (`Get-ScheduledTask`) to audit tasks.\n\n3. **Audit PowerShell and CMD Activity:**  \n   - Review logs for **unauthorized scripts**, **remote execution**, or **data exfiltration**.\n   - Enable **PowerShell logging** and **audit policies** for further analysis.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**  \n   - Look for **registry keys** or **services** added by the attacker (e.g., under `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).\n\n5. **Network Monitoring:**  \n   - Check for **unusual outbound traffic** (e.g., C2 communication) from the affected system.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs **requires immediate investigation** due to the **replacement of a critical system file** and the **potential for persistence**. While not definitive proof of a breach, these indicators are strong enough to warrant a **full forensic analysis** and **remediation steps**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to parse through all the JSON entries and see what's going on.\n\nSo, the events are mostly related to process activities, registry changes, and file operations. Let me start by looking for any suspicious patterns. There's a lot of 'Registry value set' events, which can be normal, but when combined with other activities, might indicate something. \n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The presence of multiple cmd and powershell processes could be a red flag, especially if they're performing unusual tasks. \n\nNow, checking the file paths. One of the entries has chrome.exe loading amsi.dll from System32. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. But the path is correct here, so that might be normal. However, another entry shows chrome.exe loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's also a legitimate file, so maybe that's okay. \n\nBut then there's a File created event for a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. The path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be part of a legitimate test, but the presence of a script in the Temp folder could be suspicious, especially if it's being executed. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there are multiple Image loaded events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are standard for PowerShell when running scripts, so that's normal. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creation in Temp might indicate something. \n\nWait, there's also a ProcessCreate event for powershell.exe with a command line of \"& {}\". That seems like an empty command, which could be a sign of obfuscation or a way to bypass detection. Maybe the actual malicious code is hidden elsewhere. \n\nAlso, the repeated use of 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' by powershell.exe could indicate that the script is modifying system settings or trying to persist. The Temp folder is a common place for malware to store temporary files, so that's a point to note. \n\nBut I should check if all these activities are normal. For example, PowerShell using .NET assemblies is standard. However, the creation of a script in Temp without clear user interaction might be suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes could be part of a configuration change or a more malicious activity. \n\nPutting it all together: the events don't show obvious malware, but the combination of PowerShell script creation in Temp, multiple registry changes, and the use of ProcessCreate with an empty command line might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is a legitimate activity, but the pattern is somewhat unusual and could be part of a more complex attack. So, I think this is worth looking into more closely.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation in Temp Directory:**  \n     A PowerShell script is created in the user's temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`). While temporary files are common, the script's name (`PSScriptPolicyTest`) may hint at a **script policy test**, which could be legitimate (e.g., testing execution policies). However, the absence of clear user context or benign command-line arguments raises suspicion.\n   - **Empty Command-Line Argument:**  \n     A `ProcessCreate` event for `powershell.exe` includes the command `& {}`, which is an empty script block. This could be an obfuscation technique to evade detection or a placeholder for malicious code.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events are logged, primarily by `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`. While registry changes are routine, **frequent or unexplained modifications** could indicate attempts to **persist malware** or alter system behavior.\n\n3. **File and Module Loading:**\n   - **Legitimate.NET Assemblies:**  \n     PowerShell loads standard .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`), which is normal for script execution.\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs:**  \n     `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` load `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components). While these are legitimate, **loading such DLLs from non-standard paths** (if observed) could be a red flag. However, the paths here appear valid.\n\n4. **Process Activity:**\n   - Repeated use of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` for tasks like `ProcessCreate`, `ImageLoad`, and `Registry` modifications may indicate **script-based automation** or **malicious payload execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **File Creation in Temp:**  \n  The script in the Temp directory could be a **staging area for malicious code**. Further investigation is needed to determine if the script is executed or contains obfuscated payloads.\n- **Empty PowerShell Command:**  \n  The `& {}` command line is unusual and may signal **obfuscation** or **bypassing execution policies** (e.g., testing if the system allows script execution without explicit permissions).\n- **Repetitive Registry Changes:**  \n  Frequent registry modifications by PowerShell or CMD could indicate **malware persistence** or **tampering with system settings**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Analyze the Temp Script:**  \n   Examine the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1` to check for malicious code, obfuscation, or references to external resources.\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**  \n   Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to determine if the script interacts with external servers or executes further payloads.\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Execution Policies:**  \n   Verify if the system's PowerShell execution policy (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`) is configured to allow script execution, which could explain the `PSScriptPolicyTest` name.\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**  \n   Investigate if registry changes or file modifications are part of a **persistence strategy** (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying system services).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the activities are not definitively malicious, the combination of **PowerShell script creation in Temp**, **empty command-line arguments**, and **repetitive registry modifications** warrants further investigation. These patterns could indicate **benign testing** or **malicious behavior** depending on context. A deeper dive into the script's contents and network activity is critical to determine intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThe first event is about a file deletion in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. That's a bit odd because deleting a script file might be normal, but maybe not if it's part of a larger pattern. Then there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, all involving powershell.exe with the command_line as 'powershell.exe & {}'. These might be benign, like system processes, but repeated entries could be a red flag. \n\nLooking further, there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. That's probably normal. Then another file created by PowerShell in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That seems okay too. \n\nThen there's a Registry value set by PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be malicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The 'whoami.exe' process is just checking the user, which is normal. \n\nThe next set of PowerShell commands are checking if certain .bat files exist. The paths here are a bit suspicious because they have '..\\' which might indicate directory traversal. However, the commands are just testing the existence of these files and exiting 0 or 1. If these files don't exist, the scripts exit with 1, which might be part of a check to see if certain setup steps have been completed. But why so many different paths? It could be a sign of an automated script trying to locate files in various directories, which might be part of a larger operation.\n\nHowever, most of the events are either standard system activities or part of normal operations like log shipping (winlogbeat) or user scripts. The deletion of a temporary script file and the multiple existence checks might not be enough on their own to flag as malicious. There's no evidence of data exfiltration, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation here. \n\nThe confidence is medium because while there are some unusual patterns, they could also be part of legitimate processes. The presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for .bat files might be worth investigating further, but without more context or additional suspicious activities, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing existence checks for .bat files across suspicious paths (e.g., \\\"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\\\") with directory traversal patterns (\\\"..\\\\\\\"), which may indicate automated probing for specific files. Combined with file deletion in Temp directory and repeated lifecycle events, this suggests potential reconnaissance activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly related to PowerShell and Chrome processes. I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the PowerShell events. There are multiple process creations and accesses. The first entry has a command line that checks if a certain batch file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That might be a normal script check, but the repetition of similar commands with different paths could be suspicious. \n\nThen there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, there's also an image load for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is part of the antivirus, so that's expected too.\n\nThere's a File Create and then immediate File Delete event for a temporary script file. That could be part of a normal process, but sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection. However, the same file is created and deleted, which might be a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value set events for Chrome. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times could be normal if it's updating settings, but if it's done in a way that's unusual or part of a configuration change, that might be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Pipe Created event for PowerShell might be normal if it's part of inter-process communication. But again, it's something to note.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the PowerShell scripts are checking for the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned (like C:\\modulo_ativo, C:\\modulo_logico) might be part of a legitimate application, but the repeated checks could be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly for conditional execution. However, the presence of multiple such commands might indicate some automated process or possibly a script that's being used in a way that's not standard.\n\nAlso, the creation of a StartupProfileData file in the PowerShell directory might be normal, but if it's being done by an unexpected process, that could be a concern.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's a mix of normal system activities and potential suspicious patterns. The key points are the multiple PowerShell process creations, the file creation and deletion, and the registry modifications. However, without more context on the environment, it's challenging to determine if these are malicious or just part of routine operations. But the fact that there are several PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various batch files in different directories might indicate a script that's being used in a way that's not typical, possibly as part of a larger attack vector. Therefore, it might be worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Activity:**\n- **Repetitive Script Checks:**  \n  Multiple PowerShell commands use `Test-Path` to check for the existence of batch files (e.g., `objeto_temporario_script.bat`, `componente_secundario_script.bat`). While this could be part of legitimate conditional logic, the **repetition of similar commands** with varying file paths raises questions. Attackers often use such checks to execute payloads based on file presence (e.g., if a staged file exists, proceed with exploitation).\n\n- **File Creation\/Deletion:**  \n  A temporary script file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and deleted. While this could be normal (e.g., temporary configuration files), **rapid creation and deletion** of files in sensitive directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`) is a **common evasion technique** used by malware.\n\n- **Image Loads:**  \n  PowerShell loads legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mpclient.dll`, `mpoav.dll` from Windows Defender). These are **expected** for antivirus operations but could be leveraged by malware to **bypass detection** (e.g., injecting malicious code into legitimate processes).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n- **Frequent Registry Edits:**  \n  Chrome processes modify registry keys **multiple times**. While Chrome may legitimately update settings during installation or updates, **excessive or unusual edits** (e.g., modifying keys related to security policies or user settings) could indicate **malicious configuration changes** (e.g., disabling security features or redirecting traffic).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pipe Creation:**\n- **PowerShell Pipe Event:**  \n  A pipe is created (`PipeEvent`), which is typically used for inter-process communication. While benign in many contexts, this could be part of **malicious communication channels** (e.g., data exfiltration or coordination between processes).\n\n---\n\n### **4. File Paths and Naming:**\n- **Non-Standard Paths:**  \n  Paths like `C:\\modulo_ativo`, `C:\\modulo_logico` are not typical system directories. While they could be part of a custom application, **unusual directory structures** may be used by attackers to **hide malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch **does not conclusively indicate malware**, but it contains **red flags** that merit further investigation:\n- **Suspicious PowerShell behavior** (repetitive file checks, temporary file creation\/deletion).\n- **Unusual Chrome registry modifications**.\n- **Potential evasion techniques** (e.g., leveraging legitimate processes).\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Correlate these events with **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to check for anomalous behavior (e.g., process injection, network activity).\n- Analyze the **content of created\/deleted files** (if available) for malicious code.\n- Monitor **registry changes** for unauthorized modifications.\n- Investigate the **origin of PowerShell scripts** (e.g., user context, parent processes).\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**Interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell anomalies and Chrome registry activity. Further analysis is required to determine if this is benign or malicious."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, the user wants me to analyze these logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There are several entries where the task is 'Registry value set' and 'Process Create'. But then, there's one event that stands out. Let me check that again. Oh, here's one where the command line shows PowerShell creating a new item and setting content to a batch file. The command line is something like New-Item with a path and then Set-Content with \"dir\" as the value. That seems suspicious because creating files and writing commands might be part of an attack, like establishing persistence or executing malicious code.\n\nWait, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is creating files in different directories. For example, paths like C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\.. and others. The use of .. in the paths might be a way to navigate directories, which could be a red flag. Also, the fact that these files are being created in temporary or user-specific directories like AppData\\Local\\Temp might be an attempt to hide the malicious activities.\n\nAnother thing is the loading of certain DLLs. The events mention image loaded for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET framework components, which are normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might indicate that the process is using .NET to perform some operations. However, that's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the tasks, most are standard like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded. But the repeated creation of batch files with \"dir\" as the content seems odd. \"dir\" is a basic command to list directory contents, but if this is being written into scripts, maybe it's a placeholder or part of a larger malicious payload. The fact that there are so many such events in different locations could indicate an automated script trying to create multiple points of entry or persistence.\n\nAlso, the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks might be related to PowerShell's internal processes. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of creating files and writing commands, especially in temporary directories, is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The user mentioned that the file is created in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common place for temporary files, but also a place where malware might store malicious scripts. The filename __PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1 might be a test file, but the presence of such files could be part of a script that's bypassing execution policies.\n\nPutting it all together, while some activities are normal, the repeated creation of batch files with specific commands, combined with PowerShell's use, could indicate an attempt to execute or persist malicious code. However, without more context or additional indicators like network activity or unusual process behavior, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the patterns here, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell creating files (e.g., `New-Item`) and writing content (`Set-Content`) to batch files in various directories (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..`, `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`).\n   - **Example**: \n     ```powershell\n     New-Item \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\\" -Force | Out-Null\n     Set-Content -Path \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario\\..\\\" -Value \"dir\"\n     ```\n   - **Suspicious Behavior**: \n     - Writing `\"dir\"` (a basic command to list directory contents) into scripts may be a placeholder or obfuscation tactic.\n     - The use of `..` (parent directory navigation) in file paths could indicate attempts to traverse directories or evade detection.\n\n2. **File Creation in Temporary\/Hidden Locations**:\n   - A file is created in the **Windows Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`), a common location for malware to store transient or malicious scripts.\n\n3. **PowerShell Execution**:\n   - PowerShell is used extensively, which is a common vector for attacks (e.g., **PowerShell Empire**, **PowerSploit**). The presence of multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events suggests PowerShell is running in a context that may bypass execution policies or exploit weaknesses.\n\n4. **DLL Loading**:\n   - Normal .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded, but combined with the PowerShell activity, this could indicate **.NET-based payloads** or **code injection**.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The repeated file creation may be an attempt to establish persistence (e.g., writing malicious scripts to be executed later).\n- **Command-and-Control (C2)**: The use of `dir` in scripts might be a precursor to more complex commands (e.g., downloading payloads, exfiltrating data).\n- **Evasion Tactics**: File creation in Temp directories and obfuscation (e.g., `..` in paths) may be used to avoid detection by antivirus or monitoring tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Created Files**:\n   - Analyze the contents of files like `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1` and the batch files to determine if they contain malicious code.\n   - Check for encoded or obfuscated scripts (e.g., Base64 strings, PowerShell ISE usage).\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Enable logging for PowerShell (e.g., `Set-PSDebug -Trace 1`) to capture detailed command-line arguments and execution context.\n   - Use tools like **PSLog** or **PowerShell Transcripting** for deeper analysis.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if the created files are being used to execute commands on other systems (e.g., via `Invoke-WmiMethod`, `PsExec`).\n\n4. **Review Execution Policies**:\n   - Confirm if PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`) were bypassed, which could indicate a **Bypass-ExecutionPolicy** attack.\n\n5. **Network Traffic Analysis**:\n   - Check for outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains (e.g., C2 servers) during the time of the activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `.NET` DLL loading) is normal, the **repetitive file creation**, **use of PowerShell**, and **hidden file locations** suggest **potential malicious behavior**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **false positive**, **benign script**, or **malware activity**."}

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a File Delete event where a script file is deleted from the Temp directory. Then there's a Pipe Created event, but no file involved there. Some File Created events, like creating a .bat file in different directories. There are also Image Loaded events pointing to .dll files, which might be normal, but sometimes could indicate malicious activity if unexpected.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some of them are creating files and setting their content. For example, one command creates a .bat file and sets its content to \"dir\". That seems benign, but others might be more suspicious. However, all the created files here are .bat files, which are common for scripts. The paths mentioned are in various directories, some under AppData, which is common for temporary files, but others in more system-like paths.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events, but those are from PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The Image Loaded events include .dll files from .NET Framework, which are legitimate, but sometimes attackers might inject malicious code into these.\n\nHowever, looking at all the events together, there's no clear indication of a security breach. The activities seem to be standard PowerShell operations, creating and deleting files, accessing the registry, and loading legitimate DLLs. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or unusual network activity. The classification here might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show any malicious behavior. But I need to be careful—maybe the repeated creation of files in different directories is part of a larger attack. However, based solely on the provided logs, there's not enough to flag it as interesting. The confidence is around 0.4 because there are some suspicious elements, but nothing conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The logs show routine PowerShell operations (file creation\/deletion, registry access, DLL loading) commonly seen in legitimate system administration tasks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if certain files exist, like \"Test-Path\" with various paths. The commands exit 0 if the file exists, else exit 1. That's a common technique in scripts to check for prerequisites or conditions.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks include things like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Image loaded', 'File created', 'File Delete logged', 'Pipe Created', etc. Some of these are normal activities, like Windows Defender loading DLLs, which is expected. There's also a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which can be normal for temporary scripts, but the fact that it's being created and then deleted might be worth noting.\n\nHowever, the main thing I notice is the pattern of the PowerShell commands. Each one is checking for a specific file path. The paths mentioned are all in different directories, some of which look like they might be part of a larger structure or maybe even obfuscated. For example, paths like \"C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\\" which uses '..' to navigate up a directory. This could be a way to check for the presence of files in a structured manner, perhaps part of a larger script or a setup process.\n\nBut wait, why so many different paths? It might be a red flag if these are part of a malicious script trying to check for the presence of certain files before executing further actions. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that each check is in a different directory might be part of a legitimate process, like deploying software that requires multiple components.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events. These might be related to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers, which can be used by both legitimate and malicious software. However, the presence of multiple such events isn't necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events could indicate changes to the registry, which might be part of an installation or configuration process. Again, without more context, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths again, they all end with \"\\bin\\\" followed by an executable, like \"entrada_base.exe\", \"objeto_secundario.exe\", etc. This structure is common in some software installations, but it's also possible that these are part of a malicious payload. However, the absence of any actual execution events (like process creation) makes it harder to assess.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the lack of any obvious malicious indicators like network connections, suspicious file downloads, or unusual process behaviors. All the events are related to file checks, registry changes, and standard system processes. This could mean that the activity is benign, but the repetitive nature of the PowerShell commands might be part of a larger attack chain that hasn't been fully executed yet.\n\nIn summary, while there's a pattern of PowerShell commands checking for multiple files in various directories, which could be part of a legitimate process, the repetitive nature and the use of relative paths might be worth investigating further. However, based solely on the provided logs, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity. It's a bit of a gray area. I might lean towards the batch being interesting for further investigation but not necessarily malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a pattern of PowerShell commands checking for the existence of specific files across various directories. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Scripting Pattern:**\n   - Multiple instances of `Test-Path` commands in PowerShell scripts are used to check for files in structured paths (e.g., `C:\\modulo_geral\\estrutura_geral\\..\\bin\\entrada_base.exe`). These paths often include relative navigation (`..`), which may indicate obfuscation or a modular setup.\n   - The repetitive nature of these checks could suggest a **legitimate deployment or configuration process** (e.g., verifying prerequisites) or **malicious activity** (e.g., probing for files before executing payloads).\n\n2. **File Operations:**\n   - A temporary file (`entrada_base.exe`) is created and deleted in the `%TEMP%` directory, which is common for transient scripts but could also be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\n3. **System Components:**\n   - Windows Defender-related DLLs (`amshost.dll`, `msiexec.exe`) are loaded, which are normal system operations.\n   - Registry modifications (`Registry value set`) are present but lack context to confirm malicious intent.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n   - No evidence of network activity, payload execution, or anomalous process behavior is present in the logs.\n   - The absence of errors or unexpected outcomes (e.g., files not found) suggests the checks may be part of a **predefined, legitimate workflow**.\n\n### **Verdict:**\n- **Interesting for Further Investigation** but **not definitively malicious**. The logs warrant closer scrutiny due to:\n  - The **repetitive use of `Test-Path`** across non-standard, obfuscated paths.\n  - The **potential for modular or staged attacks** (e.g., checking for files before execution).\n  - The **lack of contextual clues** (e.g., user behavior, network activity) to confirm benignity.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- Correlate these logs with **file integrity monitoring** or **endpoint detection systems** to check if the files referenced (`entrada_base.exe`, `objeto_secundario.exe`, etc.) are legitimate.\n- Investigate **user context** (e.g., admin privileges, user activity) to determine if the PowerShell commands were executed in an unusual manner.\n- Monitor for **follow-on actions** (e.g., execution of `entrada_base.exe` or network communication) that could confirm malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The logs are **suspicious enough to warrant investigation** but lack conclusive evidence of compromise. Further analysis is required."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There's a lot of process creation, process access, and image loading. The first event shows a PowerShell script checking if a certain file exists. The command line is using Test-Path to check for \"C:\\registro_ativo\\...\" and exiting with 0 or 1. That seems like a normal check, maybe part of a script's validation. But then there are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing the process and loading images, including some .NET DLLs and Windows Defender DLLs. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is typical for .NET applications, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nHowever, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. That's a PowerShell script file. Creating and deleting it might be part of a temporary script execution, but the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which could be related to testing script policies. But why would that be interesting? Maybe if it's part of a malicious script trying to bypass policies, but the name is a bit generic.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check for the existence of specific files. For example, \"C:\\registro_principal\\...\" and \"C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...\" These paths might be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that multiple checks are being done could indicate that the attacker is trying to determine if certain files exist before proceeding with further actions.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded. That might be a red flag if the process is trying to interact with or bypass the antivirus. However, it's also possible that the script is legitimate and interacting with Defender for some reason.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a normal command to get user information, so that's probably benign. Then there's a cmd.exe process checking if a file exists in the Temp directory. That's similar to the PowerShell checks, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are: multiple PowerShell processes checking for files, temporary script files being created and deleted, and loading of system DLLs. While these could be part of legitimate operations, the repeated checks for specific files and the temporary script might indicate some form of reconnaissance or preparation for a larger action. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads or modifying system settings. The events are more on the side of normal script execution but with some suspicious patterns. Therefore, it's worth investigating further to determine if these activities are part of a larger attack or just routine operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system behavior and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Existence Checks:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `Test-Path` to check for files in paths such as `C:\\registro_ativo\\...`, `C:\\objeto_auxiliar\\...`, and others. These paths appear obfuscated or non-standard, which could indicate an attempt to probe for specific files (e.g., payloads, configuration files, or indicators of compromise).\n   - **Temporary Script File:** A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the `Temp` directory. While temporary script creation is common, the filename hints at a potential attempt to test or bypass script execution policies (e.g., for privilege escalation or evasion).\n\n2. **DLL Loading:**\n   - PowerShell loads several system DLLs, including `.NET` components (`clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`) and Windows Defender modules (`MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). While these are legitimate, loading Defender DLLs could indicate an attempt to interact with or bypass the antivirus (e.g., via API calls to disable real-time protection).\n\n3. **Other Processes:**\n   - **`whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`:** These are standard utilities for retrieving user context and file checks, respectively. However, their presence alongside PowerShell activity may suggest a multi-stage process (e.g., reconnaissance, privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Repetitive File Checks:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` on non-standard paths could indicate an attempt to determine the presence of malicious files or to map the system's file structure.\n- **Temporary Script Creation:** The creation of a temporary script file (even if deleted) raises concerns about potential in-memory execution or evasion of logging mechanisms.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The overall activity lacks a clear benign purpose (e.g., a legitimate script would typically perform actions beyond mere file checks).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the events are not definitively malicious, they **warrant further investigation** due to:\n- **Unusual file paths** and **repetitive checks** for specific files.\n- **Temporary script creation** that could indicate evasion or in-memory execution.\n- **Potential interaction with Windows Defender**, which might signal an attempt to bypass security controls.\n\n**Recommendation:** Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user behavior, registry changes) and analyze the PowerShell scripts (if recoverable) to determine intent. Consider checking for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration in related logs."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a process event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe being accessed or created. There are several entries with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" and \"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\". Also, there's a few instances where cmd.exe and whoami.exe are involved. \n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the PowerShell processes that checks if a specific file exists. The command is using Test-Path to check for a .cs file. That seems odd because .cs files are C# source code files. Why would a process be checking for the existence of a source code file? Maybe it's part of a legitimate script, but in many cases, attackers might use such checks to determine if certain files are present, perhaps to avoid detection or to execute code conditionally.\n\nAlso, there are several Image Load events for .dll files related to .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that's normal. However, the repeated ProcessAccess events for PowerShell might indicate that it's being used for something unusual. \n\nAnother thing is the multiple instances of \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. Not sure what that exactly refers to, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it might be part of a larger pattern. \n\nI should check if there's any indication of malicious behavior. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes, especially with command lines that check for specific files, could be a red flag. Attackers sometimes use PowerShell for execution, especially if they're trying to avoid detection. The fact that the same command structure is used multiple times with different file paths might suggest that the attacker is checking for multiple files, possibly looking for specific conditions to proceed with further actions.\n\nHowever, without more context, like network activity or other system calls, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of repeated PowerShell access, the use of Test-Path in command lines, and the multiple Provider Lifecycle events might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. \n\nThe confidence level would be around 0.7 because while there are suspicious elements, they could also be part of normal operations. But the pattern is enough to warrant looking into it more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a pattern of activity that warrants further investigation due to the following suspicious indicators:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Execution with File Existence Checks**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts using `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.cs` files (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal\\entrada_temporario\\elemento_base\\src\\unidade_principal.cs`). \n   - While `.cs` files are legitimate (C# source code), this behavior is unusual in the context of process execution and could indicate:\n     - **Conditional execution** based on file presence (e.g., avoiding detection if files are missing).\n     - **Data exfiltration or file manipulation** (e.g., checking for files to target or modify).\n\n2. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Over 20 entries involve `PowerShell.exe` (e.g., `ProcessAccess`, `Provider Lifecycle`, and `ProcessCreate` events). \n   - PowerShell is often exploited by attackers for post-exploitation tasks (e.g., executing payloads, bypassing restrictions).\n\n3. **Unusual `.dll` Loading**:\n   - While loading .NET Framework DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) is normal, the combination with the above PowerShell activity raises concerns about potential **code injection** or **malicious use of .NET components**.\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Clues**:\n   - No network activity, user context, or parent process information is provided, making it harder to determine intent. However, the repetitive and structured nature of the commands suggests **automation or scripting**.\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The **repetitive file existence checks** and **heavy PowerShell usage** are consistent with **malicious behavior** (e.g., checking for files to exploit, preparing for lateral movement, or evading detection).\n- The absence of clear benign context (e.g., no obvious software installation or development activity) increases suspicion.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with other logs**: Check for network connections, registry changes, or privilege escalations around these events.\n- **Analyze the `.cs` file paths**: Determine if these files are part of legitimate software or if they point to unexpected locations.\n- **Monitor PowerShell usage**: Enforce logging and alerting for suspicious PowerShell commands (e.g., `Test-Path`, `Invoke-Expression`).\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **70%** (moderate risk). While the activity is not definitively malicious, the pattern is highly suspicious and warrants deeper analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**: This batch of logs is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of repetitive PowerShell activity, file existence checks, and lack of clear benign context."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File deleted, Pipe created, etc. Some of the files mentioned are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That's normal because those are legitimate Defender files. But then there are other files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. It could be part of a script that's trying to execute something temporarily and then clean up.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The paths mentioned seem random and not standard. The use of Test-Path with exit codes suggests that these scripts are checking for the presence of specific files. If they're not found, they exit with 1, which might indicate an error or a condition that's being checked. However, the repetition of these checks across different paths might be part of a larger script or a malicious activity trying to locate a file that's being hidden or moved.\n\nAnother thing to note is the multiple Process Create events for PowerShell, each with different paths. The command lines are similar, all using Test-Path to check for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories. This could be a sign of a script that's looking for a specific file, possibly a malicious one, across the system. The fact that these paths are varied and not standard might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the Registry value set events and Process accessed events might be part of broader activities, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the file operations and the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, it raises a red flag. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes performing similar checks could be indicative of a script trying to execute a payload or check for conditions before proceeding.\n\nThe key here is the combination of events: creating and deleting temporary files, multiple PowerShell instances checking for the same file in different locations, and the use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known name sometimes used in malicious scripts for stealing keystrokes. Even though the files might be legitimate, the pattern of activity is suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a larger attack, like a dropper that's checking for a payload file before executing it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be false positives. For example, legitimate scripts might use similar techniques. But given the repetition and the specific file names, it's more likely to be malicious. Therefore, this batch of logs is interesting for investigation because it shows potential signs of a malicious script probing the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows activity that warrants further investigation due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive File Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes are using `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in non-standard, seemingly random paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_secundario\\...`, `C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`). \n   - This suggests a script is probing the system for a specific file, which could be part of a **payload delivery mechanism** or **malicious reconnaissance**.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created in the Temp directory and immediately deleted. This is a common **anti-forensic technique** used to evade detection by removing traces of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**\n   - The logs show multiple PowerShell processes executing similar commands, which is atypical for legitimate system operations. The use of `Test-Path` with exit codes (0\/1) may indicate **conditional execution logic** (e.g., checking for prerequisites before proceeding with malicious actions).\n\n4. **Potential for Keystroke Logging:**\n   - The file name `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is strongly associated with **malware** (e.g., keyloggers). While the file itself may not be present in the logs, the repeated checks for it raise concerns about **data exfiltration attempts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate:**  \n  - Some events (e.g., `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` from Windows Defender) are normal system operations.  \n  - PowerShell is a common tool for administrative tasks, and `Test-Path` is a standard cmdlet.\n\n- **Suspicious:**  \n  - The **non-standard paths** and **repetitive checks** for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` are inconsistent with typical system behavior.  \n  - The **creation\/deletion of temporary files** without clear purpose is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Check for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Files:**  \n   - Search the system for the presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in the paths mentioned in the logs. If found, analyze the file's contents.\n\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Execution:**  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **PowerShell logging** to track the full context of these processes. Look for **parent processes**, **network activity**, or **registry modifications**.\n\n3. **Analyze Temp Directory Activity:**  \n   - Investigate the deleted file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) by checking system restore points or memory dumps if available.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement:**  \n   - The repeated checks across different paths may indicate **horizontal movement** or **searching for vulnerabilities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **patterned, non-standard activity** that is highly suggestive of **malicious behavior** (e.g., probing for payloads, evading detection). While not definitive proof of compromise, these indicators merit **urgent investigation** to rule out a potential security incident."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell can be used for malicious activities. Let me check the events related to PowerShell. There are several ImageLoad events for files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and deleting a file might be part of a script execution, but not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that it's in the Temp folder and then deleted could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are some command lines for PowerShell that check if a certain script exists. The paths mentioned are like \"C:\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\unidade_logico...\", which might be obfuscated or part of a larger attack. But the scripts are named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, keystroke loggers are malicious, so that's a concern. However, the commands are just checking if the script exists and exiting with 0 or 1. Maybe the actual malicious activity is elsewhere, but the presence of such a script name is suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be used for inter-process communication, maybe for hiding malicious activities. But without more context, it's hard to tell. There's also a FileCreate event for winlogbeat, which is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events, including registry changes and process accesses, might indicate some level of system manipulation.\n\nOther processes like whoami.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe are normal, but svchost.exe having registry changes might be part of legitimate system operations. However, combined with PowerShell's activities, it's worth looking into.\n\nThe key points here are the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script, and the multiple PowerShell events that could indicate script execution or attempts to access system resources. Even though some events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs), the combination of creating a temporary script file, checking for existence of a keystroke logger script, and multiple process accesses might indicate an investigation is needed. However, without more evidence like actual malicious code execution or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the script name and the PowerShell activities, it's leaning towards being interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Suspicious Script Name (`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`):**\n   - PowerShell commands check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` in obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\tarefa_temporario...`). While the script itself is not executed in the logs, the name strongly implies a keystroke logging capability, which is commonly associated with malicious activity (e.g., credential harvesting).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvyz...`) is created and immediately deleted in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` directory. This behavior could indicate an attempt to execute a script discreetly or evade detection.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess`, `RegistryEvent`, and `ImageLoad` events involving PowerShell suggest potential script execution or system manipulation. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in conjunction with suspicious script names raises concerns.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - A `Pipe Created` event (e.g., for `Calculator.exe`) may indicate inter-process communication, which could be used to hide malicious activities or exfiltrate data.\n\n5. **Legitimate Activity:**\n   - Events involving `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `calc.exe` are typical for normal system operations. However, their combination with PowerShell activity may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not show direct evidence of malicious code execution (e.g., no network connections, payload downloads, or anomalous process behavior). However, the presence of the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` script name and temporary file operations are red flags that warrant deeper scrutiny.\n- **Contextual Factors:** If the system is part of a monitored environment, the PowerShell activity could be part of a legitimate administrative task (e.g., script testing). However, the obfuscation of paths and use of a keystroke logger script name suggest adversarial intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` Script:**\n   - Check if the script exists on disk (even if deleted) and analyze its contents for malicious behavior.\n   - Monitor for subsequent execution of this script or similar files.\n\n2. **Audit PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Review PowerShell logs for additional commands, script execution, or changes to system configurations.\n   - Enable PowerShell logging (e.g., `Transcript` or `ScriptBlockText` logging) for further analysis.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement:**\n   - Correlate the logs with network traffic, user activity, and other system logs to identify potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n4. **Verify Legitimacy of Activities:**\n   - Confirm if the observed PowerShell activity aligns with known administrative tasks or user behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs contain **potential IoCs** (e.g., `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`, temporary script creation) that merit further investigation. While not conclusive of a breach, the combination of suspicious script names and PowerShell activity suggests a need for deeper analysis to rule out adversarial activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I need to check other events.\n\nThen there's a bunch of powershell.exe processes. Some are accessing processes, and there's a whoami.exe command which is usually just checking user identity. But the repeated process accesses and registry changes might be suspicious. \n\nWait, the powershell.exe has a command line that's doing recursive directory listings. That's odd because why would someone need to list files recursively multiple times? Maybe they're trying to find something specific or enumerating the system.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are several .dll files from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that Defender is active, which is good. However, the repeated ImageLoad events could be part of normal operations or might be an attempt to inject code. \n\nThe user fiddelis is mentioned in the file path. If this is a user account that's not typically used for administrative tasks, that might be a red flag. Also, the fact that there's a new configuration file being created for winlogbeat could be part of a setup, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be a sign of something more. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads or connecting to suspicious IPs. The network connections are to chrome.exe, which is normal for browsing. The DNS queries are also typical. \n\nConsidering all this, while there are some unusual activities, they might not be enough to confirm a security incident. The confidence is moderate, but not high enough to classify it as definitely interesting. So, I'd say \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. But wait, maybe the repeated PowerShell commands and file creation are part of a script that's being run. However, without more context or indicators of compromise, it's safer to not flag it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activity including file creation by winlogbeat (a SIEM tool), PowerShell process access, and standard .NET DLL loading. No clear indicators of compromise, malicious payloads, or suspicious network behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there's a file created by powershell.exe in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. Then, the same file is deleted. That's a bit suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file might be part of an attack, like executing a malicious script and then cleaning up traces. The next event is a pipe created, which could be used for inter-process communication, maybe for hiding malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several entries with the same command line: powershell.exe running commands like ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, etc. This seems like someone is enumerating files recursively. That's a common initial step in reconnaissance. The repetition of these events might indicate that the process is running multiple times or that there's a loop, which could be part of gathering information about the system.\n\nAnother event shows a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which might be related to persistence mechanisms. Also, there are registry value set events. Modifying the registry could be an attempt to set up persistence or change system settings to evade detection.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory is normal if someone is installing or configuring the tool, but it's worth checking if that's expected. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell activities. The combination of file creation, deletion, registry changes, and recursive file enumeration points towards potential malicious behavior, such as initial access, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating temporary files is normal. But the pattern here—especially the repeated command lines and the deletion of a script file—raises red flags. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a possibility of false positives, but the combination of events makes this batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, recursive directory enumeration, and registry modifications, which are common in malicious activities like script execution, data exfiltration, or persistence setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
