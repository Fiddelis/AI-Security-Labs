{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so that's a red flag. Then there's 'whoami.exe', which is a standard command to get user info, but not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, the winlog tasks. There are several 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events. The registry modifications could be significant. For example, one event shows 'cmd.exe' adding a registry entry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with a value pointing to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". Adding entries to the Run key is a common technique for persistence, which is malicious behavior.\n\nAnother event uses 'reg.exe' to add another entry named \"entrada_principal\" pointing to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". This is another sign of attempting to create persistent access. Also, there's a 'File created' event for 'modulo_padrao.txt' and a Winlogbeat file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, but creating files in user downloads might not be suspicious unless there's other context.\n\nHowever, the key points here are the repeated use of PowerShell and CMD to modify the registry for persistence, which is a classic sign of malware trying to maintain access after initial infection. The combination of these events suggests someone is trying to set up backdoors or persistent mechanisms on the system. Even though some processes are legitimate, the pattern of registry modifications and the use of command-line tools for that purpose raises a high suspicion of malicious activity.\n\nSo, the classification should be INTERESTING because the logs show multiple attempts to modify the registry for persistence, which is a strong indicator of a potential security threat. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the evidence is clear and aligns with known attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications via cmd.exe and reg.exe under Run keys (HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run) indicate attempts to establish persistence.
