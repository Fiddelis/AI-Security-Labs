So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems legitimate, as MpClient.dll is part of Defender. But then there's another event where powershell.exe is running a command to find passwords in files. The command line uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' or 'password' in various file types. That's a bit concerning because searching for passwords in files could be part of a data exfiltration attempt. However, it might also be a legitimate search by an admin, but in a suspicious context.\n\nNext, there are multiple svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is a normal process, but frequent registry changes could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL, so that's probably normal.\n\nThe findstr.exe process is running with the same command as before. That's a red flag because using findstr to search for passwords across files might be part of a script trying to gather sensitive information. The fact that it's done multiple times could indicate automated scanning.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event creates a file in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for malware to store data, but again, it could be a legitimate script. However, combined with the other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries with registry changes and DNS queries. Chrome doing a lot of DNS lookups might be normal, but if it's part of a botnet or malicious activity, that's a problem. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of normal operations, but if the file is in a suspicious location or has unusual permissions, that could be an issue. However, the path here seems legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious parts are the powershell.exe commands searching for passwords, the creation of files in AppData, and multiple registry changes. However, these could also be part of normal user activity. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some suspicious activities, they aren't definitive proof of a security incident. More context would be needed, like checking the source of the scripts, user behavior, and network traffic. But based on the logs alone, there's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Password Search via PowerShell**  \n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands to search for \"password\" or \"pass\" in files (e.g., `findstr` and `select-string` commands).  \n   - **Risk**: This could indicate an attempt to locate sensitive information (e.g., credentials) on the system, which is a common tactic in data exfiltration or reconnaissance.  \n   - **Context Needed**: Is this part of a legitimate audit? If not, it warrants further investigation.\n\n2. **File Creation in AppData**  \n   - A `powershell.exe` process created a file in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.  \n   - **Risk**: While `winlogbeat.exe` is a legitimate log shipper, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in a downloads directory could indicate tampering or misconfiguration.  \n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple entries for `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` modifying registry values.  \n   - **Risk**: Frequent registry changes by non-system processes may indicate persistence mechanisms or malware behavior (e.g., injecting code into legitimate processes).\n\n4. **Chrome.exe Anomalies**  \n   - Repeated `chrome.exe` activity involving DNS queries and registry modifications.  \n   - **Risk**: Could signal botnet behavior, browser hijacking, or exploitation (e.g., if Chrome is being used to exfiltrate data).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Windows Defender (MpClient.dll)**: Loading `MpClient.dll` is normal for Windows Defender.  \n- **Calculator.exe and urlmon.dll**: `urlmon.dll` is a standard component for Internet Explorer\/Edge, so this is likely benign.  \n- **Winlogbeat File Creation**: If `winlogbeat.exe` is part of a legitimate monitoring setup, this file creation may be routine.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Risk Level**: **Moderate**  \n- **Recommendations**:  \n  1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts**: Check the source and purpose of the password-searching commands.  \n  2. **Monitor Chrome.exe**: Analyze network traffic and registry changes associated with Chrome to rule out malicious activity.  \n  3. **Audit Winlogbeat Configuration**: Ensure the `.yml.new` file is part of a legitimate configuration update.  \n  4. **Check User Context**: Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) is authorized to perform these actions.  \n\nWithout additional context (e.g., user behavior, network traffic, file hashes), the logs suggest **potential reconnaissance or data-exfiltration activity** but are not definitive proof of a security incident. Further investigation is advised."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal because Chrome might interact with Defender, but I should note it. Then there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values and making network connections. A lot of network connections could be normal, but if they're all the same or to suspicious IPs, that's a red flag. However, the logs don't specify the destination, so maybe not enough info here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe created files in the Downloads folder. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious payloads, that's concerning. There's also a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign but could be used to check user context. \n\nThen there's cmd.exe running schtasks to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Those names are generic, but the act of deleting scheduled tasks could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. \n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe being executed with a delete command for \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". This seems like someone is trying to remove scheduled tasks, which might be part of an attack to avoid detection. Also, svchost.exe modifying the registry could be related to system changes, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nI notice multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and setting registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers for various malicious activities. The presence of multiple process creations and modifications might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. \n\nPutting it all together: the deletion of scheduled tasks, multiple PowerShell activities, and the use of cmd.exe to manage tasks could be signs of an attacker trying to remove their own persistence or alter system behavior. However, some of these actions could be legitimate, like a user managing tasks. But the combination of these events, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks and the PowerShell commands, raises suspicion. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators, like unusual network traffic, unexpected file creations, or privilege escalation. The logs mention file creations in the Downloads folder, which might be normal, but if those files are malicious, that's a problem. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm. \n\nOverall, the mix of process deletions, PowerShell usage, and registry changes suggests potential malicious activity, but it's not definitive. It would be worth investigating further to see if these actions are part of a larger attack or just normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` Deletion of Scheduled Tasks**  \n  - **Command Example:**  \n    ```  \n    schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" \/f >nul 2>&1 & schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\" \/f >nul 2>&1  \n    ```  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    Deleting scheduled tasks could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms (e.g., malicious tasks created by an attacker). The generic task names (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`) may indicate an attacker trying to avoid detection by using non-descriptive identifiers.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Activity**  \n- **Multiple `powershell.exe` Processes**  \n  - **Activities Observed:**  \n    - File creation (e.g., `estrutura_ativo.txt`, `winlogbeat.yml.new`).  \n    - Process access and registry modifications.  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    PowerShell is often used by attackers for tasks like downloading payloads, executing commands, or interacting with the registry. The lack of context (e.g., script content, user intent) raises concerns about potential malicious use.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Registry Modifications**  \n- **`svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe` Modifying the Registry**  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    Changes to the registry could indicate attempts to alter system behavior, disable security features, or establish persistence (e.g., adding startup entries, modifying service configurations).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Command-Line Obfuscation**  \n- **`cmd.exe` Execution Example:**  \n  ```  \n  cmd.exe \/c schtasks \/delete \/tn \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" \/f  \n  ```  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    The use of `\/c` and redirection (`>nul 2>&1`) suggests an attempt to suppress output, which is common in stealthy attacks to avoid logging or alerting the user.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Winlogbeat File Creation**  \n- **File Path:**  \n  ```  \n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new  \n  ```  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate tool for log collection, the creation of a `.yml.new` file may indicate configuration changes or tampering. Further investigation is needed to confirm if this is part of a legitimate setup or an attempt to modify log behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **6. `whoami.exe` Execution**  \n- **Command Line:**  \n  ```  \n  \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\"  \n  ```  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    This is a benign utility for checking user context, but its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities (e.g., registry changes, task deletions) could indicate reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Network and Image Load Activity**  \n- **`chrome.exe` Loading `taskschd.dll`**  \n  - **Path:**  \n    ```  \n    C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll  \n    ```  \n  - **Implication:**  \n    While this is a legitimate Windows system file, the context of its loading (e.g., by `chrome.exe`) may warrant scrutiny to rule out tampering or unexpected behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**  \n1. **Check for Malicious Payloads:**  \n   - Analyze the contents of files like `estrutura_ativo.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` for hidden scripts or malicious configurations.  \n   - Use sandboxing or YARA rules to detect known malicious patterns.  \n\n2. **Audit Scheduled Tasks:**  \n   - Verify if tasks like `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon` were legitimately created and if their actions align with user behavior.  \n\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Usage:**  \n   - Enable PowerShell logging and review transcripts for suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`).  \n\n4. **Investigate Registry Changes:**  \n   - Use tools like `regmon` or `Process Monitor` to trace modifications to critical keys (e.g., `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`).  \n\n5. **Correlate with Network Traffic:**  \n   - Check if `chrome.exe` or `powershell.exe` communicated with external IPs or domains that may be associated with malicious activity.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe logs suggest **potential adversarial activity**, particularly around **scheduled task deletion, PowerShell misuse, and registry manipulation**. While some actions (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `winlogbeat` file creation) may be legitimate, the combination of indicators raises a moderate to high risk of compromise. Immediate forensic analysis and correlation with other telemetry (e.g., network logs, user behavior) are critical to confirm or rule out malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first entry is schtasks.exe deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That seems suspicious because deleting a scheduled task might be part of hiding malicious activity. Then there's a bunch of ImageLoad events for taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, but maybe that's normal.\n\nNext, there are several instances of svchost.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry, setting values. That could be part of configuration changes. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed multiple times, which is common but can also be used for malicious scripts. The whoami.exe command is run, which just gets user info, so that's normal unless paired with something else.\n\nLooking further, there's a WMIC.exe process deleting notepad.exe processes. That's odd because WMIC is often used in attacks, and deleting processes might be to remove evidence. Also, the command line for WMIC has quotes that might be trying to obfuscate the command. The ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll are legitimate, but amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender, so maybe the attacker is trying to bypass it?\n\nThen there's the net.exe and net1.exe commands deleting user accounts. That's definitely suspicious because deleting user accounts could be part of eliminating access points or covering tracks. The command_line for net1.exe uses a path that's not the usual system32, which might indicate a malicious binary.\n\nPutting this together: the deletion of scheduled tasks, use of WMIC to kill processes, and deletion of user accounts are all signs of potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell and CMD for registry changes and user deletions could be part of a larger attack. However, some events are normal system processes. But the combination of these actions—deleting tasks, processes, and user accounts—suggests someone is trying to clean up after themselves or manipulate the system, which is a red flag. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled task 'registro_base_005_OnStartup', use of WMIC to delete processes, and deletion of user accounts via 'net' commands. These actions suggest potential cleanup or evasion techniques by an attacker.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and conhost.exe. These are common utilities, but when they're used in certain ways, they can be part of malicious activity. Let me check the commands.\n\nOne of the entries has cmd.exe with the command \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\". That looks like an attempt to delete a user account on a domain. Another entry has \"sc delete win32times\", which is deleting a service. Deleting user accounts and services can be part of an attack, like trying to remove evidence or take control of the system.\n\nAlso, there's a command line for net1.exe, which is similar to net.exe but might be a typo or a malicious replacement. The presence of multiple attempts to delete users and services, along with frequent registry changes (Registry value set events), could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or remove security controls.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, combined with these specific commands, raises suspicion. Even though some events are normal (like whoami.exe checking the user), the overall pattern of deleting users and services, and modifying the registry, seems like it could be part of a malicious campaign. The fact that these actions are spread out but consistent might be an indicator of someone trying to compromise the system.\n\nI need to consider if these actions are typical. Deleting users and services isn't normal unless it's part of a legitimate maintenance task, but without context, this looks suspicious. The combination of these events, especially the user deletions and service removals, along with the registry changes, makes me think this is worth investigating further. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated attempts to delete domain users (e.g., 'net user ... \/del \/domain'), delete services (e.g., 'sc delete win32times'), and modify registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. That's common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting temporary files. The command line shows it's trying to delete some files in the Temp directory. That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes malware deletes its own files to hide.\n\nNext, multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and process creates. The whoami.exe command is run, which is just getting user info, so that's normal. But then there's a lot of entries where powershell.exe is loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's part of normal PowerShell operations when using .NET, but maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file could be a red flag. Maybe it's a temporary script that's being executed and then cleaned up. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, which could be legitimate. But if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be malicious.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entries again, there's a command that deletes files in the Temp directory. The paths mentioned are similar to the one created and deleted by PowerShell. Maybe these are part of the same process. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry and loading DLLs might indicate some form of persistence or elevation of privileges.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of the same command in powershell.exe entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be part of the PowerShell host's normal operations, but if they're excessive, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nBut the key point here is the creation and deletion of the script file. If this is a one-time event, it might be benign. However, combined with the multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, it could be part of a larger attack. The deletion of files in the Temp directory might be an attempt to remove evidence. The use of PowerShell with .NET assemblies could be for executing malicious code.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, like unauthorized access or data exfiltration. The events are mostly about process creation, registry changes, and file deletions. The presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded might be a red herring, as it's part of the antivirus.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the logs show some suspicious activities but not conclusive evidence of a breach. It's on the edge of being interesting for investigation. The combination of script file creation\/deletion and multiple PowerShell activities could warrant further examination, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**\n   - A PowerShell process creates a file: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1` in the Temp directory and then deletes it immediately.  \n   - **Why this matters:** This pattern is commonly used by malware to execute scripts in memory (to avoid leaving traces) or to test execution policies. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which could be a legitimate PowerShell test, but the combination with deletion raises suspicion.\n\n2. **cmd.exe Deleting Files in Temp Directory:**\n   - A `cmd.exe` process runs a command to delete files like `unzipped_*.tmp` and `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` in the Temp directory.  \n   - **Why this matters:** While temporary file cleanup is normal, the specific paths and the timing (immediately after script creation) could indicate an attempt to erase evidence of execution.\n\n3. **Frequent PowerShell Activity with .NET DLLs:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell loading .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll`.  \n   - **Why this matters:** This could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but excessive or unusual loading of these DLLs might indicate code execution via .NET (e.g., for obfuscation or payload delivery).\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - PowerShell processes modifying registry keys (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RunMRU`).  \n   - **Why this matters:** Registry changes can be used to set persistence (e.g., adding startup entries), though the specific keys here are not immediately alarming without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context:**\n- **Legitimate:**  \n  - PowerShell's use of .NET and script policy testing is common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., automation, testing).  \n  - Temporary file cleanup via `cmd.exe` is normal.  \n- **Malicious:**  \n  - The combination of script creation\/deletion, registry changes, and PowerShell activity could indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., PowerShell Empire, Cobalt Strike) or **malware evasion techniques**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**  \n   - Check for additional logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to confirm if this is part of a larger attack (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement).  \n   - Look for unusual PowerShell commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`) in the script file.\n\n2. **Analyze the Deleted Script:**  \n   - If the file `__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1` was preserved (e.g., by forensics tools), analyze its contents for malicious code.\n\n3. **Monitor for Persistence:**  \n   - Investigate the registry changes for potential persistence mechanisms (e.g., startup entries, scheduled tasks).\n\n4. **Check for Exploits:**  \n   - The .NET DLLs loaded by PowerShell could be part of an exploit (e.g., using PowerShell to execute payloads via .NET).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **potentially malicious activity** (script creation\/deletion, PowerShell\/.NET usage) that is not definitively harmful but **requires further investigation** to rule out a security incident. This batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of suspicious patterns and lack of clear benign context."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. First, I notice that there are multiple entries involving PowerShell.exe with various tasks like 'Pipe Created', 'Image loaded', 'File created', and 'Registry value set'.

That might be legitimate, but I should check if there's anything suspicious.\n\nThen there's a file created at 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' in the user's AppData. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use startup locations to persist. However, the file path seems standard for PowerShell profiles.\n\nThere are several 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, which could indicate monitoring or exploitation attempts.

The 'svchost.exe' entries with registry changes are common, but if there were other anomalies, that might be a red flag.\n\nI don't see any obvious signs of malware or attack vectors here.
