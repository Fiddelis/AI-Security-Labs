{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a Microsoft Edge process creating a setup.exe file in the EdgeUpdate directory. Then, the same process changes the creation time of that setup.exe. That's a bit odd. Usually, legitimate software updates might create temporary files, but changing the creation time could be an attempt to hide the file's true origin or age. Maybe the attacker is trying to make it look like a legitimate update?\n\nNext, CompatTelRunner.exe loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. Loading these DLLs isn't necessarily bad, but if CompatTelRunner is doing it, maybe there's some compatibility tool involved. However, I need to check if there's any unusual activity here. The paths look legitimate, so maybe not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event by setup.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. The next events are about services.exe and logon events, which are normal system processes. The multiple \"User Account Management\" events are repetitive and might be part of normal system operations, but the repetition could be a sign of something, though not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command that's checking INF files for defaultinstall sections. The command is looking for specific patterns in INF files, which are used during installation. The script is checking for sections like [defaultinstall.ntamd64], which might be part of a legitimate install process. However, the fact that it's running with Restricted execution policy might be a red flag. But the command itself seems to be a benign check unless it's part of a larger malicious script.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a .yml.new file by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's updating its settings. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which is less secure. Maybe someone manually placed it there, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThere's also a Chrome DNS query, which is normal. The svchost.exe processes modifying registry values are part of normal system operations, but multiple entries might indicate something. However, without seeing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the setup.exe file creation and modification by Microsoft Edge, which is unusual. Also, the PowerShell script checking INF files might be part of a larger malicious activity, but the evidence is not conclusive. The rest of the events seem to be normal system operations. However, the combination of these events might indicate an attempt to tamper with system files or perform an unauthorized installation. But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe it's a false positive, but enough anomalies here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual File Creation\/Modification by Microsoft Edge**  \n   - **Event**: `Microsoft Edge` process creates and modifies `setup.exe` in the `EdgeUpdate` directory.  \n   - **Risk**: While temporary files during updates are common, **modifying the file's creation time** (via `SetFileTime` or similar APIs) is atypical for legitimate software. This could indicate an attempt to **obfuscate the file's origin** or **tamper with timestamps** to evade detection.\n\n2. **PowerShell Script Scanning INF Files**  \n   - **Event**: A PowerShell script checks INF files for patterns like `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]`.  \n   - **Risk**: INF files are used in Windows installations. This script may be **probing for vulnerabilities** in system installation routines (e.g., for exploitation via CAB archives or setup scripts). The use of `Write-Host` to output results is unusual for a benign script and may indicate **post-exploitation reconnaissance**.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Configuration File in Downloads Directory**  \n   - **Event**: `winlogbeat.exe` creates a `.yml.new` configuration file in the user's `Downloads` directory.  \n   - **Risk**: While Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool, **managing configuration files in non-standard locations** (e.g., `Downloads`) could indicate **manual tampering** or **malicious configuration injection** (e.g., exfiltration of logs or unauthorized data collection).\n\n---\n\n### **Normal\/Expected Activity**\n- **Legitimate DLL Loads**:  \n  - `CompatTelRunner.exe` loading `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender) and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Antivirus) is **normal** for compatibility tools.  \n  - `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll` (used for web requests) is **expected** behavior.  \n\n- **System Processes**:  \n  - `svchost.exe` modifying registry values and creating pipes are **common** for system services (e.g., Bluetooth, DNS).  \n  - `chrome.exe` DNS queries and `winlogbeat.exe` file creation are **benign** if part of legitimate monitoring or user activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the majority of events are routine, **three key anomalies** (Microsoft Edge file tampering, PowerShell INF scanning, and Winlogbeat config placement) warrant further investigation. These could indicate:  \n- **Malicious software update tampering** (e.g., injecting payloads into legitimate update processes).  \n- **Post-exploitation reconnaissance** (e.g., probing for vulnerabilities in Windows installation routines).  \n- **Unauthorized configuration changes** to logging tools (e.g., exfiltration of sensitive data).  \n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Correlate these events with **endpoint detection logs** (e.g., process tree, parent-child relationships).  \n- Check for **unusual network activity** from `setup.exe` or `powershell.exe`.  \n- Audit the **Winlogbeat configuration** to ensure it aligns with organizational policies.  \n- Monitor for **unauthorized changes** to system files in the `EdgeUpdate` directory.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Interesting for investigation** — further analysis is required to confirm whether these events are benign or malicious."}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, maybe part of regular operations. Then MsMpEng.exe, which is Windows Defender's process, loading taskschd.dll. Hmm, taskschd.dll is part of Task Scheduler, so that might be legitimate. But wait, CompatTelRunner.exe also loaded taskschd.dll. CompatTelRunner is related to Windows Compatibility Telemetry, which is part of Windows Update. That seems okay.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe creating files in DeliveryOptimization folders. Delivery Optimization is a feature for Windows updates, so creating cache files there is normal. The MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating an Edge update file in Program Files is also typical. Then MpCmdRun.exe loading various DLLs from Windows Defender's directory. That's expected since MpCmdRun is part of Defender.\n\nBut then there's a File Delete logged event for a MicrosoftEdge update file in the user's Temp directory. Deleting a temp file after installation is normal. The MpCmdRun.exe creating a lock file in Windows Temp—also seems okay. \n\nThen there's a process with null name and task \"None\", which might be an error or a log without proper process info. Not sure, but maybe not significant.\n\nThe git.exe entries are creating files in a node_modules directory. That looks like normal Git operations during cloning or pulling a repository. The paths are standard for npm packages. No signs of malicious activity here.\n\nWait, are there any unexpected processes or unusual file paths? Let me check again. The only thing that stands out is the CompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll, but that's part of Windows' normal processes. The rest seems to be standard system and application activities. No suspicious IP addresses, no unusual commands, no unexpected file creations outside typical directories.\n\nSo, overall, these logs don't show any signs of malware or unauthorized activities. They're all part of regular system operations, updates, and user activities like using Git. Therefore, this batch might not be interesting for investigation unless there's more context pointing to something else.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of **normal system operations, application activities, and legitimate process behaviors**. After reviewing the data, there is **no clear evidence of malicious activity, unauthorized access, or security threats**. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate and Normal Activities**\n1. **Windows Defender Processes**:\n   - `MpCmdRun.exe` and `MsMpEng.exe` are legitimate Windows Defender components. Loading DLLs like `MpClient.dll` and `MpCommu.dll` is expected during antivirus operations.\n   - File creation in `C:\\Windows\\Temp` (e.g., `MpCmdRun-3a-53C9D589-6B66-4F30-9BAB-9A0193B0BAFC.lock`) is typical for temporary files during scanning or updates.\n\n2. **System and User Activities**:\n   - `svchost.exe` creating files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\DeliveryOptimization` is part of **Windows Update Delivery Optimization**, a standard feature.\n   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` installing updates in `C:\\Program Files` is a routine operation.\n\n3. **User Applications**:\n   - `git.exe` creating files in `node_modules` directories is consistent with **standard Git operations** (e.g., cloning repositories or installing dependencies).\n\n4. **Registry Events**:\n   - `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `mintty.exe` modifying registry values are **common during application execution or terminal operations** (e.g., configuration changes).\n\n---\n\n### **No Suspicious Patterns**\n- **No anomalies**: No unexpected processes, unusual file paths, or network activity (e.g., connections to unknown IPs) are present.\n- **File deletions**: The deletion of a temporary Edge update file (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_...`) is a **normal post-installation cleanup**.\n- **Process with null name**: The entry with `process: null` and `task: None` may be a logging artifact or incomplete data, but it does not indicate a threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of logs does **not contain indicators of compromise (IOCs)** or suspicious behavior. The activities are aligned with **expected system and user operations**. Further investigation would require additional context (e.g., correlation with network logs, user behavior, or external threat intelligence).\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not interesting for investigation** (no security threats detected)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that a file was created in the node_modules\/semver\/functions directory by git.exe. The files are all named compare-build.js, compare-loose.js, compare.js, and so on. They all seem to be part of the semver package, which is a common library for handling version numbers in Node.js projects.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that git.exe is typically associated with version control, so creating files in a node_modules directory might be part of a normal Git operation, like cloning a repository or pulling changes. However, the fact that so many files are being created in the semver\/functions directory could be a red flag. Normally, when you install a package via npm or yarn, those files would be part of the package's structure, but if this is happening during a Git operation, that might not be standard behavior.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is just working on a project that uses semver, and Git is part of their workflow. However, the sheer number of files being created here seems a bit unusual. Let me think: semver is a dependency, and those functions are part of its code. If the user is running a command that causes Git to create these files, maybe they're initializing a submodule or something similar. But I'm not sure if Git would create those files directly.\n\nAnother angle: could this be a sign of a malicious activity? For example, if an attacker somehow managed to inject a Git hook or a script that creates these files. But the filenames are all legitimate parts of the semver package, so that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe the user is working on a project where the semver directory is under version control, and they're adding those files. But again, that's a bit odd because node_modules is usually excluded from version control.\n\nWait, the files are in the node_modules directory. Typically, node_modules is not tracked by Git because it's a directory that's generated by package managers. So if Git is creating files in node_modules, that might be unexpected. Maybe the user has a .gitignore that's not properly configured, and they're accidentally committing node_modules. But the logs here show that the files are being created, not committed. So perhaps the user is running a command that's generating these files in node_modules, which isn't standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of a build process or a script that's being run by Git. But again, I'm not sure. The key point here is that all these files are part of a legitimate package, and the process is being done by git.exe. However, the normal behavior of Git is not to create files in node_modules. So this might be a misconfiguration or an unusual workflow.\n\nBut then again, maybe the user is using a Git plugin or a tool that interacts with node_modules. For example, some tools might generate files there. However, I can't think of any common tools that would do that. The more I think about it, the more it seems like this could be a benign activity if the user is aware of what they're doing, but it's also possible that it's an anomaly that needs further investigation.\n\nIn terms of security, if this is happening on a system where the user isn't expecting Git to interact with node_modules, it could be a sign of a compromise. However, without more context, like the presence of other suspicious activities or unauthorized access, it's hard to say. The logs themselves don't indicate any malicious content, just the creation of standard files in a package directory.\n\nSo, the conclusion here is that while the activity is unusual, it's not necessarily malicious. It might be a result of a misconfigured Git setup or a non-standard workflow. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm whether this is a legitimate action or an indicator of a security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that `git.exe` is creating multiple files in the `node_modules\/semver\/functions` directory. These files are standard components of the [**semver**](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/semver) package, which is a widely used Node.js library for parsing and comparing version numbers (e.g., `1.2.3`, `2.0.0-beta`).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Files**:\n   - The files listed (e.g., `compare.js`, `parse.js`, `satisfies.js`) are genuine parts of the `semver` package. They are not malicious or unusual in context.\n\n2. **Git as the Source**:\n   - The logs attribute the file creation to `git.exe`, which is unexpected. **Git typically does not create files in `node_modules`**, as this directory is managed by package managers like `npm` or `yarn`, not version control systems.\n\n3. **Potential Explanations**:\n   - **Misconfigured Workflow**: The user might be running a Git command (e.g., `git submodule update`, `git checkout` on a submodule) that inadvertently interacts with `node_modules`. However, this is highly non-standard.\n   - **Malicious Activity**: While the files themselves are benign, the involvement of `git.exe` in creating files in `node_modules` could indicate a misconfigured or compromised system. For example:\n     - A malicious script or hook (e.g., a Git pre-commit hook) might be generating files in `node_modules`.\n     - An attacker could be exploiting a vulnerability to inject files into the project.\n\n4. **Security Considerations**:\n   - **`node_modules` is not tracked by Git**: By default, `node_modules` is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. If Git is interacting with this directory, it may indicate a misconfiguration (e.g., `.gitignore` missing or overwritten).\n   - **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: The logs do not show signs of malicious content (e.g., unusual file names, obfuscated code, or network activity). However, further investigation is warranted if the system is untrusted or the user is unsure of the origin of the files.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Verify the Source**: Confirm that the user intentionally ran a Git command that interacts with `node_modules`. If not, investigate the cause (e.g., check for malicious hooks or scripts).\n- **Audit `.gitignore`**: Ensure that `node_modules` is excluded from version control to avoid accidental commits or interactions.\n- **Scan for Malware**: Use antivirus or malware detection tools to rule out compromise, especially if the system is untrusted.\n- **Monitor Activity**: Track further Git and file system activity to detect anomalies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the files themselves are legitimate, the involvement of `git.exe` in creating them is unusual and warrants further investigation. This could be a harmless misconfiguration or a sign of a deeper issue, depending on the context."}

There's no mention of unusual file names or paths that might indicate malware. However, the sheer number of files being created by git.exe could be suspicious if it's not part of a known process. But in this case, since semver is a standard package, it's possible that this is just a normal installation, albeit via git instead of npm. \n\nBut why would git.exe be creating these files? Maybe the user is using a git hook or some custom script that's installing dependencies via git. That's not standard, but not necessarily malicious. Alternatively, if the user is on a system where git is being used in an unusual way, it might be worth investigating. However, without additional context like other events or processes, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering the confidence level: the events are all related to a standard package, but the process is git.exe instead of npm. This could be a benign anomaly or a sign of something more. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the process is unexpected, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that git.exe created various files in the node_modules\\tcomb\\lib directory. The files are all .js and .d.ts files, which are typical for JavaScript libraries. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. Git is a version control system, and during operations like cloning or pulling, it might create files. However, the node_modules directory is usually managed by npm or yarn, not git. So why is git creating files in node_modules?\n\nWait, maybe the user is using git to manage the entire project, including node_modules. But that's not standard practice. Typically, node_modules are excluded from version control via .gitignore. If those files are being created by git, it could be that the user is not using .gitignore properly, leading to accidental commits of node_modules. However, the events here are about file creation, not commits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a malicious activity here. If an attacker is using git to inject files into the node_modules directory, that could be a problem. But the files listed are all part of the tcomb library, which is a legitimate npm package. The names of the files like dict.js, enums.js, etc., seem to be standard library files.\n\nAnother angle: the process is git.exe, which is expected. The task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is a standard event. The paths are all within the user's Downloads directory, which is a common place for temporary files. \n\nBut why so many files? If git is creating all these files in the lib directory, maybe the user is initializing a git repository inside node_modules, which is unusual. However, without additional context, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering the justification, the key points are: the process is legitimate (git.exe), the files are part of a known library (tcomb), and the activity is within the user's Downloads folder. There's no indication of unusual behavior like unexpected processes, remote access, or malicious file content. The confidence here would be moderate because while the activity is not obviously malicious, the location in node_modules might be a red flag if not expected. However, since the files are part of a legitimate package, it's more likely a standard operation, albeit possibly misconfigured. \n\nSo, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events are consistent with normal git operations, even if the location is a bit unusual. The confidence is around 0.6, as there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but the context is a bit ambiguous.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a legitimate node_modules directory structure, which is consistent with normal version control operations.
