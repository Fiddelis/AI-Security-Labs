{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common scenario when someone installs software. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe activities. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. \n\nLooking at the tasks, there's \"Process accessed\" and \"Image loaded\" events for PowerShell. The image loads include some .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are normal for PowerShell. But then there's a file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1, followed by a deletion. Creating and deleting a temporary script might be part of a legitimate process, like a script test. However, the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted could be a red flag. Maybe it's trying to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell, which might indicate some kind of automation or script running. The user might be running a script that's interacting with the system, but without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother point is the repeated \"File created\" events for .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's part of Winlogbeat's configuration. If someone is modifying the configuration file, that's normal if they're setting up the tool. But if it's being done by an unexpected process, that could be a problem. However, in the logs, it's the winlogbeat.exe itself creating the file, which is expected.\n\nThe ssh.exe events include creating a known_hosts file, which is normal for SSH to store host keys. The network connection detected is also typical. So those might be benign.\n\nThe only suspicious thing is the temporary script creation and deletion. However, that could be part of a legitimate process. But combined with multiple PowerShell activities and image loads, it might indicate some automated task or a script that's being run. However, without more evidence like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nConsidering the confidence, there's not enough concrete evidence of malicious activity. The events could be part of normal operations, like configuring Winlogbeat or running a PowerShell script. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence because the temporary script's creation and deletion is a bit suspicious, but not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and repeated image loads of .NET components may indicate script-based operations. While some events (e.g., Winlogbeat config file creation, SSH key storage) appear legitimate, the combination of transient script file operations and frequent PowerShell activity warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a batch of events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, which is common but can be a red flag if there's suspicious behavior. Let me check what's happening with PowerShell. There are multiple entries of \"Image loaded\" for various DLLs, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and some from Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell running scripts, but I need to see if there's anything unusual.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a temporary file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1. Then, it's immediately deleted. That could be part of a script execution, but the fact that it's created and then deleted might be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks. However, PowerShell often uses temporary files for script execution, so it's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThere are also entries about the registry value being set by Explorer.EXE. That might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The ssh.exe process is creating a known_hosts file, which is typical for SSH connections, so that seems benign.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. However, if this is part of a larger pattern of unusual file creation or if the configuration is modified without user consent, that could be a concern. But in this case, it's just a standard configuration file.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries are creating files in the XboxLive directory. svchost.exe is a host process for various system services, and creating files in that directory might be related to Xbox Live services. However, if there's unexpected activity here, it could be a sign of something else. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, the main suspicious points are the temporary PowerShell script file being created and deleted, and the multiple image loads. However, these could be part of normal operations, especially if the user is running scripts or using tools that require temporary files. The fact that the file is deleted after creation might be a red flag, but it's not conclusive.\n\nI should also check for any repeated or unusual patterns. There are several entries of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" for PowerShell, which might be part of the normal execution flow. The presence of Windows Defender DLLs being loaded is also normal, as Defender might be scanning the scripts.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear signs of a security threat. The activities observed are consistent with normal system operations, even though some components like PowerShell and svchost.exe are involved. However, the temporary file creation and deletion might warrant further investigation if there's a context of other suspicious activities not shown here. But based solely on the provided logs, it's not clearly malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries represent a mix of **normal system operations** and **potentially benign user activities**, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion**: A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in the `%TEMP%` directory. This is consistent with PowerShell's use of temporary files during script execution, especially during policy testing or execution with restricted permissions.\n   - **Image Loads**: Multiple `.dll` files (e.g., `clr.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are loaded by PowerShell. These are standard components for .NET runtime, URL handling, and Windows Defender, respectively. No anomalies are evident here.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat Configuration**:\n   - The `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file is created in the `winlogbeat` download directory. This is a routine operation when configuring or updating log shippers. No indication of tampering or unauthorized access is present.\n\n3. **svchost.exe Activity**:\n   - Files in the `XboxLive` directory (e.g., `AuthStateCache.dat`) are created. This aligns with standard Xbox Live service operations on Windows. No suspicious file types or paths are flagged.\n\n4. **SSH and Defender**:\n   - The `known_hosts` file creation by `ssh.exe` is typical for SSH client operations.\n   - Windows Defender DLLs (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) being loaded by PowerShell suggest Defender is actively scanning or interacting with the environment, which is expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Low Confidence)**\n- **Temporary File Deletion**: The rapid creation and deletion of the PowerShell script file could be part of a **script obfuscation technique** or **evasion attempt**. However, this is also common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., policy testing, temporary execution).\n- **svchost.exe File Creation**: While not inherently malicious, `svchost.exe` is a common host for malicious activity. However, the files created here are associated with Xbox Live, which is a legitimate service.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs **do not contain clear evidence of malicious activity**. The observed behaviors are consistent with **normal system operations**, **PowerShell scripting**, and **legitimate service interactions**. However, the **temporary file creation\/deletion** could warrant further investigation if there are **additional contextual indicators** (e.g., unusual network activity, unauthorized user access, or other anomalous logs).\n\n**Recommendation**: Monitor for **follow-up events** (e.g., execution of the deleted script, network connections to suspicious IPs, or changes to system policies). If this is part of a larger dataset with other anomalies, a deeper analysis would be warranted."}
