The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, but the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them repeatedly might not be suspicious on its own. However, I should check if there's any unusual behavior here.\n\nThen there's an entry for rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and a specific GUID. That GUID might be a red flag. Sometimes, malicious software uses unusual GUIDs or commands. But I need to see if that's part of a known legitimate process or something suspicious.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so the file creation there might be normal. However, the path for the file created by winlogbeat is in the Downloads directory, which could be a sign if it's unexpected, but maybe it's just a temporary file.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well. That seems normal because Excel might be interacting with these security components. But there's also mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET, so that's probably okay too.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is running with a command line that includes -secured and -Embedding. That might be part of a legitimate WMI operation, but sometimes malware uses WMI for persistence. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are several entries with \"User Account Management\" tasks, but no process names. That might indicate some user account changes, but since there's no specific process involved, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, most of the events seem to be normal system activities. The repeated ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe might be normal if that's a legitimate helper process. The rundll32 entry with the GUID is a bit suspicious, but without more information, it's hard to confirm. The EXCEL.EXE loading security-related DLLs seems normal. The presence of winlogbeat is also normal if it's part of log monitoring.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple ImageLoad events for the same process and DLLs might be worth investigating. Also, the GUID in the rundll32 command could be a sign of something, but I'm not sure. Since there's no clear indication of malware or unauthorized access, maybe this isn't interesting. But I'm not entirely certain. The confidence level might be moderate here, but leaning towards not interesting unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains routine system and application activities, including legitimate process executions (e.g., Excel, svchost, rundll32), standard DLL loading from system directories, and benign file operations (e.g., winlogbeat configuration). No clear indicators of compromise, anomalous behavior, or security-relevant events are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entries, there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are legitimate system files, but the fact that they're being loaded by SDXHelper.exe might be normal if that's a legitimate process. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here. The same process is loading these DLLs multiple times, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThen there's a rundll32.exe command line that's launching a shell32.dll with some GUID. That GUID might be a red flag. Sometimes, attackers use rundll32 to execute malicious code by passing a GUID that points to a malicious DLL. But I need to verify if that's the case here. The command line looks a bit suspicious, but without knowing the actual DLL being loaded, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nNext, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log collection, so that's probably normal. The file name is .yml.new, which is a temporary file during configuration, so that seems okay.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE is opening a CSV file and loading several DLLs like combase.dll, mscoree.dll, urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and the Windows Defender DLL. Loading amsi.dll is normal because Excel uses it for scanning. The Defender DLL is also legitimate. So that part seems okay.\n\nThere's a WmiPrvSE.exe process with a command line that includes -secured and -Embedding. That might be part of a legitimate WMI operation, but sometimes attackers use WMI for persistence. However, the presence of -secured might be a flag for something, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the User Account Management events, there are several of them, but they don't have process names. That might indicate some logon activity, but without more info, it's hard to determine if it's suspicious.\n\nThe latest entries show EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder. Creating a shortcut is normal, but if the shortcut is pointing to a malicious file, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't show the target of the shortcut, so it's unclear.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the rundll32.exe command with the GUID and the multiple User Account Management events. However, without more context or additional indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unusual file modifications, or process behavior), it's hard to confirm malicious activity. The rest of the events seem to be normal system operations. So, while there are some red flags, they might not be enough to conclude that this is a security incident. It would be worth investigating further, but based on the logs provided, it's not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **`rundll32.exe` with GUID**:\n   - **Command**: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wbem\\wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding`\n   - **Risk**: The use of `rundll32.exe` with a GUID (e.g., `wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding`) is often associated with **WMI-based attacks** or **malicious payload execution**. While `wmiprvse.exe` is a legitimate WMI process, the `-secured` flag and lack of clear context (e.g., no `dll` path) could indicate **unusual behavior**.\n\n2. **`EXCEL.EXE` Creating `.LNK` Files**:\n   - **Files**: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK`\n   - **Risk**: While creating `.LNK` files is normal for tracking recently opened files, **malicious actors** sometimes abuse this to **persist shortcuts** pointing to malicious payloads. The logs do not clarify the target of the shortcut, so further investigation (e.g., checking the shortcut's destination) is needed.\n\n3. **Repeated `User Account Management` Events**:\n   - **Logs**: Multiple entries with task `\"User Account Management\"` and no associated process.\n   - **Risk**: This could indicate **unauthorized account activity** or **logon attempts**. The lack of process context (e.g., `services.exe` or `WmiPrvSE.exe` involved) warrants scrutiny for **credential access** or **privilege escalation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` loading system DLLs**: `combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, and `mscoree.dll` are legitimate system components. Repeated loading could be part of normal operations (e.g., COM object interactions).\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` file creation**: A temporary `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory is typical during configuration updates.\n- **`EXCEL.EXE` loading `amsi.dll` and Defender DLLs**: These are expected for **antivirus scanning** and **secure execution** in Excel.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the `rundll32.exe` GUID**: Check if the GUID maps to a legitimate WMI operation or a malicious payload (e.g., via memory analysis or network traffic).\n2. **Analyze `.LNK` Files**: Verify the target paths of the shortcuts to ensure they point to benign files.\n3. **Audit User Account Management Events**: Correlate these logs with other security events (e.g., logon attempts, privilege changes) to detect unauthorized access.\n4. **Monitor Excel Behavior**: Check for unusual network activity (e.g., DNS queries to suspicious domains) or file modifications linked to the `real_values.csv` file.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **no definitive malicious activity** is confirmed, the logs contain **potential IoCs** (e.g., `rundll32` with GUID, `.LNK` file creation) that warrant further investigation. The rest of the activity appears legitimate. Prioritize **triaging the suspicious elements** and cross-referencing with other logs or threat intelligence."}
