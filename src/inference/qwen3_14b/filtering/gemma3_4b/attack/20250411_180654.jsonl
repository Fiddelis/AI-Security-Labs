{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes being executed. One of the events shows a file creation at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt', which might be a temporary file, but that's not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, looking further, there's a PowerShell command line that runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path set to the TEMP directory. The script's name suggests it might be related to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that this script is being executed multiple times from different paths (like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\estrutura_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and others) raises a red flag. Even though the paths are varied, the repeated execution of a keystroke logging script is concerning.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate system files, their loading in the context of PowerShell might indicate that the process is leveraging .NET for some purpose. However, combined with the keystroke logging script, this could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThe other events involve Chrome.exe and registry value sets, but they don't seem as suspicious. The main issue here is the PowerShell activity. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed multiple times, even with different paths, suggests that this might be part of a larger malicious operation, possibly trying to exfiltrate keystrokes. The use of the TEMP directory for logging could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch includes multiple instances of a potentially malicious PowerShell script being executed, which is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points towards an interesting case that requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from various paths, attempting to log keystrokes to the TEMP directory. This behavior is highly indicative of keylogging malware, even though some events involve benign processes like Chrome.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. Specifically, I notice multiple instances of the command line using 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with a log path pointing to the TEMP directory. That script name sounds suspicious because \"Get-Keystrokes\" might be related to keylogging, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that it's being executed multiple times from different paths (like C:\\modulo_padrao, C:\\elemento_base, etc.) could indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing the source path each time.\n\nAlso, there are events where files are created and then immediately deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 file. This temporary file creation and deletion might be part of a larger attack, such as executing malicious scripts in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk. \n\nAnother thing is the 'Execute a Remote Command' event with a path pointing to 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. This suggests that the script might be downloaded from a remote location, which is a red flag for potential malware distribution.\n\nHowever, there are also legitimate activities here, like Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll being loaded, which are part of the antivirus software. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files is normal if it's part of log shipping. But the presence of these legitimate processes doesn't negate the suspicious activities related to PowerShell and keylogging scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, the use of temporary files, and the remote command execution are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these suspicious activities raises a high likelihood of a security incident. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with temporary log paths, combined with file creation\/deletion patterns and remote command execution, suggest potential keylogging or data exfiltration activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
