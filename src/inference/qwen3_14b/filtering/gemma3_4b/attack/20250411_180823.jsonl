{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's expected. Notepad modifying the registry might be odd, but without more context, maybe not a red flag yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so this alone isn't suspicious. But then I see calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but the fact that it's being loaded by calc.exe might be normal. However, the next entry is more concerning: a cmd.exe process with a command line that's creating scheduled tasks. The command line includes creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That's unusual because creating scheduled tasks with system-level permissions could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nLooking further, there's a schtasks.exe process creating another task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same command to run calc.exe. Then, svchost.exe is creating files in the Tasks directory. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but creating files in the system's Tasks folder might be part of setting up scheduled tasks, which could be legitimate but also a sign of persistence.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of svchost.exe modifying registry values. While svchost is normal, multiple registry changes might indicate configuration changes by malware. Also, the command lines in cmd.exe and schtasks.exe show the creation of tasks that execute calc.exe, which is a simple calculator. However, using calc.exe in this way might be a way to execute arbitrary commands, possibly as part of a larger malicious payload.\n\nThe presence of multiple scheduled tasks being created with system-level permissions (like the one with \/ru system) is a red flag. This allows the task to run with high privileges, which could be used to maintain access or execute malicious code. Also, the filenames of the tasks have non-English names, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the purpose of the tasks.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with system permissions, the use of calc.exe in these tasks (which might be a front for more malicious activity), and the repeated modifications to the registry and file system by svchost.exe. While some processes like chrome.exe and notepad.exe are normal, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious behavior aimed at persistence and privilege escalation. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activities:**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with System-Level Permissions:**\n   - Multiple `schtasks.exe` processes are creating scheduled tasks (e.g., `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`, `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`) with `\/ru system` (run as SYSTEM) and commands like `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`. \n   - **Risk:** This suggests **persistence mechanisms** (malware ensuring it runs at system startup) and **elevated privileges**, which are common in attacks.\n\n2. **Unusual Use of `calc.exe`:**\n   - `calc.exe` is being invoked via `cmd.exe` in scheduled tasks. While `calc.exe` is a legitimate utility, its use here may be a **front for executing arbitrary commands** (e.g., obfuscating malicious payloads).\n\n3. **File Creation in System Directories:**\n   - `svchost.exe` is creating files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\...`, such as `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`. \n   - **Risk:** This could be part of **malware embedding itself into system-critical directories** for persistence.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - Repeated `Registry value set` events by `svchost.exe` may indicate **tampering with system configurations** or **disabling security controls**.\n\n5. **Non-English Task Names:**\n   - Task names like `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup` (Portuguese) may be an attempt to **obfuscate the task's purpose** or avoid detection.\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious:**\n- **Normal Activity:** \n  - `chrome.exe` performing DNS queries\/networking.\n  - `RuntimeBroker.exe` and `notepad.exe` modifying registry values (context-dependent).\n- **Suspicious Patterns:**\n  - **Unusual combinations** of processes (e.g., `svchost.exe` creating files, `schtasks.exe` with SYSTEM permissions).\n  - **Lack of clear user context** for tasks (no user interaction or justification).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs exhibit **behavior consistent with malware establishing persistence** through scheduled tasks and registry modifications. The use of `calc.exe` and non-English task names adds to the suspicion. Further investigation (e.g., analyzing the contents of the created tasks, checking for hidden processes, and inspecting registry changes) is required to confirm malicious intent. \n\n**Recommendation:** Isolate the affected system, perform a memory dump, and use threat intelligence tools to cross-reference the task names and hashes of involved files."}

Hmm, the user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost and chrome, but others like powershell can be used for malicious purposes. \n\nNow, the winlog events. A lot of them are Registry value set events. That's normal for some system changes, but if it's done by unexpected processes, that might be a red flag. For example, Calculator.exe changing the registry? That's unusual. Also, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe triggering Registry value set events. Maybe that's part of normal operations, but repeated changes could indicate something else.\n\nWait, there's a File created event for winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. But then there's a File created event for powershell.exe creating a file called \"unidade_ativo.txt\". That could be benign, but if it's part of a script that's doing something else, maybe not.\n\nLooking at the Image loaded events: chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that's probably okay. But if they were loaded from unexpected paths, that could be an issue. The paths here seem standard, though.\n\nThere's also a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. If it's being accessed by other processes, that might be normal, but if it's being used to inject code or something else, that's bad. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe being executed might be part of a legitimate command, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that could be a sign of privilege escalation or information gathering by an attacker.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by chrome and powershell, which are not typically responsible for changing registry values. The creation of files by winlogbeat and powershell might be normal, but the combination of these events could indicate that someone is trying to modify system settings or execute scripts. However, without more context like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or other indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut considering that there are several events that are not typical for the processes involved, and the repetition of registry changes, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign, but the combination raises enough flags to be considered suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple non-system processes (e.g., chrome.exe, powershell.exe) triggered registry modification events, which is atypical for these applications. Additionally, powershell.exe created a file ('unidade_ativo.txt') and was involved in process access events, suggesting potential misuse for data extraction or lateral movement. The presence of 'whoami.exe' execution could indicate privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
