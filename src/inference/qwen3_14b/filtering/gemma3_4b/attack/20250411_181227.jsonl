{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process \"powershell.exe\" and command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using PowerShell to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe. The tasks are set to trigger at logon, and they're assigned to the Administrators group with the highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with such permissions could be a way to maintain persistence on a system.\n\nNow, looking at the winlog entries, most of them are under \"Provider Lifecycle\" or other rules like \"Registry value set\" or \"Process accessed\". However, the key part here is the PowerShell commands. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks with calc.exe might be a red flag. Normally, calc.exe is a benign application, but when used in the context of scheduled tasks with high privileges, it could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or maintain access.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries about image loads, such as mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. While that's not inherently malicious, combined with the PowerShell activity, it might suggest the use of .NET for executing scripts or payloads.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other events that might indicate malicious activity. The chrome.exe entries are about pipe creation and registry changes, but without more context, they don't seem directly related to the PowerShell activities. The main concern is the repeated scheduled task creation with administrative privileges.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, which is a common technique in attacks for persistence. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate tool, the context here makes it suspicious. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system event logs indicate **potentially malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive Scheduled Task Creation with PowerShell**:\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks that execute `calc.exe` (a typically benign utility) with **high privileges** (run as `BUILTIN\\Administrators` and `RunLevel=Highest`).\n   - Example command snippet:\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n   - **Red Flag**: While `calc.exe` is legitimate, this pattern is commonly used in **malware persistence techniques** (e.g., using a benign executable as a placeholder for malicious payloads).\n\n2. **.NET Assembly Loads**:\n   - PowerShell processes loaded .NET assemblies like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. While these are standard for .NET runtime, their presence alongside suspicious PowerShell activity may indicate **script obfuscation or execution of malicious .NET payloads**.\n\n3. **High-Privilege Task Configuration**:\n   - Tasks are configured to run as `BUILTIN\\Administrators` with `RunLevel=Highest`, which could allow **privilege escalation** or **persistent access** to the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Non-Suspicious Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe events** (e.g., pipe creation, registry changes) are not directly linked to the PowerShell activity and may be unrelated.\n- **Legitimate system files** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`) are loaded as part of normal .NET operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch shows **repeated attempts to create high-privilege scheduled tasks via PowerShell**, which is a **common tactic in malware for persistence**. The combination of administrative rights, task creation, and .NET assembly loading raises **strong suspicion of compromise**. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Checking the actual payloads executed by the scheduled tasks.\n- Analyzing the source of the PowerShell commands (e.g., logs, user activity).\n- Scanning for hidden processes or unauthorized modifications to system files.\n\n**Recommendation**: Treat this as a **potential security incident** and initiate a deeper forensic analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory, which might be normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension. Then that same file is deleted. That could be part of a script being executed temporarily, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events might be a clue.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, which could be used for inter-process communication. Not sure yet if that's malicious. Then, looking at the command line for a powershell.exe process, it's using ScheduledTask to create a task that runs calc.exe. That's unusual because calc.exe is a legitimate calculator, but creating a scheduled task with high privileges might be a red flag. The user here is setting the principal to Administrators group with highest run level, which could be an attempt to escalate privileges.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome updating its registry is normal, but repeated entries might indicate something, but not sure yet. However, the majority of the logs after that are \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with process set to None. That seems suspicious because if the process is None, it might mean the event is from a source that doesn't track the process, or it's an error. But having so many of these could indicate a potential attack vector, like remote code execution attempts.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, multiple remote command executions, and the use of PowerShell for task creation might indicate an attempt to compromise the system. Even though some events are normal (like Windows Defender files), the presence of the scheduled task with high privileges and the numerous remote command events raises suspicion. The confidence isn't 100% because some events are benign, but the combination does point to potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing scheduled tasks with high privileges, creation\/deletion of temporary script files, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events (potential lateral movement or exploitation).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers use WMI for malicious activities. However, just loading a system DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a normal host process for Windows services, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nAnother point is the execution of a remote command with process None. That's unusual because the process name is missing. Maybe the event is incomplete, but it could indicate something like a remote code execution attempt.\n\nLooking at PowerShell creating files in user directories. The paths mentioned are in the user's AppData and Downloads folders. Creating files there isn't necessarily bad, but if combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also Chrome.exe performing various actions, including loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender files, so that seems normal. However, Chrome doing a DNS query might be benign unless it's pointing to a malicious domain, but the log doesn't specify the domain.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The file paths mentioned are standard for setup.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a mix of normal processes and some registry changes, but nothing that immediately stands out as malicious. The absence of any clear indicators like unusual network connections, unauthorized access, or known malicious file hashes makes it less suspicious. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and remote command executions, even if not clearly malicious, might warrant further investigation. But overall, the logs don't present a clear attack pattern. The confidence is moderate, so maybe around 0.5. The justification would be that while there are some suspicious activities, they aren't conclusive enough to be a clear threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of interest, but no definitive evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **WmiPrvSE.exe** loading `taskschd.dll` (a legitimate Windows component) is normal.\n   - **Chrome.exe** interacting with system DLLs (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) is expected behavior for browser processes.\n   - **Winlogbeat.exe** creating configuration files during setup is consistent with its role as a log shipper.\n\n2. **Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - **`svchost.exe` registry modifications:** While common for system services, repeated or unusual registry changes could indicate tampering (e.g., persistence mechanisms).\n   - **Remote command execution with missing process name (`process: None`):** This could signal incomplete logging or potentially unauthorized remote access, though further context is needed.\n   - **PowerShell file creation in user directories:** While not inherently malicious, this might be part of data exfiltration or script execution if combined with other actions (e.g., network traffic to suspicious domains).\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No entries reference known malicious hashes, unusual network destinations (e.g., phishing domains, C2 servers), or privilege escalation attempts.\n   - DNS queries and file creations are consistent with benign activities (e.g., software installation, log collection).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **do not confirm a security incident** but include **low- to moderate-risk indicators** that warrant further investigation. For example:\n- Correlate the `svchost.exe` registry changes with system behavior (e.g., unexpected service startups).\n- Investigate the `process: None` remote command execution for potential logging gaps or unauthorized access.\n- Monitor the PowerShell-created files (`entrada_principal.txt`, `objeto_auxiliar.txt`) for unusual content or exfiltration patterns.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **No immediate action required** unless the environment has specific sensitivity (e.g., critical infrastructure).\n- **Monitor for follow-up events** (e.g., network traffic from the affected host, unauthorized user activity).\n- **Enhance logging** for processes like `svchost.exe` and PowerShell to capture more context.\n\n### **Overall Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likelihood of malicious activity:** Low to moderate.\n- **Confidence level:** **0.5\/1.0** (insufficient evidence to confirm benign or malicious intent).\n\nFurther analysis with network logs, file content inspection, and user behavior context would clarify the risk."}
