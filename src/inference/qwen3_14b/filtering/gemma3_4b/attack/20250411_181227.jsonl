The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several PowerShell commands. Each one seems to be creating a scheduled task using the New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask cmdlets. The command lines are similar, with the execute parameter set to calc.exe. Wait, calc.exe is just the calculator, right? That's usually a benign process, but the way it's being scheduled might be suspicious.\n\nNow, the triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a red flag. Why would someone create a scheduled task that runs as an administrator every time someone logs on? That's not typical for normal user activities. Also, the task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc., look like they might be obfuscated or generated dynamically, which is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about PowerShell processes, registry value sets, and image loads. The image loads include .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. While these are legitimate, the fact that they're loaded in the context of PowerShell might indicate something is trying to leverage .NET for malicious purposes. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to say.\n\nBut the key point here is the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges. Even though calc.exe is a harmless executable, the method of execution and the permissions involved are concerning. Scheduled tasks running as admin at logon could be a way to persist on the system, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple instances of this command with different task names suggests that this might be part of a larger attempt to establish persistence. Even if each task is just running calc.exe, the pattern is suspicious. It's possible that the actual malicious payload is hidden or obfuscated, and the calc.exe is just a test or a placeholder.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the combination of high-privilege scheduled tasks, repeated PowerShell activity, and the use of administrative rights points to potential malicious behavior. Even if the immediate action is benign, the method and context are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **High-Privilege Scheduled Tasks**  \n   - Multiple PowerShell commands create scheduled tasks with **`RunAsAdministrator`** privileges, triggered **on user logon**.  \n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"tarefa_geral\" -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\") -Principal (New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -RunLevel Highest)\n     ```  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - Running tasks as `Administrator` on logon is highly unusual for legitimate workflows.  \n     - `calc.exe` (a benign utility) is used here, but the **method of execution** (via scheduled tasks with elevated privileges) is suspicious. This could be a **stealthy persistence mechanism** or a precursor to executing malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Task Names**  \n   - Task names like `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, and `tarefa_geral` appear **non-descriptive** and possibly **obfuscated**. This is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\n3. **.NET DLL Loads in PowerShell Context**  \n   - Logs show loading of .NET assemblies (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`).  \n   - **Why this is suspicious**:  \n     - While these are legitimate .NET components, their **loading in PowerShell** might indicate **code injection** or **exploitation of .NET for malicious purposes** (e.g., executing managed code payloads).\n\n4. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**  \n   - Multiple entries for **PowerShell process creation** (`ProcessCreate`), **registry modifications** (`Registry value set`), and **image loading** (`ImageLoad`) suggest **active manipulation of the system**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: Scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be used to **maintain access** to the system.\n- **Malware Obfuscation**: The use of non-standard task names and PowerShell scripting may hide **malicious payloads** (e.g., downloading and executing malware).\n- **Privilege Escalation**: The tasks are configured to run as `Administrator`, which could **bypass user-level restrictions**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Tasks**  \n   - Check the **actual commands** being executed by the tasks (e.g., verify if `calc.exe` is the only action or if other payloads are hidden).\n   - Look for **unusual task triggers** or **hidden scripts**.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Activity**  \n   - Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **SIEM alerts** to trace the origin of the commands (e.g., user accounts, network sources).\n\n3. **Check for .NET-Based Malware**  \n   - Investigate the loaded .NET DLLs for **unsigned or malicious code** (e.g., using tools like **ProcDump** or **Malwarebytes**).\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**  \n   - The presence of `chrome.exe` and `Pipe Created` events may indicate **inter-process communication** (IPC) or **malware coordination**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs show **suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware persistence, privilege escalation, or obfuscation**. Further analysis is required to confirm if this is a **false positive** or part of a **real attack**. Immediate action is recommended to **isolate the system** and **investigate the tasks and PowerShell activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries involving powershell.exe. The first event shows an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL. That might be normal, but then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do this to execute malicious code without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events might indicate something.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command line that's creating a scheduled task. The command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, which is a benign executable, but the trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. This might be a test or a legitimate task, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, since calc.exe is a legitimate program, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple registry changes by Chrome might be normal, but if they're excessive or unusual, it could be a red flag. However, Chrome does update its registry settings regularly, so this might just be normal behavior.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". Having multiple entries here is concerning. If a system is executing remote commands frequently, that could indicate a compromise, like a remote access tool being used. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are false positives or actual malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell command again, the user is creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe. But if the user is doing this as part of testing or legitimate automation, it's okay. However, the presence of multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events might suggest that someone is trying to execute commands remotely, which could be a sign of a breach.\n\nThe key points here are the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges and the numerous remote command executions. Even though some events are normal (like Windows Defender DLLs or Chrome registry changes), the combination of creating a scheduled task with admin rights and multiple remote command executions might indicate a potential security issue. The fact that the same PowerShell script is being created and deleted could be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nHowever, the justification needs to be concise. The main red flags are the scheduled task with high privileges and the multiple remote command executions. These could be part of an attack, so the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because there's a potential for malicious activity based on these events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating and deleting temporary scripts, scheduled task creation with high privileges, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The key here is to look for any patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event. The first one is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. Wait, WmiPrvSE is a legitimate Windows process related to WMI, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. That seems normal. But maybe if there's something unusual about the path or other details? The path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskschd.dll, which is correct. So that might be okay.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal. However, if there are too many registry changes, it might be a sign of something. But looking at the logs, there are several instances of svchost.exe doing Registry value set events. Maybe that's part of normal operations, but I need to check if there's a pattern here.\n\nNext, there's an entry where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That's a red flag. If there's no process associated with a remote command execution, that could indicate a potential attack, like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited. But I need to see if that's repeated or if there are other signs.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating files in the user's AppData directory. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but creating a startup profile file might be normal. However, the file path seems legitimate. Another entry is PowerShell creating a file named \"entrada_principal.txt\" in the Downloads folder. That's not suspicious by itself, but maybe if there's a lot of file creation or in unusual locations.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in several events, including loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files related to Windows Defender. However, Chrome loading these might be normal if it's interacting with the system. But I should check if there are any unexpected paths or if the events are frequent.\n\nThere's also a DNS query from Chrome, which is normal for browsing. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe seems related to configuration files, which might be part of a monitoring tool. The user might be installing or configuring winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. That's probably legitimate.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without a process are concerning. Also, the multiple registry changes by svchost.exe might be part of a legitimate service, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack. However, the other events don't show obvious signs of malware or attacks. The files created are in common locations, and the processes involved are typically found on a Windows system.\n\nBut the key point is the \"Execute a Remote Command\" events. If there's no process associated with that, it might indicate that the command was executed remotely without a local process, which could be a sign of a vulnerability exploit. However, sometimes these logs might have incomplete data, so maybe the process name wasn't captured correctly. But in the absence of more information, that's a suspicious event.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple registry changes by svchost.exe. While svchost is a normal process, excessive registry modifications could be part of a persistence mechanism. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The presence of the remote command execution event is more alarming.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes some potentially suspicious events, like the remote command execution and multiple registry changes, but other events are normal. However, the presence of even one suspicious event might warrant further investigation. Since the user is asking whether the logs are interesting, the answer is probably yes, but I need to check if there's enough evidence to classify them as malicious or just possibly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious events. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Events:**\n1. **Remote Command Execution without a Process:**\n   - Events with **\"Execute a Remote Command\"** and **`process: None`** are highly unusual. This could indicate a **remote code execution vulnerability exploitation** (e.g., via unpatched services or protocols) or incomplete log data. The absence of a process name raises red flags, as legitimate commands typically involve a known process.\n\n2. **Excessive Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - Multiple **`svchost.exe`** entries with **\"Registry value set\"** might indicate **persistence mechanisms** or **malicious configuration changes**. While `svchost.exe` is legitimate, frequent and unexplained registry changes could signal an attack.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity:**\n- **`WmiPrvSE.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`:** Normal Windows process behavior related to Task Scheduler.\n- **`chrome.exe` loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`:** These are legitimate Windows Defender components; Chrome interacting with them is plausible.\n- **`powershell.exe` creating files in `AppData` and `Downloads`:** Common for user activities, though further context (e.g., file content) would clarify intent.\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` file creation:** Likely part of log management\/configuration, which is normal for monitoring tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs **contain suspicious indicators** (e.g., remote command execution without a process) that warrant **further investigation**. While many entries are legitimate, the presence of potentially malicious activity (e.g., unexplained remote execution) makes this batch **\"interesting\"** from a security perspective. A deeper analysis (e.g., correlating with other logs, checking file hashes, or network traffic) is recommended to confirm benignity or malicious intent. \n\n**Final Verdict:** 🚨 **Interesting (Potential Threat Detected)**."}
