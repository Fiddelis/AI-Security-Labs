{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about ssh.exe creating a known_hosts file in the .ssh directory. That seems normal, like a user setting up SSH keys.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being created, which is common. The next few events show PowerShell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are related to .NET, so maybe running a script. Then a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. But then it's immediately deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nThe next events include PowerShell loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender and urlmon.dll. The MpClient.dll is part of Defender, so that's normal. The urlmon.dll is used for URL monikers, which might be used in some legitimate tasks but could also be part of a download.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its setup. The svchost.exe events are creating files in the XboxLive directory, which might be normal system activity.\n\nPutting it all together: The main red flag is the creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving traces. The rest of the events don't show obvious signs of compromise, but the script file's quick deletion is suspicious. So this batch is interesting because it could indicate an attempted malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1) was created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory, which is a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts without leaving persistent traces. This behavior warrants further investigation.\"\n}"}
