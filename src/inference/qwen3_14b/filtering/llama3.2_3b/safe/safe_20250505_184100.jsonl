{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: Update.exe is being run from the SquirrelTemp directory with an install command. Squirrel is often used for updates, so maybe that's legitimate. But then, the next few events show Update.exe loading various .dll files from system directories like SysWOW64 and the .NET Framework. That's normal for some applications, but I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen there's a File created event where Update.exe creates another Update.exe in the Discord AppData folder. Wait, that's odd. Why would an update executable create another executable in a user's AppData? That might be a red flag. Maybe it's a dropper or trying to install something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Process Create events for Discord.exe with various command-line arguments. Some of these seem normal, like launching a GPU process or utility, but the command lines are quite long and have a lot of parameters. That's typical for browsers or apps with many features, but the presence of --disable-features with a long list might be something to check. However, I don't see any obvious malicious flags here.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of a Discord.lnk shortcut on the desktop. Shortcuts themselves aren't bad, but if they're being created by an update process, maybe it's part of a phishing attempt or trying to trick the user into launching something malicious. However, the shortcut points to the existing Discord.exe in AppData, which might be legitimate if Discord is installed there.\n\nThe repeated Process Access events for Update.exe and Discord.exe might indicate that the processes are interacting with each other, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The loading of .dll files from standard locations doesn't immediately raise a red flag unless they're unexpected.\n\nWait, but the initial Update.exe is in the SquirrelTemp directory, which is a temporary folder. If that executable is creating another executable in AppData and a shortcut, it might be trying to persist after the update. Also, the fact that Update.exe is creating another executable in the same directory as Discord's AppData could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nHowever, I should consider that Discord does use Squirrel for updates, so some of these actions might be normal. But the creation of a new executable in the user's AppData and a desktop shortcut could be suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate update process, but without more information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother angle: Are there any unexpected processes or unusual command-line arguments? The command lines for Discord.exe are long but contain standard parameters. The presence of --disable-features might be normal for certain configurations. However, the creation of the shortcut and the new executable might be unusual if they're not part of the standard update process.\n\nIn summary, the main points of interest are the creation of a new executable by Update.exe in the AppData folder and the shortcut on the desktop. These could be signs of malicious activity, but they could also be part of a legitimate update. More analysis, like checking the hashes of the files or looking for other anomalies, would be needed to confirm. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the answer is likely yes, because there are suspicious activities that warrant further examination.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **mixed indicators of both legitimate activity and potential suspicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n1. **Update.exe via Squirrel**  \n   - The initial `Update.exe` execution from the `SquirrelTemp` directory with an `--install` command is **consistent with Squirrel's update mechanism**, commonly used by applications like Discord for patching. This is typically **benign**.\n\n2. **Loading System DLLs**  \n   - Loading `.dll` files from standard system directories (e.g., `SysWOW64`, `.NET Framework`) is **normal** for applications requiring runtime dependencies.\n\n3. **Discord.exe Process Creation**  \n   - Multiple `Discord.exe` processes with lengthy command-line arguments (e.g., `--type=utility`, `--disable-features`) are **consistent with Discord's multi-process architecture** (e.g., GPU, network, utility processes). The parameters align with typical browser-like behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by Update.exe**  \n   - **`Update.exe` creating another `Update.exe` in the user's AppData directory** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\...`) is **unusual**. While Squirrel may temporarily create files during updates, **generating a duplicate executable in the AppData folder** could indicate **malicious persistence** (e.g., a dropper or backdoor).\n\n2. **Desktop Shortcut Creation**  \n   - The **creation of a `Discord.lnk` shortcut on the desktop** by `Update.exe` raises concerns. While shortcuts are harmless, their **creation by an update process** (especially in a non-standard location) could be an attempt to **social-engineer the user** (e.g., tricking them into launching a malicious payload).\n\n3. **Repeated Process Access Events**  \n   - Multiple **`ProcessAccess` events** for `Update.exe` and `Discord.exe` suggest **inter-process communication** or **unusual interaction patterns**. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate **tampering** or **exploitation** if combined with other anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Questions for Further Investigation**\n- **Are the hashes of the created `Update.exe` and `Discord.lnk` files known good?**  \n  - If the files are **unsigned**, **uncommon hashes**, or **not aligned with official Discord releases**, this would strongly indicate compromise.\n\n- **Is the `Update.exe` process legitimate?**  \n  - Verify the **source path** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\...`) and **digital signature** of the executable. A **malicious dropper** might mimic legitimate update processes.\n\n- **Is the shortcut (`Discord.lnk`) pointing to a legitimate target?**  \n  - Check the **target path** of the shortcut. If it points to an **unexpected location** (e.g., a hidden or obfuscated executable), this would be a red flag.\n\n- **Are there additional anomalies in the logs?**  \n  - Look for **unusual network activity**, **registry changes**, or **elevated privileges** during these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis log batch **merits further investigation** due to the **unusual file creation and shortcut generation** by `Update.exe`. While some behavior aligns with legitimate update processes, the **creation of a duplicate executable and desktop shortcut** are **high-risk indicators** that could signal **malware persistence** or **social engineering**. A **malware analysis** of the involved files and **network traffic inspection** would be critical to confirm benignity or identify exploitation."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first entry is about Discord.exe loading a DLL called vk_swiftshader.dll. That's a legitimate file, maybe part of the application's dependencies. Then there's ProcessAccess events for Discord.exe and Update.exe. \n\nThen there's an entry where reg.exe is adding an entry to the Run key in the registry, pointing to Update.exe with a command to start Discord.exe. That seems suspicious because adding a registry entry in the Run key could be a way to persist the application across reboots. \n\nNext, there are multiple reg.exe commands modifying the registry under Software\\Classes for Discord, setting default icons and shell commands. That might be part of creating a custom protocol handler, which isn't inherently bad, but could be a red flag if it's being used to execute arbitrary code.\n\nLooking at the command_line for one of the Discord.exe processes, there's a --url parameter pointing to \"https:\/\/f.a.k\/e\". That's a suspicious URL, possibly a placeholder or a fake URL. Also, the presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for Discord.exe with different command-line arguments might indicate unusual activity.\n\nThere are multiple FileCreate events for Discord.lnk shortcuts on the desktop and in the Start Menu. Creating shortcuts isn't unusual, but combined with the registry changes and the suspicious URL, it might be part of an installation or a potential malicious setup.\n\nThe repeated ImageLoad events for ffmpeg.dll could be normal if it's part of the application, but if there's an unusual version or if it's being loaded from an unexpected location, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the path seems to be within the Discord application directory.\n\nThe key points here are the registry modifications that could be used for persistence, the suspicious URL in the command line, and the creation of shortcuts and registry entries that might be part of a broader attempt to modify the system's behavior. Even though some of these actions could be legitimate (like creating shortcuts or registry entries for a proper application), the combination of these events along with the suspicious URL and the use of reg.exe to modify the Run key might indicate a potential security threat. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that this could be a normal installation or update process for Discord. But the presence of the fake URL and the multiple registry changes might be more indicative of something malicious. Since the user is asking for whether this is interesting for investigation, I think the answer would lean towards INTERESTING because the combination of these events could be part of a malicious activity, even if some parts are legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of legitimate and suspicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Legitimate Aspects**:\n- **DLL Loading**: `vk_swiftshader.dll` and `ffmpeg.dll` are commonly used in applications like Discord for graphics and media processing.\n- **Process Creation**: Multiple `Discord.exe` processes with command-line arguments (e.g., `--type=gpu-process`, `--url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e`) align with typical Electron-based application behavior.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Registry Persistence**:\n   - `reg.exe` modifies the **Run key** to execute `Update.exe` with a command to launch `Discord.exe`. This could be a method for **persistence** across reboots, though not inherently malicious.\n   - Modifications to **`Software\\Classes`** (e.g., custom protocol handlers, default icons) may indicate attempts to **manipulate user interactions** or **redirect traffic**.\n\n2. **Suspicious URL**:\n   - The `--url=https:\/\/f.a.k\/e` parameter in a `Discord.exe` process points to a **placeholder\/fake URL**, which could signal **malicious command-and-control (C2) communication** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n3. **Shortcut Creation**:\n   - Multiple `Discord.lnk` shortcuts created on the desktop and in the Start Menu may be part of a **broad distribution** effort, but combined with registry changes, could hint at **social engineering** or **unauthorized installation**.\n\n4. **Unusual Process Behavior**:\n   - The `--type=crashpad-handler` and `--initial-client-data` parameters in one `Discord.exe` process suggest **unusual crash reporting behavior**, which might be exploited for **data collection**.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile some activity aligns with normal Discord operations, the **combination of registry persistence, suspicious URLs, and shortcut creation** raises **red flags**. These patterns are often seen in **malware persistence mechanisms** or **covert data exfiltration**. \n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Reason**: The logs warrant further investigation to rule out **malicious intent**, such as **persistence, C2 communication, or unauthorized system modification**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user is asking if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Discord.exe is loading DLLs like libGLESv2.dll and vulkan-1.dll. Those are legitimate libraries, especially for a graphics application like Discord. Then there's a FileCreated event for Discord.lnk on the desktop. That seems normal too, maybe a shortcut created by the user or the application itself.\n\nNext, multiple ProcessAccess events. These are common in normal operations, but having several of them might be a red flag. However, since they're all from Discord.exe, maybe it's just part of its normal functioning. Then a PipeCreated event. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which is normal for applications like Discord.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the ProcessCreate events, it's a typical launch of Discord with various parameters. The presence of --no-sandbox and --disable-features might be a concern, but those flags are sometimes used in legitimate scenarios too, maybe for performance or specific features.\n\nThen there are entries involving reg.exe modifying the registry. Adding a URL protocol handler for Discord. That's a bit more suspicious. Normally, applications might register themselves as handlers for certain URLs, but it's important to check if this is part of the application's normal installation. However, modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity if done without user consent.\n\nAnother reg.exe event adds a command for the Discord protocol. The command line includes the path to Discord.exe with some parameters. This seems like standard registry setup for a protocol handler, but I need to be cautious. The use of reg.exe by the user might be legitimate, but if it's done by the application without user interaction, that could be a problem.\n\nThe NetworkConnect and DnsQuery events are normal for an application that connects to the internet, like Discord. The PipeCreated events again are part of normal IPC.\n\nLooking back at the registry modifications, the user didn't mention any unusual behavior, but the logs show that reg.exe was used to change the registry. If the user didn't install anything new, this might be unexpected. However, if Discord is being installed or updated, these changes could be part of the process.\n\nThe key points here are the registry modifications. While some of the events are normal for Discord, the use of reg.exe to set up protocol handlers might be a red flag. It's possible that this is part of the application's normal operation, but in some cases, malicious software uses registry changes to persist or alter system behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But given that the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the registry changes and the multiple ProcessAccess events might warrant further examination. It's not definitively malicious, but there are enough suspicious elements to consider it worthy of investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events includes a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**:\n1. **DLL Loading**:  \n   - Discord.exe loading `libGLESv2.dll` and `vulkan-1.dll` is expected for graphics rendering.  \n   - `Discord.exe` itself being loaded is part of normal application execution.\n\n2. **File Creation**:  \n   - Creation of a shortcut (`Discord.lnk`) on the desktop is typical during installation or user interaction.\n\n3. **Network\/DNS Activity**:  \n   - `NetworkConnect` and `DnsQuery` events are standard for an application like Discord, which communicates over the internet.\n\n4. **Pipe Creation**:  \n   - Multiple `PipeCreated` events are common for inter-process communication (IPC) in applications with complex architectures.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:\n1. **Registry Modifications via `reg.exe`**:  \n   - **URL Protocol Handler**:  \n     - Adding a registry entry under `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord` to associate the `discord:` protocol with Discord.exe.  \n     - **Why this matters**: While legitimate applications (e.g., Discord) may register protocol handlers, this requires user consent. If the user did not explicitly install or configure this, it could indicate unauthorized changes.  \n   - **Command-Line Parameter**:  \n     - The registry entry points to a command line that includes `--url -- %1`, which is typical for protocol handlers but should be verified for unexpected behavior (e.g., data exfiltration).\n\n2. **Process Access Events**:  \n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` events (e.g., `ProcessAccess` with `TargetProcessName=explorer.exe`) could indicate lateral movement or reconnaissance. However, without additional context (e.g., anomalous permissions or unexpected process interactions), this is inconclusive.\n\n3. **Command-Line Flags**:  \n   - The use of `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-features` in a `ProcessCreate` event might be legitimate (e.g., for performance or testing), but these flags can also be exploited by malicious actors to bypass security mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Questions for Further Investigation**:\n- **User Context**:  \n  - Did the user install or update Discord recently?  \n  - Are the registry changes part of a known legitimate installation process?  \n- **Behavioral Anomalies**:  \n  - Are the `ProcessAccess` events tied to processes that should not be interacting with Discord?  \n  - Is the `discord:` protocol handler being used for unexpected purposes (e.g., launching malicious URLs)?  \n- **Network Traffic**:  \n  - Are the DNS queries and network connections consistent with Discord's expected behavior (e.g., connecting to known servers)?\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile some activity (e.g., DLL loading, shortcuts) is normal for Discord, the **registry modifications via `reg.exe`** and the **unusual command-line flags** warrant further investigation. These could indicate either legitimate behavior (e.g., a new feature in Discord) or potentially malicious activity (e.g., persistence or protocol hijacking). **This batch is suspicious enough to merit closer examination**, especially if the user did not authorize these changes."}

Discord is a known application, and it's possible that it uses ffmpeg.dll for video processing or other features.
