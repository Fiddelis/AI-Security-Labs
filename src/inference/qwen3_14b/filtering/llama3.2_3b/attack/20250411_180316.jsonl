So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a bunch of process accesses, image loads, and registry events. The processes involved include common ones like powershell.exe, calc.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, and some others. \n\nHmm, I notice that powershell.exe is appearing multiple times with the ProcessAccess task. That might be normal, but maybe not. Then there's the calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe is different from calc.exeâ€”maybe that's a typo or a different process? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete a process called notepad.exe. That seems suspicious because using WMIC to delete processes can be part of a malicious activity, like trying to remove something the attacker doesn't want running. Then there's a WMIC.exe process itself, which is also used here. \n\nAlso, there's a schtasks command to delete a task named \"win32times\". Scheduled tasks being deleted might be part of an attack, especially if the task was monitoring or something. The schtasks.exe process is involved here, which is a legitimate tool but can be abused.\n\nAnother thing is the use of whoami.exe, which is normal for checking user context, but if it's part of a chain of commands, it could be part of privilege escalation attempts. \n\nI also see some registry value sets and registry object deletions. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. \n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess might indicate that someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which could be part of an attack. Also, the command_line in some entries has empty commands, like \"cmd.exe \/c \" with nothing after, which might be a sign of something incomplete or trying to execute a command that's not shown, maybe obfuscated.\n\nPutting this all together: the events include multiple process creations and deletions, use of WMIC and schtasks to manipulate processes and tasks, registry changes, and multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe. These activities could be indicative of an attacker trying to manipulate the system, delete traces, or establish persistence. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and the specific commands used (like deleting processes and scheduled tasks) are red flags. \n\nTherefore, this batch seems interesting because it contains activities that are commonly associated with malicious behavior, such as process deletion, registry modifications, and use of tools that can be exploited for attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including multiple process access events for powershell.exe, deletion of processes via WMIC and schtasks commands, registry modifications, and unusual image loading of system files.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look for any suspicious patterns or activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first few entries mention 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events. The files loaded are clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but the repetition might be worth noting. Then there's a 'File created' event with a temporary script file. Creating temporary files can be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. These might be part of normal operations, but the same command line is used repeatedly, which could indicate a script that's being run multiple times. The command lines involve checking if certain paths exist and exiting with 0 or 1. This might be a way to check for the presence of files or to execute commands conditionally.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some of the command lines are testing for the existence of .bat files in various directories. If these files are not present, the script exits with 1. This could be a way to check for the presence of malicious files or to trigger actions based on their existence. However, without seeing the actual content of those .bat files, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThere's also a 'File Delete logged' event where a temporary script file is deleted. Deleting temporary files is normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern of creating and deleting files to avoid detection, that could be suspicious.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the registry, which can be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'Pipe Created' events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be legitimate, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nI also see that some of the image loads are from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something else.\n\nPutting this all together, the main concerns are the repeated use of PowerShell with scripts that check for the existence of .bat files, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and the multiple image loads. These could be indicators of a script-based attack, possibly trying to execute commands or establish persistence. However, some of these activities could be part of normal operations, like automated testing or legitimate scripts. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous, but the combination of these events does raise some red flags that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Abuse for Conditional Execution**\n- **Recurring Command Lines**: Multiple entries show PowerShell scripts using `Test-Path` to check for the existence of `.bat` files in non-standard, deeply nested paths (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_geral\\modulo_temporario\\..`). These paths often include parent directory references (`..`), which could be obfuscation tactics to evade detection or test for the presence of malicious payloads.\n- **Exit Codes**: The scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on whether the `.bat` file exists. This could indicate:\n  - **Conditional execution** of payloads if specific files are present.\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., checking for a trigger file to activate a backdoor).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary Script File Creation and Deletion**\n- **File Creation**: A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. This is common in legitimate scenarios (e.g., script execution), but **creation of temporary files followed by immediate deletion** (observed in the `File Delete logged` event) raises concerns:\n  - **Evasion tactics**: To avoid leaving forensic traces.\n  - **Payload execution**: The script may be used to execute commands or download additional payloads before deletion.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual Image Loads**\n- **.NET Framework DLLs**: Repeated loading of `clr.dll` and `mscorlib.ni.dll` (part of the .NET runtime) is normal for PowerShell execution. However, **repetition of these events** could indicate:\n  - **Malicious use of .NET** for code obfuscation or execution.\n  - **Persistence via DLL hijacking** or injection.\n- **Windows Defender DLL**: The load of `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender's real-time protection component) is legitimate but could be **exploited in context** (e.g., mimicking legitimate processes).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry Value Set**: Multiple `Registry value set` events are logged. While benign in some contexts, they could indicate:\n  - **Persistence** (e.g., adding registry keys to autorun PowerShell scripts).\n  - **Configuration changes** to disable security features (e.g., disabling Defender).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Lack of Contextual Clues**\n- **No clear benign purpose**: The activities (e.g., checking for `.bat` files, temporary script creation) lack clear justification for legitimate use.\n- **Repetition**: The same PowerShell command lines are repeated across multiple events, suggesting **automation or scripted attacks**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **strongly suggest potential malicious activity**, including:\n- **PowerShell-based attacks** (e.g., conditional execution, persistence).\n- **Evasion techniques** (temporary file creation\/deletion).\n- **Possible exploitation of .NET or Windows Defender components**.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate the `.bat` files** referenced in the `Test-Path` commands (if present) for malicious content.\n2. **Analyze the PowerShell scripts** for obfuscation, command injection, or lateral movement.\n3. **Check for registry changes** related to persistence or security bypass.\n4. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to identify exfiltration or command-and-control activity.\n\nThis batch of events requires **immediate forensic analysis** to confirm whether it represents a security incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the JSON entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell and Chrome. There's a lot of file creation and registry changes. Let me check the command lines. Some entries have PowerShell commands creating files and setting their content to \"dir\". For example, one command creates a .bat file and sets its content to \"dir\". That might be normal, but creating multiple such files in different directories could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the file paths, some are in common locations like AppData or Temp, which are often used by malware. The fact that multiple files are being created with names that include \"script.bat\" and \"dir\" might indicate that someone is trying to execute commands or scripts. \n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events pointing to DLLs from Windows Defender. That's normal, but if there were unexpected DLLs or if the image load events were from unknown sources, that would be suspicious. However, in this case, the DLLs are from legitimate Windows components. \n\nAnother thing is the use of \"New-Item\" and \"Set-Content\" commands. These are standard PowerShell commands, but when used in a pattern across multiple files, it might be part of an automated script. The repetition of creating files in different directories could be an attempt to leave backdoors or execute malicious code.\n\nThe registry value set events might be part of configuring something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with the file creation, it's possible that these are part of a larger attack. \n\nI should also check for any anomalies. The user mentioned that Chrome is involved, but there's no obvious connection between Chrome and the PowerShell activities here. The events don't show any network activity or unusual process creations. \n\nThe fact that files are being created and then deleted (like the __PSScriptPolicyTest file) might be an attempt to clean up traces. However, that's a common technique for malware, so it's worth noting.\n\nOverall, while some activities are normal, the pattern of creating multiple files with similar names, using PowerShell extensively, and the presence of registry changes could indicate a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch is interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Scripting**:\n   - Multiple entries involve PowerShell commands using `New-Item` and `Set-Content` to create `.bat` files with the content `\"dir\"` (e.g., `componente_secundario_script.bat`, `objeto_padrao_script.bat`). \n   - While creating scripts is normal, the **repetitive pattern** across **non-standard directories** (e.g., `C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum`, `C:\\registro_secundario\\unidade_secundario`) raises concerns about **automated or malicious scripting**.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - Files are created in **temporary or user-specific directories** (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`, `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`) and sometimes **deleted immediately** (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_lru3gbtr.1ce.ps1`). This could indicate **attempts to obfuscate activity** or **execute transient scripts**.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events (e.g., `RegistryEvent`) without clear context suggest **potential configuration changes**. While not inherently malicious, combined with file creation, this may indicate **post-exploitation activity** (e.g., setting persistence or modifying system behavior).\n\n4. **Unusual File Naming**:\n   - Files like `objeto_padrao_script.bat` and `componente_secundario_script.bat` use **non-standard naming conventions** that could be indicative of **malware-generated files** or **custom backdoors**.\n\n---\n\n### **Normal vs. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Normal**: \n  - PowerShell usage for scripting is common, and `ImageLoad` events for Windows Defender DLLs (`MpClient.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are legitimate.\n  - File creation in `AppData` or `Temp` directories can occur during normal operations (e.g., software updates, user scripts).\n- **Suspicious**:\n  - **Lack of clear purpose** for the created `.bat` files (e.g., why are they named with \"script.bat\" and filled with `\"dir\"`?).\n  - **Absence of user context** (e.g., no indication of user-initiated actions or legitimate software installation).\n  - **No network activity** or process execution logs (if this were a full log, missing context could be a gap).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for associated **network traffic**, **process execution**, or **user activity logs** to determine if these scripts are being run or if they interact with external resources.\n- **Analyze File Contents**: Inspect the created `.bat` files (e.g., `objeto_padrao_script.bat`) to confirm their purpose. If they contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code, this would confirm compromise.\n- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Investigate registry changes for **persistence keys** (e.g., Run keys, scheduled tasks) that could indicate long-term access.\n- **User Context**: Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) is a legitimate user or if this activity originated from a **compromised account**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the **unusual pattern of file creation, registry modifications, and PowerShell usage**. While not definitively malicious, these activities align with **malware behavior** (e.g., script deployment, obfuscation, persistence). Further analysis is required to confirm whether this represents a **security incident**."}

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, almost all of them are related to powershell.exe. That's common, but I need to check what they're doing. The command lines involve Test-Path checks for various .bat files. The paths have some odd patterns, like using \"..\\\" which is a parent directory reference. That might be a red flag because sometimes attackers use such paths to obfuscate or access files in unexpected locations.\n\nThen there are events about files being created and deleted, like the __PSScriptPolicyTest file. That could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but combined with the other events, maybe it's part of a larger activity. Also, some of the command lines have escaped quotes, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the command.\n\nThe winlog tasks include Process Create, Process Access, Image Load, File Create, and File Delete. The Image Loads are for .dll files, which are normal for PowerShell to use .NET components. However, the repeated Test-Path checks for .bat files in different directories might indicate that the attacker is checking for the existence of certain files, possibly to determine if a payload is present or to execute them.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple entries with Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. These might relate to PowerShell's own lifecycle events, but the repetition could be significant. Also, the paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands have a pattern where they're checking for .bat files in various directories, which might be part of a script that's trying to locate or execute files in a non-standard way.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or executing payloads. It's all about checking file existence and some standard PowerShell operations. But the combination of these events, especially the repeated Test-Path commands with obfuscated paths and the creation\/deletion of temporary files, might be indicative of something suspicious. \n\nI should also consider that some of these could be benign, like automated scripts or system checks. But the lack of clear benign context and the obfuscation techniques used (like escaped quotes and parent directory references) make this a potential candidate for further investigation. So, the answer would be that this is interesting because of the suspicious patterns, even if not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation, though no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Over **18 events** involve `powershell.exe`, with command lines using `Test-Path` to check for `.bat` and `.exe` files in obfuscated paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario\\objeto_ativo\\bin\\unidade_comum.exe`). \n   - Paths include **parent directory references** (`..\\\"`), which may be used to obscure the true location of files or bypass access controls.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This could indicate **script execution testing** or **payload cleanup**, common in malicious activity.\n\n3. **Obfuscation Techniques**:\n   - Escaped quotes (`\\\"`) and repetitive `Test-Path` checks suggest **attempts to evade detection** or obfuscate intent. The lack of clear purpose for these checks raises concerns.\n\n4. **Lack of Benign Context**:\n   - No events indicate legitimate system operations (e.g., software installation, updates). The repetitive nature of the commands and the absence of clear business logic (e.g., logging, configuration) lean toward **unusual behavior**.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual PowerShell usage**: Frequent `Test-Path` checks for executable files in non-standard directories.\n- **File manipulation**: Creation and deletion of temporary files, which may be part of **script execution chains** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **Path obfuscation**: Use of `..\\\"` and escaped characters could hint at **malware persistence** or **command-line obfuscation**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the **unusual PowerShell activity, obfuscation, and repetitive file checks**. While these behaviors could theoretically be part of legitimate scripts (e.g., automated testing), the lack of context and the suspicious patterns justify deeper analysis, such as:\n- Checking for additional network activity (e.g., outbound connections).\n- Inspecting the contents of the deleted temporary file (if recoverable).\n- Correlating with other system logs (e.g., registry changes, user activity).\n\n**Recommendation**: Flag for further triage and analysis by a security analyst."}

The user provided a bunch of log entries, mostly related to PowerShell.exe activities. My job is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are several \"Image loaded\" events for files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to the .NET Framework. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be part of a script's normal operation, but sometimes attackers create temporary files to execute malicious code.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several PowerShell commands that check if certain files exist and exit with 0 or 1. These could be benign checks, but in some contexts, they might be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of a payload or configuration file. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThere are also events about registry value changes and process access, which are common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes and various system files being accessed might be normal, but the repetition of certain events could indicate something. \n\nWait, the user mentioned analyzing the entire batch as a whole. The fact that there's a file created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Also, the multiple Image Load events for .NET files could be part of a normal PowerShell operation, but if combined with other suspicious activities, they might be a red flag. \n\nHowever, looking at all the events, they seem to be mostly routine operations. The temporary file creation and deletion is common in scripts. The repeated Process Access and Registry events might be due to PowerShell's normal functioning. There's no clear indication of a security breach here. \n\nSo, considering all events together, they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell processes running scripts that check if certain files exist. The command lines use Test-Path and exit based on that. But the paths mentioned are all in directories like C:\\estrutura_comum, C:\\tarefa_logico, etc. These look like they might be part of a project structure, maybe some development or testing environment. The fact that they're checking for specific .cs files and .ps1 scripts could be normal if they're part of an application's setup or deployment process.\n\nHowever, there's a pattern here. The same script structure is repeated multiple times, checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. Wait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious. That name might be associated with keylogging malware. But I need to check if that's the case here. The scripts are just checking if the file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. But why would that be interesting?\n\nAlso, there are events related to file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts to use temporary files. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes loading images from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll might be normal, as those are part of the antivirus. But the ImageLoad events are also present, which could be part of the normal operation of PowerShell.\n\nBut wait, the key thing here is that the same script, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, is being checked in multiple locations. If this script is malicious, the fact that the system is checking for its existence might indicate that it's being used or deployed. However, the logs don't show the actual execution of the script, just the checks. The classification here is tricky. The presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in the file paths could be a red flag, but without seeing the script's contents or actual execution, it's hard to confirm. However, the repetition of the same script name across different paths might be a sign of something intentional, possibly malicious activity. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user is running some automated tests or deployment scripts that check for the existence of these files. But the name Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is too specific and potentially harmful. Even if it's not executing, the mere presence of such a script name in multiple locations might warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, considering that, the logs do show multiple instances of checking for a script with a name that's commonly associated with malicious activity. Even though there's no direct execution event here, the pattern and the script name could be enough to flag this as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of files named `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across various directories. While the logs do not explicitly show execution of these scripts, the **repeated presence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** (a name commonly associated with keylogging malware) in multiple paths raises suspicion. \n\n### Key Indicators:\n1. **Suspicious Script Name**: `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` is a red flag, as it aligns with malicious activity (e.g., keystroke logging).\n2. **Repetition Across Paths**: The script is checked in multiple locations (`C:\\objeto_temporario\\...`, `C:\\tarefa_temporario\\...`, etc.), suggesting potential deployment or probing behavior.\n3. **No Clear Benign Context**: While PowerShell scripts can be legitimate, the lack of contextual clues (e.g., development\/testing environment details) and the script name make this pattern noteworthy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Interesting for investigation**. The logs warrant further analysis to confirm whether `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` exists on the system, its contents, and whether it is being executed. The repetition of the script name in multiple paths, combined with its potentially malicious connotation, justifies deeper scrutiny."}

The script exits 0 if the file exists, else 1. That seems suspicious because Get-Keystrokes.ps1 could be a keylogger, which is malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple PowerShell processes with tasks like ImageLoad, Registry value set, and ProcessAccess. Some files loaded are from Windows Defender, which is normal, but others are in temporary directories or involve script creation and deletion. For example, a file is created in the Temp folder and then immediately deleted, which is a common technique to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse might be probing the file system for sensitive information. Also, the presence of multiple Registry value set events could indicate changes to system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there are also normal activities like Chrome network connections and Notepad usage.

That's a normal-sounding name, maybe a text file. But why is PowerShell creating it? Sometimes PowerShell is used for legitimate tasks, but sometimes for malicious activities. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own data directory, a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's normal for it to create configuration files.
