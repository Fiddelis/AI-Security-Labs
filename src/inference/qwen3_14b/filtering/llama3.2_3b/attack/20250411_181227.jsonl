{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a bit suspicious because calc.exe is usually a benign application, but when combined with scheduled tasks, it might be a red flag. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a high privilege, so if an attacker is creating a scheduled task that runs as an administrator, that's definitely something to look into.\n\nThere are multiple entries with similar command lines, just different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"entrada_ativo\", \"pacote_logico\", etc. The repetition of these commands might indicate an automated script or multiple attempts to create these tasks. Also, the fact that they're all using the same structure suggests a pattern, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nNow, looking at other events, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in some attacks where malware is dropped temporarily. However, the file is named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... which might be related to PowerShell script execution. But since it's created and then deleted, it's a bit of a clue but not conclusive on its own.\n\nOther events mention image loads like mscoree.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, which are related to .NET runtime. That's normal for PowerShell scripts, but again, combined with the scheduled tasks, it might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nThere are also some entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks, but the process is None, which might be a placeholder or an error in logging. Not sure how significant that is, but it's worth noting.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with high privileges running calc.exe, which is unusual. Even though calc.exe itself isn't malicious, the context here is suspicious. The use of administrator rights and the repetition of these tasks could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system. The temporary file creation and deletion might be part of the process, but without more data, it's hard to tell. However, the scheduled tasks alone are a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of events seems worthy of further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repeated Scheduled Task Creation with High Privilege:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks that execute `calc.exe` with **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** privileges and **`RunLevel Highest`**. While `calc.exe` is benign, its use here is suspicious:\n     - **Persistence Mechanism:** Scheduled tasks running at logon with administrative rights could be part of an attacker's attempt to maintain access.\n     - **Lateral Movement:** High-privilege tasks may enable escalation or system-wide control.\n     - **Obfuscation:** The repetitive nature of task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `estrutura_auxiliar`) suggests automation or a script-driven attack.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is created and immediately deleted. This is a common tactic in attacks to:\n     - **Drop and Execute Malware:** The file might have been used to execute malicious code before being erased.\n     - **Avoid Detection:** Temporary files are often used to evade logging or forensic analysis.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads:**\n   - References to .NET components (e.g., `clrjit.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) are normal for PowerShell but may indicate **script-based attacks** or interaction with security tools (e.g., Windows Defender).\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution Logs:**\n   - Four entries with the task **\"Execute a Remote Command\"** (though no process details are logged) could indicate **external interaction** or exploitation attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- The **scheduled task creation** is the most critical red flag. Even if `calc.exe` is benign, the **high-privilege context** and **repetition** suggest an attacker is trying to **establish persistence** or **escalate privileges**.\n- The **temporary file** and **remote command logs** add context for potential **malware deployment** or **external communication**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps:**\n- **Investigate the source of the PowerShell scripts** (e.g., user accounts, network connections, or external repositories).\n- **Check system logs** for failed authentication attempts, unusual user activity, or other anomalies.\n- **Scan for malware** using endpoint detection tools (e.g., Windows Defender, third-party antivirus).\n- **Review permissions** on the system to ensure administrative tasks are not being abused.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of events is **highly suspicious** and requires immediate investigation. The combination of high-privilege scheduled tasks, temporary file activity, and remote command logs strongly suggests **malicious intent**."}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, as svchost is a system process that hosts various services. But then the next entry is svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Wait, System32\\Tasks is where scheduled tasks are stored. Creating a new task there might be a red flag. Maybe a malicious actor is adding a new task. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nNext, there are two entries with process None and task 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's odd. If the process is None, maybe the event is from a source that doesn't track the process, but executing a remote command without a known process could be suspicious. However, maybe it's a false positive or a log error. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData folder. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but the path mentioned is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Maybe it's a normal profile file. But sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities, so need to check if there's any other indicators.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, and MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender as well. So that seems normal. Then, Chrome.exe making registry changes. Maybe it's a browser extension modifying settings, but multiple registry changes could be suspicious if they're not expected.\n\nThe DNS query from Chrome.exe is normal for browsing. Then, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file in the Downloads directory might be part of installation or setup. But if it's a new installation, that's normal. However, if the user didn't initiate it, that could be an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious points are the svchost.exe creating a task in System32\\Tasks, which could be a scheduled task added by an attacker. The two remote command executions without a process might indicate something, but they could be errors. The rest seems normal. However, the presence of a new task in a system directory is a high-risk indicator. Also, the other events don't show obvious malicious activity. So, the batch is interesting because of the potential unauthorized task creation. Confidence is medium because while that event is suspicious, without more context, it's not certain. But the presence of that single event is enough to flag it for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity including svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows System32\\\\Tasks directory (potential malicious task scheduling), multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process, and PowerShell creating a startup profile file in a non-standard location. These combined indicators suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
