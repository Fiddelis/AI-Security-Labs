So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is normal. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Some of them have commands that look suspicious, like using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various file types. That's a red flag because searching for passwords in files could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information.\n\nNext, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, which might be normal, but when combined with other activities, could be part of a larger attack. The creation and deletion of temporary files in the AppData directory might be part of a script trying to execute something without leaving traces. The Pipe Created event could be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nThere's also a DNS query for OfficeClickToRun.exe, which could be related to software updates, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords and the creation of temporary files suggest that someone might be trying to find and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry events and image loads might indicate that the attacker is trying to modify system settings or inject code. However, some of these could be legitimate, like the .NET DLLs being loaded as part of normal PowerShell operations.

The key indicators are the PowerShell commands searching for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the multiple image loads. However, without more context or additional malicious activities, it's not definitive. So maybe around 0.75 confidence.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing normal activities like registry changes, DNS queries, and network connections. That's common, but I need to check for anomalies. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if it's part of a log collection process, but I should note it.\n\nWait, there's also powershell.exe and cmd.exe executing commands. The cmd.exe entries include deleting scheduled tasks, which could be part of cleanup, but sometimes attackers use that to remove their own tasks. The schtasks.exe commands are deleting tasks named things like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". Those names are a bit generic, but not obviously malicious. However, the use of schtasks to delete tasks might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother thing is the whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign, just checking the user. But combined with other commands, maybe it's part of a larger script. Also, the ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the file creation by winlogbeat.exe, that's a log shipper, so maybe it's normal. But if there's a lot of file creation or unusual paths, that's a concern. However, in this case, the path seems to be a standard .yml.new file for configuration.\n\nThe repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe might be normal, but if there's a lot of them, maybe something's modifying the registry. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The DNS queries and network connections are common, but again, need to check for unusual domains or IPs.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some suspicious activities like deleting scheduled tasks, process access attempts, and multiple registry changes. However, many of these could be part of normal operations or benign scripts. The presence of multiple cmd and powershell commands might indicate automated tasks or potential malicious activity. But without more context, like unusual command lines or unexpected network traffic, it's a bit ambiguous. I think this warrants further investigation, especially looking into the specific commands executed by cmd and powershell, and checking if the scheduled tasks being deleted are related to legitimate processes or if they're part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity Highlighted**\n1. **Scheduled Task Deletion**:\n   - Multiple `schtasks.exe` and `cmd.exe` commands attempt to delete scheduled tasks with names like `\"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\"` and `\"registro_base_005_OnStartup\"`. While task deletion is normal, **the lack of context** (e.g., why these tasks are being deleted) raises concerns. Attackers often delete malicious tasks to avoid detection, but this could also be part of a legitimate cleanup process.\n\n2. **Process Manipulation**:\n   - `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` are involved in **process access** (`ProcessAccess` events) and **deletion of processes** (e.g., `wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete`). This could indicate **attempts to terminate processes** or **inspect\/modify running processes**, which may be part of reconnaissance or evasion tactics.\n\n3. **Command-Line Activity**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` command runs:  \n     ```bash\n     schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" \/f >nul 2>&1 & schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\" \/f >nul 2>&1\n     ```  \n     This script deletes tasks silently (`>nul 2>&1`), which is **unusual** unless explicitly justified by the system administrator.\n\n4. **Repeated Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events by `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `chrome.exe`. While registry changes are normal, **frequent or unexplained modifications** could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Benign or Normal Activity**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**:  \n  Creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory is consistent with **log configuration updates** (e.g., for Elastic Stack agents). This is likely legitimate unless the file contains unexpected content.\n- **`whoami.exe` Execution**:  \n  A standard tool for checking the current user identity, commonly used in scripts.\n- **`chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe` Activity**:  \n  DNS queries, network connections, and registry changes by these processes are typical for browser and scripting tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:  \n   - Check if the deleted scheduled tasks (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, etc.) were previously associated with malicious activity (e.g., via threat intelligence or historical logs).\n   - Investigate the **source of the commands** (e.g., user accounts, scripts, or external triggers).\n\n2. **Analyze File Content**:  \n   - Examine the `winlogbeat.yml.new` file for anomalies (e.g., unexpected configurations, IP addresses, or credentials).\n\n3. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:  \n   - The use of `wmic` to delete processes (`notepad.exe`) could indicate **attempts to terminate forensic tools** or **hide malicious activity**.\n\n4. **Check for Privilege Escalation**:  \n   - The `schtasks` and `cmd` commands may require elevated privileges. Verify if the user executing these commands has **unnecessary administrative rights**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `winlogbeat` file creation, `whoami` execution) is benign, the **combination of task deletion, process manipulation, and silent command execution** suggests **potential malicious intent** or **unusual system behavior**. Further analysis of context, user accounts, and file content is required to determine if this is a security incident or a legitimate process. **This batch is flagged as \"interesting\" for investigation.**"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of WMIC.exe loading DLLs. Specifically, amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Now, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is related to Microsoft Defender's real-time protection. Typically, these DLLs are legitimate, but if they're being loaded by WMIC.exe, that might be unusual. WMIC is often used by attackers for command execution, so this could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Commands like net user \/del are being used to delete user accounts, which is suspicious. The presence of multiple process creations for cmd and powershell, especially with commands that modify user accounts and delete services (like sc delete win32times), suggests someone is trying to remove traces of their activity or modify system configurations.\n\nAlso, there are several Registry value set events. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by attackers. The fact that conhost.exe and other system processes are involved in these registry changes adds to the suspicion.\n\nAnother point is the use of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool. The command line includes deleting user accounts, which is out of the ordinary. Additionally, the deletion of files in the temp directory might be an attempt to clean up after malicious activities.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these activities are part of normal system operations. For example, user account management and service deletions could be legitimate if done by administrators. But the combination of these actions with the use of WMIC, unusual processes, and registry modifications without clear justification points towards a potential security incident. The repeated use of cmd and powershell with specific deletion commands, along with the loading of Defender-related DLLs by WMIC, makes me think this might be a malware or attack scenario. I need to consider if there's any legitimate reason for these actions, but given the context, it's more likely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **suspicious activity** that may be associated with **malicious behavior** or **post-compromise activity**. Here's a structured analysis of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **WMIC.exe Loading DLLs**:\n  - **`amsi.dll`** (Windows Defender Antimalware Scan Interface) and **`MpOAV.dll`** (Microsoft Defender Antivirus) are loaded by **WMIC.exe**. \n  - **Why this is suspicious**: \n    - These DLLs are typically loaded by legitimate system processes (e.g., Defender services). \n    - **WMIC.exe** is often abused by attackers for remote code execution, lateral movement, or persistence. This combination could indicate an **attempt to bypass security mechanisms** or **tamper with Defender components**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. User Account and Service Manipulation**\n- **Deletion of User Accounts**:\n  - Multiple instances of **`net user \/del`** and **`net1.exe \/del \/domain`** commands are observed. \n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - Deleting user accounts (e.g., `modulo_auxiliar_Admin`, `tarefa_padrao_Admin`) could be an attempt to **remove evidence of unauthorized access** or **eliminate compromised accounts**.\n    - The use of **`\/domain`** suggests this may be part of a **domain-wide attack** (e.g., lateral movement or privilege escalation).\n\n- **Deletion of Services**:\n  - **`sc delete win32times`** is executed via **`cmd.exe`** and **`sc.exe`**.\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - Deleting services (e.g., `win32times`) may be an attempt to **remove malicious services** or **disable legitimate services** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Deletion and Cleanup**\n- **File Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n  - Commands like **`del %temp%\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt`** and **`del %temp%\\estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe`** are executed.\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - This suggests **cleanup of malicious payloads** or **log files** after execution, a common tactic to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Registry Value Set Events**:\n  - Multiple entries involving **`Registry value set`** by **`cmd.exe`**, **`powershell.exe`**, and **`services.exe`**.\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - Registry changes are often used for **persistence** (e.g., adding startup entries) or **disabling security features**. The lack of clear context for these changes raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Use of Non-Standard Tools**\n- **`net1.exe`** (not a standard Windows tool):\n  - Used with **`net user \/del`** commands. This could be a **dropped malicious binary** or a **repackaged legitimate tool** for obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Whoami.exe Usage**\n- **`whoami.exe`** is executed multiple times.\n  - **Why this is suspicious**:\n    - While `whoami` is a legitimate tool, its repeated use could indicate **privilege escalation checks** or **reconnaissance** (e.g., confirming the current user context).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n| **Indicator**               | **Type**       | **Likelihood** |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| WMIC.exe loading amsi.dll   | Process Behavior | High           |\n| Deletion of user accounts   | Command Line   | High           |\n| Deletion of services        | Command Line   | Medium         |\n| File deletion in %temp%     | File Activity  | Medium         |\n| Registry modifications      | System Event   | Medium         |\n| Use of net1.exe             | Process        | Medium         |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate WMIC.exe Activity**:\n   - Check for **unauthorized remote connections** or **code execution** via WMIC.\n   - Monitor for **tampering with amsi.dll** or **disabling Defender**.\n\n2. **Audit User Account Changes**:\n   - Review **domain user account deletions** for unauthorized activity.\n   - Check **Event Logs (4722, 4726)** for account creation\/deletion events.\n\n3. **Analyze File Deletion Patterns**:\n   - Use **SIEM tools** to correlate **file deletion** with **malicious payload execution**.\n\n4. **Investigate Registry Changes**:\n   - Use **registry forensics** to identify **unusual startup entries** or **disabled security policies**.\n\n5. **Block Suspicious Tools**:\n   - Add **`net1.exe`** to **endpoint protection** rules to prevent execution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest **post-compromise activity** (e.g., cleanup, privilege escalation) or **malware execution**. Immediate investigation of **WMIC.exe behavior**, **user account deletions**, and **registry changes** is critical to determine the scope of the incident and prevent further lateral movement."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}' and winlog task 'Provider Lifecycle'. Hmm, the 'Provider Lifecycle' task might be related to some system provider activity, but I'm not sure yet. Also, the same command_line repeated several times could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign script, but repetition might indicate something automated or malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where powershell.exe loads 'mscoree.dll' and other .NET related DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but then there's a load of 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. Wait, those are legitimate Defender files, so maybe that's just normal operation. However, the presence of multiple image loads from different paths might be okay if they're part of a legitimate process.\n\nThen there's a file deletion event for a temporary script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1'. Deleting a temporary script could be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern of obfuscation or cleanup, that might be suspicious. However, alone, it's not conclusive.\n\nThere are also multiple process creations of 'whoami.exe' and 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe'. 'whoami.exe' is a standard utility to check user context, so that's normal. 'calc.exe' is just the calculator, but the image loaded 'urlmon.dll' is part of Internet Explorer, which is normal for some operations. However, if these processes are being created in an unusual context, that could be a problem.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' events are about file creation, which seems like part of a log collection tool. That's probably legitimate unless there's something else.\n\nNow, looking at the tasks: 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' might be part of some system or application's normal lifecycle, but I need to check if they're being used here in a way that's not typical. Also, the 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the registry, which could be benign or malicious depending on the key and value.\n\nThe repetition of the same command_line for powershell.exe multiple times might indicate a script that's being run repeatedly, which could be a sign of a loop or an attempt to evade detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several PowerShell events, some registry changes, and normal system processes. However, the repetition of the same command_line and the deletion of a temporary script might be worth investigating. But are these enough to consider it interesting? Maybe, but I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The presence of 'whoami.exe' multiple times might be part of a legitimate script checking user rights, but if it's being used in a way that's not typical, that could be a problem.\n\nOverall, while there are some unusual patterns, they might not be conclusive on their own. However, the combination of repeated PowerShell commands and some file operations could be indicative of something that needs further investigation. So, I'd lean towards saying this is interesting enough to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activity and patterns that could warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` with the command line `powershell.exe & {}` and Winlog tasks like **\"Provider Lifecycle\"** or **\"Engine Lifecycle\"**. \n   - **Why it matters:** The repetition of the same command line could indicate a looped script, obfuscation, or an attempt to evade detection. While benign scripts might repeat commands, this pattern could also be a red flag for malicious activity (e.g., persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration).\n\n2. **File Deletion of a Temporary Script:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1`) is deleted. \n   - **Why it matters:** Deleting temporary files is normal, but if this occurs in conjunction with other suspicious activity (e.g., script execution, registry changes), it might indicate cleanup after a malicious operation.\n\n3. **Legitimate System Processes:**\n   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are present. These are typically benign, but their presence alone is not suspicious unless tied to anomalous behavior (e.g., unexpected execution paths, elevated privileges).\n\n4. **Windows Defender DLLs Loaded:**\n   - PowerShell loads `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender components). This is normal for system processes but could be exploited in advanced attacks (e.g., DLL hijacking).\n\n5. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple **\"Registry value set\"** events are logged. While registry changes are common, they could indicate configuration changes, persistence mechanisms, or malware tampering.\n\n6. **Winlogbeat File Creation:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`), which is expected behavior for a log shipper. This is likely legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not show clear evidence of malware or active attacks, but the **repeated PowerShell commands** and **registry modifications** could indicate a need for deeper analysis.\n- **No direct evidence of compromise** (e.g., network connections, unauthorized access, or known malicious hashes).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for associated network traffic, user activity, or file modifications (e.g., does the deleted script file exist elsewhere?).\n   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell commands (e.g., user-initiated, scheduled task, or remote execution).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - If the temporary script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is recoverable, analyze its contents for obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit the specific registry keys modified to determine if they align with legitimate system changes or suspicious configurations.\n\n4. **Check User Context:**\n   - Verify if the processes were executed under unexpected user accounts (e.g., elevated privileges, service accounts).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not confirm a security incident, the **repeated PowerShell activity** and **registry changes** are **suspicious enough to warrant further investigation**. This could be a false positive (e.g., a benign script) or an early indicator of a more complex threat. Prioritize correlating these events with additional telemetry (e.g., network logs, file integrity monitoring). \n\n**Verdict:** 🟡 **Interesting – Requires Further Analysis**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL events, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the events. There are six entries here. Let's break them down. The first two are about 'powershell.exe' with the task 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)'. Then there's 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' with a registry value set. The next three are 'chrome.exe' with network connections detected.\n\nHmm, so what's suspicious here? Well, PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. But just having it accessed twice might not be enough. The registry event for ApplicationFrameHost.exe—maybe that's normal? Not sure. Chrome having multiple network connections could be normal too, like browsing. But maybe if there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, but all the events are from different processes, and none of them seem to be obviously malicious. The same process being accessed multiple times might be normal. For example, Chrome making multiple network connections is typical. PowerShell being accessed twice could be part of normal operations. The registry event might be a standard change. Without more context, like unusual parameters, unexpected users, or other indicators of compromise, these events alone don't seem to form a clear pattern of malicious activity.\n\nSo, maybe the classification is NOT INTERESTING. The justification would be that the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. Confidence might be around 0.6, but maybe lower. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Are there any red flags? For example, if the same process is accessing files or registry keys that are suspicious. But in this case, the 'file' field is None for all, and the registry event is just a value set. Without more info, it's hard to say. So, maybe the confidence is medium, but the classification is not interesting because there's no clear evidence of a threat here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show common system activities (e.g., Chrome network connections, PowerShell process access) without unusual patterns or indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
