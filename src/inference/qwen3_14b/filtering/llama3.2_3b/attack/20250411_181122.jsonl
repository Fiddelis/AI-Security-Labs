{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: there's a powershell.exe process running with a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find password-related information in files. That's a red flag because it could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive data.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's just normal operation. But combined with the PowerShell activity, it might not be a big deal on its own.\n\nNext, there's a File Created event for a temporary PowerShell script in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. Creating temporary scripts can be normal, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event and some Provider Lifecycle events related to PowerShell. These might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but again, the presence of multiple similar events could be worth checking.\n\nLooking further, there's a findstr.exe process running with the same command line as the PowerShell one. That's the same search for passwords in files. This reinforces the idea that someone is trying to find password information.\n\nThen there are some events related to winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is a log shipper. That might be part of normal logging, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. However, the user hasn't mentioned any other anomalies here.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which just shows the current user. That's a common command, so not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe Chrome events include registry changes and network connections, but without more info, they don't stand out as suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious part is the repeated use of PowerShell and findstr to search for passwords in files. That's a common technique used in data exfiltration or reconnaissance. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities might indicate an attacker trying to find sensitive information. The fact that multiple processes are involved in searching for passwords could be a sign of a security incident. So, this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for 'password' in files (e.g., *.xml, *.doc) across directories, combined with temporary file creation and system DLL loading, suggests potential data reconnaissance or exfiltration activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of process creation events here. Let me scan through them.\n\nFirst, I see powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used. Some of the commands look suspicious. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be normal, but combined with other actions, it could be part of a larger plan.\n\nThen there's a schtasks.exe process deleting another task called \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Also, there's a wmic process deleting notepad.exe processes. That seems odd because why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe they're trying to remove a legitimate process or replace it with something malicious.\n\nLooking at the image loads, WMIC.exe is loading dlls like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, so loading that might be a red flag if it's being used in an unexpected way. Also, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for WMIC could indicate that it's being used to execute commands or bypass security measures.\n\nThere's a net.exe command deleting a user named \"componente_comum_Admin\" and another net1.exe command deleting \"tarefa_padrao_Admin\" on a domain. Deleting user accounts is a significant action and could be part of an attack to remove access or cover tracks.\n\nThe file delete event for \"tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\" in the Temp directory might be an attempt to remove evidence after executing a malicious file. The use of temporary directories for such files is common in malware to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe could indicate that the process is being manipulated or monitored. The Registry value set events might be changing configurations or disabling security features.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple suspicious activities: deleting scheduled tasks, deleting user accounts, using wmic to delete processes, loading potentially malicious dlls, and deleting temporary files. These actions could be indicative of an attacker trying to clean up after deploying malware or maintaining persistence. The combination of these events across different processes and system components makes this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks, user account deletion, use of WMIC to delete processes, loading of potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), and deletion of temporary files.

So the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: conhost.exe with a registry value set. Conhost is a normal Windows process, part of the console host, so that's probably legitimate. Then there's whoami.exe being created, which is a standard command to get user info. That's normal too. Then powershell.exe appears multiple times with various tasks. \n\nWait, there are several entries with powershell.exe and \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be part of PowerShell's normal operations, but I should check if they're suspicious. Also, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script file. Creating a script in Temp could be a red flag if it's not expected. \n\nLooking at the image loaded events: mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. The first is part of the .NET framework, which is normal. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender, so that's also legitimate. But then there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used for persistence. \n\nThere are multiple process creates for whoami.exe, which is normal but repeated might be part of testing or malicious activity. However, the logs don't show any unusual command-line arguments beyond the standard. \n\nThe repeated \"Process accessed\" events for powershell.exe might indicate someone is interacting with the process, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the creation of temporary script files could be part of a benign script execution, but it's also a common tactic in attacks. \n\nHowever, there's no evidence of malicious activity here like downloading files from suspicious sources, executing unknown scripts, or accessing sensitive files. The events seem to be mostly legitimate system processes and normal PowerShell operations. The only thing that stands out is the creation of the .ps1 file in Temp, but if it's part of a legitimate script, that's okay. \n\nSo, considering all these points, there's no clear indication of a security threat. The events are mostly normal system activities. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system activity with no clear indicators of compromise. PowerShell operations, registry modifications, and process creation are consistent with typical user behavior and system processes. No malicious artifacts or suspicious patterns are present.\"\n}"}

The first one is whoami.exe being executed, which is a normal Windows command to get the current user. The second is powershell.exe being accessed, which isn't unusual on its own. The third is chrome.exe making a DNS query, which is typical for a browser. None of these processes are inherently malicious. There's no indication of suspicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual command-line arguments, or access to sensitive files. All the events seem to be part of regular user behavior. So, I don't see anything here that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system behavior: whoami.exe is a standard Windows utility, powershell.exe access is common, and chrome.exe DNS queries are typical for a browser.
