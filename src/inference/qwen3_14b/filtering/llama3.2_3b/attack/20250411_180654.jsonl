The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to look for any suspicious patterns or activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. Let me check the specific events.\n\nThe first event is a file creation by powershell.exe at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt'. That might be normal, but I'll keep an eye on it. Then there are several registry value set events from chrome.exe. Not sure if that's suspicious yet, but maybe part of normal operations.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is typically used to get the current user's identity. That's a standard command, so probably not a red flag. However, the next event is a process accessed by powershell.exe, which is normal but not alarming on its own.\n\nNow, looking at the command lines for powershell.exe, there's a recurring pattern: executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. The script paths are all over different directories, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the location. The fact that the same script is being called multiple times from different paths could be suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information, so that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. While loading Defender DLLs might be normal, the frequency and context here might be worth checking. However, the main concern here is the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is likely part of a keystroke logging attack.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file deletion event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting the script after execution could be an attempt to remove evidence, which is suspicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to run keystroke logging scripts from various paths, combined with the deletion of temporary files, suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points towards an investigation being necessary.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. The same script is called from numerous obfuscated paths, and temporary files are deleted afterward, suggesting evasion techniques. Windows Defender DLLs are loaded, but the repeated suspicious script executions warrant investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event has a process running PowerShell with a command line that includes a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The script is located in a path that seems a bit suspicious: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\. The script is logging keystrokes to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with keyloggers, which are malicious. The winlog task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I'm not too familiar with, but the file is mentioned as None. \n\nThe second event has a file created at C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The process is None, and the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. The same script name appears here again. The fact that the script is being created in a different path but with the same name might indicate that it's being deployed or executed remotely. This could be part of a malicious activity, especially since the previous event had the same script being run.\n\nThird event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs, so this might be normal. The file is a .yml.new, which could be part of a configuration update. Not suspicious here.\n\nFourth event: PowerShell creating a file called pacote_temporario.txt. PowerShell is common, but the name of the file is in Portuguese, which might be benign. Unless there's more context, this alone might not be a concern.\n\nFifth event: svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, and the file is related to Delivery Optimization, which is a legitimate feature. So this seems normal.\n\nNow, looking at the first two events again. Both involve the same script, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is used for logging keystrokes. The first event is executing it, the second is creating the file. The presence of this script in different directories and the execution via PowerShell could be part of a malware installation. The fact that the script is being created and executed might be part of a larger attack, like installing a keylogger. The other events don't show any signs of malicious activity, but the first two are suspicious. Since the classification is based on the entire batch, and there are two events that point to potential malicious activity, the batch is interesting. The justification would be the presence of the keylogger script and the remote command execution.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events involving the execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' (a known keystroke logging script) via PowerShell, combined with a file creation event for the same script under a suspicious path, suggesting potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}
