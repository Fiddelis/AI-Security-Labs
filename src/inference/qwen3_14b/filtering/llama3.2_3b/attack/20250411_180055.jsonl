{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not suspicious on its own. Then there's a powershell.exe process creating an archive using Compress-Archive. That's a legitimate command, but maybe the paths are odd? The paths have a lot of nested directories with names like 'elemento_padrao' and 'objeto_secundario', which seem like they could be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious activity. However, just creating a zip file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. That's normal if PowerShell is using .NET assemblies. Then a file is created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for scripts that generate temporary files, but could be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks. However, the deletion is logged, which might be normal behavior.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are multiple instances of Compress-Archive being used with different paths. The repetition of similar commands might indicate automation or a script that's being run multiple times. The paths mentioned are all within 'bin' directories, which might be part of a normal build process, but again, the obfuscation of directory names is a red flag.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is part of the ELK stack for logging. That's probably just a monitoring tool. The notepad.exe and calc.exe events are standard applications, but the registry change by notepad.exe might be benign unless it's changing critical keys. The calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal for Internet Explorer, but again, not suspicious unless there's other activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious points are the repeated use of Compress-Archive with obfuscated paths and the temporary file creation\/deletion. However, without more context like network activity, unusual processes, or unexpected execution paths, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The events could be part of a legitimate script or build process. But the combination of these factors might warrant further investigation to rule out potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **`whoami.exe`**: A standard command to retrieve user context.\n2. **PowerShell `Compress-Archive`**: Legitimate use of PowerShell for archiving files, though the repetitive nature of the commands (e.g., multiple `Compress-Archive` calls with obfuscated paths) could indicate automation or script-based workflows.\n3. **.NET Assembly Loads (`clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`)**: Expected when PowerShell interacts with .NET frameworks.\n4. **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**: Likely part of log monitoring tools (ELK stack), which is benign.\n5. **`notepad.exe` and `calc.exe`**: Standard applications with no immediate signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Obfuscated Paths**:\n   - Repeated use of `Compress-Archive` with paths like `C:\\componente_secundario\\registro_geral\\registro_ativo\\bin\\tarefa_ativo` suggests **obfuscation** of directory names. This could be an attempt to hide the true purpose of the files or evade detection.\n   - The nested structure and non-descriptive names (e.g., `elemento_padrao`, `objeto_secundario`) are inconsistent with typical user or developer workflows.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A file is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` and later deleted. While common in scripts, the **immediate deletion** might indicate an attempt to **avoid leaving traces** of temporary files.\n\n3. **Repetitive `Compress-Archive` Commands**:\n   - The same `Compress-Archive` command is executed multiple times with different paths, possibly part of a **script or automated process**. This could be legitimate (e.g., backup routines) but merits scrutiny to rule out **data exfiltration** or **malicious payload packaging**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Data Exfiltration**: If the archives contain sensitive data, the repetitive compression could be a method to **package and transfer files**.\n- **Malware Obfuscation**: The obfuscated paths and repetitive commands might be part of a **malicious script** designed to evade detection.\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: The use of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` could hint at **persistent execution** or **script-based persistence**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Network Activity**: Check if the compressed files are being transmitted to external IPs or domains.\n2. **Analyze File Contents**: Inspect the contents of the archives (if accessible) for malicious payloads or unexpected data.\n3. **Monitor User Behavior**: Investigate the user (`fiddelis`) for other anomalous activities (e.g., privilege escalation, unauthorized access).\n4. **Check for PowerShell Scripting**: Review PowerShell logs for signs of **script obfuscation** or **unusual command chains**.\n5. **Verify Legitimacy of Tools**: Ensure `winlogbeat.exe` and other tools are authorized and configured correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is benign, the combination of **obfuscated paths**, **repetitive compression**, and **temporary file handling** raises **moderate risk**. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether this represents **legitimate automation** or **malicious behavior**."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll from the System32 directory. That seems normal because urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows system file used for URL handling. No red flags there.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be suspicious, but Chrome might modify its own settings. However, the same event repeating four times in a short period could indicate something automated or potentially malicious, like a script trying to alter registry keys. But I need to check if there's any harmful action here. The files involved are not mentioned, so maybe it's just Chrome updating its own settings. Still, repeated registry changes might be worth looking into.\n\nAnother event shows chrome.exe loading MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. MpOAV.dll is part of Microsoft Defender, so that's legitimate. No issues there.\n\nThen there's a Process accessed event for powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, without more context like command-line arguments or unusual process behavior, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious. The event just mentions process access, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together: The most notable thing is the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. While Chrome can modify the registry, repeated events might indicate something unusual. However, without more context like unexpected registry keys being changed or other malicious activities, it's not conclusive. The other events involve legitimate processes and files. So, this might be a low-priority alert, but not highly suspicious. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.5. Justification would be the repeated registry modifications by Chrome, but no clear evidence of malicious activity yet.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (Calculator.exe, Chrome.exe, PowerShell.exe) and system files (urlmon.dll, MpOAV.dll). Repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe are inconclusive without additional context (e.g., specific registry keys modified). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.5\n}"}
