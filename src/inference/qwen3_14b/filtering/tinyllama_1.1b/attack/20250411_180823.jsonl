{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. Then RuntimeBroker.exe changing registry values. Not sure yet. Notepad.exe also changing registryâ€”maybe user activity, but not necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing a process. Hmm, PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also common for legitimate scripts. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file, but loading it from calc.exe might be normal? Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. The command line shows creating tasks that run calc.exe on logon and startup. That's suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with system privileges (like \/ru system) could be a sign of persistence. Also, the task names have random-looking names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" which might be obfuscated.\n\nAnother entry is schtasks.exe creating a task named \"pacote_secundario_005_OnLogon\" which runs calc.exe. Creating tasks with such names and using cmd.exe to launch calc.exe might be part of an attack to maintain access. Also, the file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon is a scheduled task, which is a common method for persistence.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. That's not necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be. However, the main red flags here are the scheduled tasks being created with system-level permissions and the use of calc.exe, which is a simple calculator but often used in attacks as a payload.\n\nThe other entries involve chrome.exe and svchost.exe doing registry changes and image loads. Chrome's activities seem normal. Svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but multiple registry changes might be part of something else.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with system privileges, the use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to set up these tasks, and the presence of calc.exe being run on logon\/startup are indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination here suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system. That makes this batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with system-level permissions (e.g., 'elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon' and 'unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup'), use of cmd.exe to execute calc.exe persistently, and unexpected registry modifications by non-system processes. These patterns suggest potential malicious persistence mechanisms.\"\n}"}
