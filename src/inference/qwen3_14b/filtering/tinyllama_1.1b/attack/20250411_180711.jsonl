{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a chrome.exe process with a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then powershell.exe is accessed a few times. Not unusual on its own, but maybe in combination with other events.\n\nLooking at the third event, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's doing some encryption. The script is taking a plaintext string, XOR encrypting it with a key, and then sending it via a POST request to example.com. That seems suspicious because XOR encryption is a simple method, and sending data to a remote server might be exfiltration. Also, the path mentioned is C:\\Users\\victim, which could be a red flag if the user is a victim.\n\nThen there are multiple image loads for powershell.exe, including some .NET DLLs and a Windows Defender DLL. Loading those might be normal, but combined with the encryption script, it could indicate something malicious. The FileCreate event for a temporary script file might be part of the attack, trying to execute or store malicious code.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle events with the same command line might indicate that the script is being run multiple times, possibly to maintain persistence or continue exfiltrating data. Also, the use of -bxor and the custom encryption suggests an attempt to obfuscate the data being sent, which is common in malware.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be related to log collection, but if it's in the Downloads folder and named with a .yml.new, it could be a configuration file that's part of a setup, but not necessarily malicious. However, combined with the other PowerShell activities, it's worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell script is encrypting data and sending it to a remote server, which is a common tactic in data exfiltration. The multiple image loads and file creation events could be part of establishing a foothold or persistence. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these activities points towards potential malicious behavior. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell processes executing obfuscated XOR-based encryption of user path data followed by HTTP POST exfiltration to example.com, combined with multiple image loads of .NET and Defender DLLs, suggesting potential malicious activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first entry stands out because it's a PowerShell command that's doing some encryption. The command line shows they're taking a plaintext string, which includes a path like \"C:\\Users\\victim\", and XORing it with a key. Then they're sending the encrypted data to example.com using Invoke-WebRequest. That seems suspicious because encrypting data and sending it to an external server could be part of exfiltrating sensitive information.\n\nOther events involve normal processes like Chrome and Notepad, and some registry changes. But the key thing here is the first event. The PowerShell script is manipulating files and sending data over the network, which might indicate malicious activity. Even though there are other events, they don't show the same level of suspicious behavior. The rest are either standard operations or unrelated. So the batch is interesting because of that first event.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event contains a PowerShell script that encrypts a path string (including 'C:\\\\Users\\\\victim') using XOR and sends the result to example.com, suggesting potential data exfiltration.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe with registry value set events. Chrome doing registry changes might be normal, but repeated entries could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe part of an update or extension?\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with various tasks. The first one is an image loaded from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender is a trusted process. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named something like __PSScriptPolicyTest... That's a bit odd. Temporary files are common, but the name suggests it might be related to script testing. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be part of a normal script execution, but sometimes attackers create and delete files quickly to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several entries where powershell.exe is used to remove various .bat files across different directories. The command lines show Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. The paths have a pattern with \"..\\\" which might indicate moving up directories, but the exact purpose isn't clear. However, repeatedly deleting files, especially if they're scripts, could be part of cleaning up after an attack.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event for powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which isn't inherently malicious but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother entry shows the image loaded from MpClient.dll, which again is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably okay. The whoami.exe command is just checking the user, which is normal. The cmd.exe processes stopping and deleting services (sc.exe stop and delete) could be concerning. Stopping and deleting services might be part of disabling security software or other services to avoid detection. The command line here is using sc.exe to stop and delete services, which could be a sign of someone trying to tamper with system services.\n\nThere are also multiple Process accessed events for powershell.exe, which might indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which can be normal but might also be part of a more complex attack.\n\nPutting this all together: the presence of PowerShell doing file deletions, especially with those paths, combined with stopping services, might indicate someone trying to remove evidence or disable security features. The temporary files being created and deleted could be part of executing scripts. However, some of these actions could be legitimate, like scripts running during normal operations. But the combination of these events, especially the service manipulation and file deletions, raises suspicion. It's not definitive proof of an attack, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd say this batch is interesting and should be looked into more.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity**\n1. **PowerShell File Deletion**:\n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` executing `Remove-Item` commands to delete `.bat` files across various directories (e.g., `objeto_temporario`, `estrutura_secundario`). \n   - The use of `-Force` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` suggests an attempt to suppress errors or avoid detection during cleanup.\n   - **Risk**: This could indicate post-exploitation activity (e.g., removing evidence of malicious scripts or tools).\n\n2. **Service Manipulation**:\n   - A `cmd.exe` process runs `sc.exe stop` and `sc.exe delete` commands to stop and delete services (`objeto_temporario`, `estrutura_secundario`). \n   - **Risk**: Disabling or stopping services may aim to evade detection (e.g., halting security software or logging services).\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process creates a temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) in the user's Temp directory and immediately deletes it.\n   - **Risk**: This pattern is common in malware or scripts designed to execute payloads without leaving persistent traces.\n\n4. **Process Access and Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` events and `Registry value set` actions involving `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` suggest lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n   - **Risk**: Unusual registry changes or process interactions could signal tampering with system integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**\n- **Windows Defender Modules**: \n  - `MpOAV.dll` and `MpClient.dll` are legitimate components of Windows Defender. Their loading is expected during antivirus operations.\n- **Whoami.exe**: \n  - The `whoami.exe` command is a standard tool for checking user context and is not inherently malicious.\n- **Chrome and System Processes**:\n  - Registry modifications by `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `services.exe` may relate to normal operations (e.g., updates, UI rendering).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**This batch of logs is suspicious and merits further investigation.** The combination of:\n- **File deletion via PowerShell**,\n- **Service manipulation**,\n- **Temporary file cleanup**, and\n- **Unusual registry\/process interactions**\n\nsuggests potential adversarial activity (e.g., post-exploitation cleanup, evasion techniques). However, some actions (e.g., Windows Defender modules) are legitimate. A deeper analysis of:\n- **File hashes** of deleted `.bat` files (if recoverable),\n- **User context** of PowerShell\/cmd.exe processes,\n- **Correlation with other logs** (e.g., network activity, user behavior),\n- **Timeline analysis** (e.g., when services were deleted),\n\nis necessary to determine if this represents a true security incident."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a normal command to get user info, so maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' being used. PowerShell is common, but sometimes used for malicious scripts. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the 'cmd.exe' event, there's a command to delete a file: \"del \/A:H %temp%\\\\tarefa_logico.txt\". Deleting a hidden file in the temp directory might be part of cleanup, but could be suspicious if it's part of a larger attack. However, just deleting a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a 'powershell.exe' with a command line that's just \"{}\", which is an empty script block. That might be a placeholder or a test. But there are multiple instances of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might relate to logging or monitoring tools. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, looking at the file events. There's a file created at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this could be part of legitimate monitoring. However, another file is deleted: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\modulo_base.exe'. Deleting a temp file might be normal, but if it's part of a malicious payload, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's a 'File created' event for 'tarefa_comum.txt' in the downloads folder. Not sure if that's malicious, but again, depends on context.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some are standard like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET. However, 'MpOAV.dll' is from Windows Defender, which might be normal. But if there's unexpected loading of DLLs, that could be a sign of something.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: multiple process creations, registry changes, file deletions, and PowerShell commands. The presence of 'del \/A:H' could indicate an attempt to remove evidence. Also, the repeated use of PowerShell with empty scripts might be a way to test or probe the system. However, without more indicators like unusual network activity, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms, it's hard to confirm malicious intent.\n\nBut the fact that there's a file deletion in the temp directory and some PowerShell commands that could be part of a larger attack might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. The justification would be the combination of suspicious file operations and PowerShell usage that could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### **Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **File Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - A file (`modulo_base.exe`) is deleted from the user's temporary directory (`%TEMP%`). While temporary files are often deleted, this could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity (e.g., a payload or tool).\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage with Empty Script Blocks:**\n   - Repeated use of `powershell.exe & {}` (empty script blocks) may be a test or probing behavior. While not inherently malicious, this could be part of a larger attack to check for detection or to execute nested commands later.\n\n3. **Deletion of Hidden File:**\n   - The command `Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore` suggests an attempt to delete a file named `key.log` (possibly containing sensitive data or logs). The use of `-ErrorAction Ignore` indicates the attacker is trying to avoid errors if the file doesn't exist, which is common in cleanup routines tied to malicious payloads.\n\n4. **File Creation in Downloads Folder:**\n   - A file (`tarefa_comum.txt`) is created in the user's downloads directory. While benign on its own, this could be a staging area for further actions if the file contains malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **Neutral\/Normal Activity:**\n- **`whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`:** These are standard utilities for retrieving user information and executing commands. Their presence alone is not suspicious.\n- **PowerShell DLL Loads:** Loading `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal for PowerShell operations.\n- **Winlogbeat File Creation:** The presence of a `.yml` file for Winlogbeat (a log shipper) suggests legitimate monitoring activity, though it could also be a sign of misuse if the configuration is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- The combination of **file deletion**, **PowerShell probing**, and **potential cleanup efforts** (e.g., `del \/A:H`, `Remove-Item`) could indicate an attacker attempting to **remove traces of an exploit or payload**.\n- The lack of clear malicious payloads (e.g., network connections, privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms) means further analysis is needed to determine intent. However, the **behavioral patterns** (cleanup, probing) are consistent with post-exploitation activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs:** Check for network traffic, registry changes, or user account activity that might tie these events to a broader attack.\n- **Analyze File Contents:** Investigate the contents of `tarefa_comum.txt` and any remaining files in the temp directory to rule out malicious payloads.\n- **Monitor for Persistence:** Look for signs of persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry keys) that could indicate the attacker is trying to maintain access.\n\nThis batch is **moderately suspicious** and merits closer examination, particularly if it occurs in a context of other anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access, lateral movement)."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING based on the entire batch.\n\nLooking at the logs, most of them are about PowerShell processes. There are several entries with \"Process Create\" and \"Image loaded\" events. The command lines involve removing a file named key.log in the TEMP directory. Also, there's a lot of activity with .NET DLLs being loaded, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so maybe that's normal, but sometimes malicious scripts use those.\n\nWait, the command line \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore\" is a PowerShell command to delete a file. But why is that suspicious? Well, if an attacker is trying to clean up logs or evidence, they might delete files. However, just deleting a log file might not be enough. But in this case, the same command is repeated multiple times, and there are other events like \"Registry value set\" and \"File created\" followed by \"File Delete logged\". \n\nAlso, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events, which might be part of the logging system's normal operations. But the combination of process creation, image loading, and file deletion could indicate something. However, the user is asking if this batch is interesting. \n\nBut wait, the key point here is that the events don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. The PowerShell commands are standard, and the loaded DLLs are legitimate. The only thing is the deletion of key.log, but without more context, like other suspicious activities or unauthorized access, it's hard to say. Since the batch doesn't have any obvious indicators of compromise, like unusual network activity, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access, maybe it's not interesting. \n\nHowever, maybe the repeated attempts to delete the key.log file are part of an attack. But in the absence of other malicious activities, it's hard to confirm. The justification should be concise. So, perhaps the answer is NOT INTERESTING because the activities are normal system operations and PowerShell commands that don't indicate a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent standard PowerShell operations, .NET framework image loading, and temporary file cleanup. No malicious indicators like unauthorized access, payload execution, or suspicious network activity are present.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But maybe the fact that it's being loaded by PowerShell is something to check? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the user's AppData folder by PowerShell. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use AppData for temporary files. However, alone, that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell. ProcessAccess usually indicates that a process is being accessed by another process or thread. If this is happening multiple times, maybe there's some unauthorized access or manipulation. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that might be normal. But the file name has .new, which could be part of a configuration process. Not too suspicious here.\n\nThen there are several ProcessCreate events for whoami.exe. Whoami is a standard command-line tool that displays user information. It's commonly used in scripts, so this might be part of a legitimate process. However, if it's being called repeatedly or in a suspicious context, that could be an indicator.\n\nThe Registry value set event by PowerShell could be a red flag. Modifying registry values might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. But again, it depends on what exactly was changed.\n\nNow, putting it all together: There's a mix of normal activities (like Windows Defender and whoami) and some events that could be benign or suspicious. However, the multiple ProcessAccess events on PowerShell and the registry modification might indicate something unusual. But I need to check if these events are part of a known legitimate process or if there's a pattern that suggests malicious activity.\n\nWait, the first event's file path is from Windows Defender's MpClient.dll. If that's a legitimate file, then the ImageLoad event is normal. But if the file was modified or if there's an unexpected process loading it, that's a problem. However, the event doesn't mention any anomalies in the file, just that it was loaded.\n\nThe other events involve PowerShell accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a standard tool. The high number of ProcessAccess events might be part of a script that's accessing various processes, which could be normal or could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nBut considering all the events together, there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious activity. The events could be part of normal operations, like system updates or user activities. However, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events and registry changes might warrant further investigation. But according to the criteria, if the batch is not clearly suspicious, it might be classified as not interesting. However, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events and the registry change could be considered interesting for investigation. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to consider the combination of all events. The fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple ProcessAccess events and a registry change, along with creating files in user directories, might be indicative of something. But without more context, like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or other signs of compromise, it's hard to be certain. However, the presence of these events in a batch might be enough to flag it as interesting for further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe, combined with a registry modification and file creation in user directories, suggest potential malicious activity warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
