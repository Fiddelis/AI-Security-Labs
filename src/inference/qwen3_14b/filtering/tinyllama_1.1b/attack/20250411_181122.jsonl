The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is normal, but then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed and having images loaded. The files loaded include some standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework, so that's probably legitimate. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender, which might be a red flag if it's being loaded in an unusual context.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory, which could be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks. The command line for some PowerShell processes includes a script that's searching for files containing 'password' in various document types. That's a common tactic for malware looking to extract sensitive information. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might indicate some kind of persistent or automated process.\n\nAlso, there's a 'findstr.exe' process running with the command line that's searching for 'pass' in files, which is part of the same script. The fact that this is done multiple times and the PowerShell script is being executed several times could suggest an attempt to gather information. The presence of 'notepad.exe' and 'calc.exe' might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nI should check if there's any unusual registry activity, but the events here don't show any obvious changes that would be malicious. However, the combination of the PowerShell script searching for passwords, creating and deleting temporary files, and loading various DLLs might be indicative of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker. Even though some components are legitimate, the overall pattern of behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing a script to search for password-related content in files, combined with temporary file creation\/deletion and loading of potential legitimate but contextually suspicious DLLs (e.g., Windows Defender MpOAV.dll), suggests potential reconnaissance or data-extraction activity.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of logs is interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for any patterns or suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the processes mentioned. There's a lot of chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity. Chrome is common, but the number of registry value sets and network connections might be a red flag. However, I need to check if there's anything unusual.\n\nWait, there's an entry with winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new configuration file might be normal if it's part of setup. However, the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which could be a sign of something being downloaded and executed, but I need more context.\n\nLooking at the schtasks.exe entries. There are two instances where schtasks.exe is deleting scheduled tasks with names like \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\" and \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be normal, but if these tasks were malicious, deleting them might be an attempt to cover tracks. However, the command lines show the deletion is being forced with \/f, which is standard for deleting tasks. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother point: the WMIC.exe process loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate path, but if WMIC is being used for something unexpected, it could be a concern. However, the event just says \"Image loaded,\" which is normal for execution.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe with registry events and process access. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, but without seeing the actual commands or suspicious parameters, it's hard to tell. The presence of ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate other processes, which could be benign or malicious.\n\nThe chrome.exe events include network connections. Multiple network connections from chrome might be normal if the user is browsing, but if they're connecting to suspicious IPs or domains, that would be a problem. However, the logs don't include destination IPs or domains, so I can't confirm that.\n\nThe winlogbeat file creation might be part of a legitimate setup, but if the user didn't initiate it, that could be a sign of something else. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of activity, but nothing overtly malicious. The deletion of scheduled tasks and the winlogbeat file creation are the most notable, but without more context or indicators of compromise (like unusual network traffic, unauthorized access, or suspicious command-line arguments), it's hard to classify this as interesting. The events seem to be part of normal system operations or user activities. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" unless there's a specific pattern I'm missing.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events contain routine system activity (e.g., Chrome and PowerShell operations, registry changes, network connections) without clear indicators of compromise. No suspicious file paths, unusual process behavior, or security-relevant anomalies are present in the logs.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each entry and look for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe being used. That's common, but sometimes they can be used for malicious purposes. Let me check the commands. One of the cmd.exe entries has a command line that deletes files in the Temp directory. The command is \"del %%temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and similar. Deleting temporary files might be normal, but sometimes attackers delete logs or other evidence. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nAnother entry is the use of net.exe with the command \"net user \\\"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\\\" \/del \/domain\". Deleting a user account in a domain could be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger pattern of account manipulation. But again, if it's a legitimate administrative task, it might not be a problem.\n\nThere's also sc.exe being used to delete a service called \"win32times\". Deleting a service might be part of a cleanup after an attack, or it could be a legitimate action if the service is no longer needed. But again, need more context.\n\nThe registry events are mostly about value sets, which are common during system changes. However, if there's a pattern of changing registry keys related to security or system settings, that could be a red flag. But the logs don't specify which keys are being modified, so it's hard to tell.\n\nMultiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. That's a normal command to check the current user, but if it's done excessively, it might indicate someone trying to determine privileges.\n\nThe PowerShell events are frequent, and some have \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes could be a sign of scripting activities, which can be benign or malicious.\n\nLooking at the file delete event, it's deleting a file in the Temp directory. Temp files are often used by malware to store temporary data, so deleting them might be an attempt to remove traces. But again, without knowing the file's origin, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several suspicious activities: deleting user accounts, deleting services, deleting temp files, and multiple process creations. However, these could also be part of legitimate system maintenance. The key is whether these actions are part of a larger pattern that indicates unauthorized access or malicious intent. Since the logs don't provide more context (like user context, source IP, or other related events), it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of multiple potentially suspicious actions might warrant further investigation. So I think the classification is INTERESTING because there are multiple events that could indicate malicious behavior, even if they aren't conclusive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain user accounts (net.exe), deletion of system services (sc.exe), deletion of temporary files in AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp, and repeated execution of whoami.exe and PowerShell commands. These actions could indicate account manipulation, service removal, and potential cleanup of malicious artifacts, warranting further investigation.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances of 'Image loaded' for system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are legitimate .NET components, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. That name looks like a temporary script file, which could be part of a PowerShell script execution. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, which might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. \n\nAnother thing is the 'Pipe Created' event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if there's an unusual number of pipes or they're being used in unexpected ways, that could be a red flag. However, there's only one mention of a pipe here, so maybe that's just part of normal operations.\n\nThere are also events related to whoami.exe being executed. That's a normal command to check the current user, so that's probably benign. The same goes for notepad.exe and calc.exe. The chrome.exe events involve DNS queries and network connections, which are normal for a browser.\n\nThe only potentially suspicious thing is the temporary file created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. That's a common place for malware to drop files, but it's also where legitimate temporary files are stored. However, the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to PowerShell script execution. If there's a script being run that's not supposed to be there, that could be an issue.\n\nBut wait, the batch includes a few instances of 'File created' for the same .winlogbeat.yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its normal operation. However, if that's happening in a directory that's not typical for Winlogbeat, that might be a problem. But the path given is Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\, which seems like a standard installation directory.\n\nPutting it all together, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events seem to be a mix of normal system operations and legitimate processes. The temporary script file could be part of a test or a normal operation. Without more context or additional suspicious events (like unexpected network traffic, unusual registry changes, or unauthorized access), it's hard to classify this as interesting. So, I think the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no strong indication of malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show normal PowerShell operations, temporary file creation, and standard process interactions. No clear indicators of malicious activity (e.g., suspicious network connections, unexpected binaries, or anomalous registry changes) are present across the batch.\"\n}"}
