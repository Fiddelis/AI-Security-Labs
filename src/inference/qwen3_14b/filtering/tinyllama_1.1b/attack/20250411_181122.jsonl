Let's start by looking through the entries.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is normal. Then several 'powershell.exe' processes. The command line for one of them is searching for passwords in files, which might be suspicious. The user is running findstr and select-string commands to look for 'password' in various file types. That could be part of a password search, which is a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, including some .NET DLLs and Windows Defender DLLs. Loading these might be normal, but combined with the command line activity, it's worth noting. Also, a file deletion in the Temp directory is logged, which could be an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nThen there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might relate to PowerShell's execution policy or something else. The repeated command line entries for the same search command might indicate automated scanning. \n\nThere are also multiple 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome's registry changes might be normal, but if they're part of a broader pattern, they could be suspicious. However, the main concern here seems to be the PowerShell activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell processes are searching for passwords in files, which is a common technique in attacks. The deletion of a temporary script file could be an attempt to hide evidence. The multiple image loads and lifecycle events might be part of the attack's execution flow. While some events are normal (like Windows Defender DLLs), the combination of these activities points to potential malicious behavior. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of password searching and file deletion makes this batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to search for passwords in files (e.g., 'findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls'), combined with file deletion in the Temp directory and repeated image loads of .NET and Windows Defender DLLs, suggests potential malicious activity focused on data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and look for any suspicious patterns.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a common tool for logging, so maybe normal. But there are multiple entries of winlogbeat.exe creating the same file path. Maybe that's just part of its normal operation, but repeated creation could be a red flag if it's being overwritten or modified frequently.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe doing several things. It's setting registry values, loading images, and making network connections. Some of these might be normal, but multiple registry changes could indicate something trying to modify system settings. The network connections are common, but if there are a lot, maybe it's communicating with a C2 server.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creating files like objeto_logico.txt and estrutura_ativo.txt. Creating files in the Downloads folder might not be too bad, but if these files are generated by scripts, it could be part of an attack. Also, there are ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe, which might indicate someone trying to access or manipulate the process.\n\nThen there's the whoami.exe and cmd.exe commands. The cmd.exe command is deleting scheduled tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks might be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious. The use of schtasks.exe and the deletion of tasks could be an indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThe WMIC.exe entries are trying to delete notepad.exe processes. Using WMIC to delete processes is a common technique in attacks, especially if trying to remove evidence or prevent certain processes from running. Also, loading dlls like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll might be part of bypassing security features (like AMSI is related to anti-malware).\n\nLooking at the overall picture: multiple process creations, file creations, registry changes, and attempts to delete processes and scheduled tasks. The use of tools like WMIC and schtasks, along with the deletion of tasks and processes, points towards someone trying to manipulate the system, possibly for persistence or to avoid detection. The repeated actions by powershell.exe and the use of command-line tools to delete tasks are concerning.\n\nI should also check for any command-line arguments that might indicate malicious intent. The cmd.exe command has a complex command line that deletes scheduled tasks, which could be part of an attack lifecycle. The WMIC command to delete notepad.exe processes might be an attempt to remove a payload or prevent analysis.\n\nIn summary, the combination of process and task deletions, multiple registry modifications, and the use of tools typically associated with malicious activities (like WMIC and schtasks) suggest that this log might be related to an attack. The repeated actions by powershell.exe and the deletion of scheduled tasks are strong indicators of suspicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit several **suspicious patterns** indicative of **malicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Below is a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Process and Task Deletion**\n- **`cmd.exe`** executing a command to delete scheduled tasks:\n  ```bash\n  schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" \/f >nul 2>&1 & schtasks \/delete \/tn \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\" \/f >nul 2>&1\n  ```\n  - **Indicator**: Deleting scheduled tasks named with seemingly arbitrary strings (`unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `unidade_comum_005_OnStartup`) could be an attempt to **remove persistence mechanisms** or evade detection.\n  - **Risk**: This behavior is commonly seen in post-exploitation phases to clean up artifacts.\n\n- **`WMIC.exe`** deleting `notepad.exe` processes:\n  ```bash\n  wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\n  ```\n  - **Indicator**: Using `WMIC` to terminate processes is a known technique for **removing evidence** or preventing analysis (e.g., terminating decoy or monitoring processes).\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell and Registry Manipulation**\n- **Multiple `ProcessAccess` events** for `powershell.exe`:\n  - **Indicator**: Frequent access to processes by PowerShell may suggest **script-based attacks** (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation).\n  - **Risk**: PowerShell is a common tool for malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities.\n\n- **Registry modifications** by `chrome.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`:\n  - **Indicator**: Unusual registry changes could indicate **tampering with system settings** (e.g., modifying startup entries, disabling security features, or injecting malicious code).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use of Command-Line Tools for Malicious Purposes**\n- **`schtasks.exe`** loading `taskschd.dll`:\n  - **Indicator**: While `schtasks.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use in conjunction with suspicious task deletions (above) raises concerns.\n  - **Risk**: Could be part of **scheduled task manipulation** for persistence or execution.\n\n- **`WMIC.exe`** loading `urlmon.dll` and `amsi.dll`:\n  - **Indicator**: `amsi.dll` is part of **Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI)**. Loading this DLL may indicate an attempt to **bypass AMSI** (e.g., by hooking or disabling it).\n  - **Risk**: Suggests **anti-forensic or evasion techniques**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. File Creation in Suspicious Contexts**\n- **`powershell.exe`** creating files like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt` in the Downloads directory:\n  - **Indicator**: While file creation alone is not suspicious, the **context** (e.g., generated by PowerShell, possibly via scripts) may indicate **data exfiltration** or **malicious payload storage**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Repeated Activity by Winlogbeat**\n- Multiple entries of **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating the same file (`objeto_logico.txt`, `estrutura_ativo.txt`):\n  - **Indicator**: While Winlogbeat is a legitimate log shipper, repeated file creation may indicate **log tampering** or **misconfiguration**.\n  - **Risk**: Could be a red herring or an attempt to **obfuscate malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **multiple high-risk indicators** consistent with **malicious activity**, including:\n- **Task and process deletion** (likely for cleanup\/persistence).\n- **Registry manipulation** (possible tampering).\n- **Use of PowerShell and WMIC** for evasion or execution.\n- **Suspicious file creation** in potentially malicious contexts.\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n1. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, file hashes) to confirm malicious intent.\n2. **Investigate the origin of the PowerShell scripts** and files created.\n3. **Check for AMSI bypass** via `amsi.dll` loading.\n4. **Audit scheduled tasks** for unauthorized entries.\n5. **Isolate affected systems** and conduct a full forensic analysis.\n\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate attention."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first event is about WMIC.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, but maybe the presence of other events could change that. Then there's a bunch of cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes. The command lines show things like deleting users with net user \/del, which is suspicious. Deleting user accounts might be part of an attack, like removing a user to cover tracks or set up a new one.\n\nThen there's the sc.exe deleting a service called win32times. Deleting services can be malicious if it's removing something that's monitoring or protecting the system. Also, multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values. The registry events could indicate changes to system settings or hiding malicious activities.\n\nThe whoami.exe commands are common, but combined with other actions, they might be used to check the current user context. The 'Provider Lifecycle' events with powershell.exe might be part of some script or automation, but if they're empty or just braces, that could be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple process creations and registry modifications without clear justification could indicate an attacker trying to maintain persistence or alter system behavior.\n\nHowever, some of these events alone might not be alarming. But when combined, especially the user deletions, service removal, and registry changes, it suggests someone is trying to modify the system's configuration, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of these actions is typical in post-exploitation phases.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92,\n  \"REASONING\": \"Multiple suspicious patterns detected: 1) Deletion of user accounts via 'net user \/del' (potential lateral movement or account cleanup). 2) Service deletion ('sc delete win32times') which could remove monitoring tools. 3) Repeated PowerShell process access and registry modifications (possible persistence mechanisms). 4) WMIC loading from Windows Defender path (could indicate tampering). 5) Unusual 'Provider Lifecycle' events with empty PowerShell commands (potential obfuscation). The combination of user account manipulation, service removal, and registry changes suggests system compromise and attempted persistence.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So the user wants me to analyze the batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' loading image files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are all .NET related DLLs, which are part of the standard .NET framework. That seems normal because PowerShell often uses these when running scripts or interacting with .NET objects. But then there's an entry where PowerShell is accessing the registry and processes. However, those are common activities for PowerShell, so not necessarily suspicious.\n\nWait, but then there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its setup. But the same file is mentioned twice, so maybe that's just part of the installation or configuration process. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a standard command to get user information, so that's normal. However, the same process is listed multiple times, but that could just be repeated commands. Also, 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' modifying registry values. RuntimeBroker is part of the Windows system, handling app permissions, so registry changes might be normal. Notepad modifying the registry? That's less common, but if it's part of a user's actions, maybe not suspicious.\n\nLooking further, 'Calculator.exe' loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate DLL for handling URLs, so that's normal. Then 'chrome.exe' doing DNS queries and network connections. That's expected behavior for a browser. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether there's any unusual activity. The majority of the events seem to be normal operations. PowerShell using .NET DLLs is standard. The file creation by winlogbeat is part of its setup. The registry changes by various processes don't indicate malicious behavior unless there's a pattern. However, there's no evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unexpected file paths, unusual network connections, or suspicious command lines beyond standard operations. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the justification should be concise. So even though there are multiple PowerShell events, they're all related to legitimate operations. No signs of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The presence of winlogbeat might be part of a monitoring setup, which is normal. \n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't show any indicators of compromise. The events are either normal system processes or part of legitimate software operations. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, since while there's no obvious malicious activity, the repetition of some events might be worth a slight note, but overall, nothing suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show normal system operations (e.g., PowerShell loading .NET DLLs, Chrome DNS queries, Winlogbeat file creation) and standard process interactions. No suspicious patterns, lateral movement, or malicious activity indicators are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
