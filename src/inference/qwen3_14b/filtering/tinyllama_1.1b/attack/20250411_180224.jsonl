{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first event stands out because it's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes powershell.exe -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\", which might be a red flag since the name includes \"NonExistingScript\" but is still being referenced. The task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a bit suspicious because typically scheduled tasks for system-level operations are more controlled.\n\nNext, there's a process access event for powershell.exe, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious. Then there are registry value set events for cmd.exe and conhost.exe, which might be normal, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it could indicate some configuration changes. The schtasks.exe events are about querying the task, which is normal, but the initial creation is the odd one out.\n\nThe chrome.exe events are all registry changes, which might be benign, but repeated events could be part of some monitoring or extension activity. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file, which is likely part of a log collection process and not malicious. The whoami.exe command is standard for checking user context, so that's probably legitimate.\n\nPutting this all together, the main suspicious activity is the initial scheduled task creation with the PowerShell script. The presence of \"-ep bypass\" suggests that the script is trying to bypass execution policy, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. Even though the script file doesn't exist, the attempt to create a scheduled task with such parameters is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The other events don't seem to tie into this, so the classification is interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious scheduled task creation via cmd.exe with a PowerShell command using '-ep bypass' (bypassing execution policy) and a non-existent script path, indicating potential malicious activity. Other events (e.g., chrome.exe registry changes, winlogbeat file creation) appear benign.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
