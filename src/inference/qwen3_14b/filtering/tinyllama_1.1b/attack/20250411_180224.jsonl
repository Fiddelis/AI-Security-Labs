The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several process creations involving schtasks.exe and cmd.exe. One of the cmd.exe commands is creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes running powershell.exe with -ep bypass and executing a script. The script paths mentioned are c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filenames have \"NonExistingScript\" in them. That might be a red flag because the names suggest the scripts don't exist, which could be an attempt to obfuscate or mislead. But maybe the user is using those names intentionally, but in a real attack, that's a common tactic.\n\nAlso, there's a scheduled task named \"win32times\" created with the user \"system\" and set to run daily. That's suspicious because running a task as the system account with elevated privileges could be part of a persistence mechanism. The use of -ep bypass in PowerShell is known to bypass execution policies, which is often used in attacks to run scripts that would otherwise be blocked.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple registry value set events for svchost.exe and chrome.exe. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but multiple registry changes could indicate something like a registry-based persistence method. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The chrome.exe events are just registry changes, which might be normal if the user is interacting with Chrome, but combined with other events, it's part of a larger picture.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events. One is for estrutura_geral.txt and another for a .winlogbeat.yml.new file. The latter might be related to configuration changes for winlogbeat, but if that's unexpected, it could be relevant. However, the first file is just a text file, which might be benign unless there's more context.\n\nThe Image loaded events for taskschd.dll are normal because that's part of the Task Scheduler service. So those are probably legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges, using PowerShell with bypassed execution policy to run a non-existent script, and multiple registry changes. Even though some of the events could be normal, the combination of creating a scheduled task with system-level privileges and using PowerShell in a way that bypasses security policies is suspicious. The non-existent script names might be a red herring, but the overall pattern of creating persistence mechanisms is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity: creation of a scheduled task (win32times) with elevated privileges (run as 'system'), use of PowerShell with -ep bypass (bypassing execution policies), and execution of non-existent scripts (c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1). These patterns are commonly associated with persistence mechanisms and potential exploitation.\"\n}"}
