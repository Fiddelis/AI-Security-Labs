{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is normal. Then, several 'powershell.exe' processes are being accessed and creating registry entries. But then, one of the powershell.exe instances has a command line that stands out. The command line includes a series of commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users', 'get-childitem C:\\Users', 'dir C:\\Users', 'get-localgroup', and 'net localgroup'. \n\nThat's a lot of commands. These seem to be gathering information about users, groups, and checking stored credentials. The 'cmdkey.exe \/list' command lists stored credentials, which could be a red flag if done without authorization. Also, listing user directories and group memberships might indicate the attacker is trying to map out the system's user structure.\n\nThen, there's a file created in the Temp directory named something like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1' and then immediately deleted. That's a common tactic to execute a script temporarily without leaving traces. The fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might be related to the logging or monitoring tools, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated 'Process Create' events for 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' (though 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows tool) could be suspicious. The 'net1.exe' might be a typo or a renamed malicious executable.\n\nThe loading of various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll (from Windows Defender) might be normal for PowerShell operations, but the presence of MpOAV.dll could be related to antivirus activity. However, combined with the other commands, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably part of a legitimate log collection process, but the name of the file (with .yml.new) might be part of a configuration setup. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together, the most suspicious parts are the PowerShell commands gathering system information, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the unusual process names like 'net1.exe'. These could indicate reconnaissance activities as part of a broader attack. The presence of multiple 'Process Create' events for 'net.exe' and the typo in 'net1.exe' might suggest either a misconfiguration or an attempt to mask the true malicious process.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these events could be part of normal operations, especially if the system is running scripts or using tools that interact with the registry and file system. But given the combination of information-gathering commands and the temporary file, it leans more towards being a security incident worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Reconnaissance Activity**\n- **Command Line Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n  powershell.exe & {net user; get-localuser; get-localgroupmember; cmdkey.exe \/list; ls C:\/Users; get-childitem C:\\Users; dir C:\\Users; get-localgroup; net localgroup}\n  ```\n  - **Indicators**:\n    - **Information Gathering**: Commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, and `dir C:\\Users` suggest **reconnaissance** to map users, groups, and file systems.\n    - **Credential Enumeration**: `cmdkey.exe \/list` lists stored credentials, which could be used to identify **stored passwords or credentials** (e.g., from `cmdkey \/add`).\n    - **Script Execution**: The use of a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1`) created and immediately deleted in the `Temp` directory is a **common tactic** to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual Processes and File Activity**\n- **File Creation and Deletion**:\n  - A temporary PowerShell script file is created in the `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) and later deleted. This could indicate **post-exploitation activity** or **script execution**.\n- **Suspicious Process Name**:\n  - `net1.exe` (command: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1 user`) is not a standard Windows utility. This could be a **malicious binary** or a **renamed tool** (e.g., a typo or obfuscation of `net.exe`).\n\n---\n\n### **3. DLL Loading and Potential Tooling**\n- **Loaded DLLs**:\n  - `urlmon.dll`, `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clrjit.dll` are associated with **PowerShell** and **.NET runtime**, which is normal for script execution.\n  - `MpOAV.dll` (from Windows Defender) is loaded, which might be **legitimate**, but its presence alongside suspicious commands could indicate **antivirus evasion** or **tooling**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Security Group Management Event**\n- The log includes an entry for **\"Security Group Management\"** with no associated process or file. This could indicate **group policy changes**, **SID manipulation**, or **privilege escalation** attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Winlogbeat Activity**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory is likely **legitimate** (e.g., configuring a log shipper). However, the file name and path could be **part of an attack chain** (e.g., a staged configuration file for further exploitation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Likely Malicious Activity**\n- **High Risk**: The combination of **PowerShell reconnaissance**, **temporary script execution**, **unusual processes** (`net1.exe`), and **file creation\/deletion** strongly suggests **post-exploitation activity** or **initial access**.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  1. **Investigate the `net1.exe` process** (check its hash, origin, and behavior).\n  2. **Analyze the PowerShell script** (if recoverable) for malicious payloads.\n  3. **Check for lateral movement** (e.g., `net user` commands across systems).\n  4. **Monitor Windows Defender logs** for signs of evasion or tampering.\n  5. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) to confirm the scope of the activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict**\n**This log batch contains clear indicators of suspicious behavior consistent with a **malicious actor performing reconnaissance and potentially preparing for further exploitation**. Immediate investigation is recommended.**"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are several winlog entries with tasks like 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management'. These are typically administrative tasks, but they're not necessarily malicious. However, when they repeat multiple times, like seven instances of 'Security Group Management', that might be a red flag. Maybe someone is making a lot of changes to security groups, which could be an attempt to escalate privileges or hide other activities.\n\nThen, there's an entry with 'cmdkey.exe' listing credentials. That's a legitimate tool, but using it to list stored credentials could be part of a credential dumping attack. The next entries involve 'powershell.exe' and 'conhost.exe' with registry value changes. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing commands, so multiple registry changes might indicate configuration changes to persist or hide the attack.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but if it's creating a new configuration file, that's normal. However, the name '.yml.new' suggests it might be a temporary file, but not necessarily malicious. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, maybe not.\n\nThen there's 'notepad.exe' and 'svchost.exe' making registry changes. Notepad is usually benign, but if it's being used to modify registry keys, that's suspicious. 'svchost.exe' is a host process for Windows services, so it's normal, but again, multiple registry changes could be part of an attack.\n\nThe last entry is 'Calculator.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. That's a standard system DLL, so that's normal. But if an attacker is injecting code into a legitimate process, that could be a concern. However, just loading a standard DLL isn't necessarily bad.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple security group management events, credential listing, registry changes by PowerShell and other processes, and a new file created. While some of these are normal, the combination of repeated administrative tasks, credential access, and registry modifications might indicate an insider threat or a compromised account trying to make changes. However, without more context like IP addresses, user accounts, or unusual command-line arguments, it's a bit hard to be certain. The confidence isn't super high, but enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated security group\/user account management events, credential listing via cmdkey.exe, and suspicious registry modifications by PowerShell\/conhost.exe suggest potential administrative compromise or privilege escalation attempts. The combination of these activities warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
