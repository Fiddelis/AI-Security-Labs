{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's powershell.exe involved. Let me check those entries.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe events, there's a lot of image loads. The files loaded are some .dlls from the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script. Then, almost immediately after, that same file is deleted. Hmm, creating and deleting a script might be a red flag. Why create it and then delete it? Maybe to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is executing commands to download files from GitHub. The command lines use WebClient's DownloadFile method to get LICENSE.txt files and save them to the Temp directory. But the URLs are from GitHub repositories. Now, GitHub is a common place for legitimate code, but downloading files from there could be part of a malicious activity if the files are not intended. However, the fact that they're downloading LICENSE.txt might be a red herring. Those files are usually just text files, but maybe they're using that as a cover for something else. Also, the filenames are generic, which might be a way to avoid detection.\n\nWait, but looking at the command lines, they're using the same structure each time. The user could be testing or just downloading files, but the repetition might indicate automation. Also, the fact that after downloading, the files are created and then deleted. Wait, no, in the logs, the file is created and then deleted. But the DownloadFile commands don't show deletion in the same event. Maybe the deletion is a separate event. So the process creates a file, then deletes it. That could be an attempt to hide the presence of the script.\n\nAnother point is that there's an image loaded from the Windows Defender directory, MpClient.dll. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably okay. But then there's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Maybe that's related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used to execute scripts automatically. If that's being modified, it could be a sign of persistence.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events of ProcessAccess and ImageLoad for powershell.exe. That's normal, but combined with the file creation and deletion, it's worth noting. The Registry value set events might be related to changing settings, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious activities are the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts and the multiple downloads from GitHub. While downloading from GitHub isn't inherently malicious, the pattern of creating and deleting files, along with the repetition of similar commands, could indicate something malicious. However, without more context like the content of the downloaded files or unusual behavior post-download, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the actions taken (create, delete, repeated downloads), it's on the edge of suspicious. So, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, though not definitively malicious. Key indicators include:\n\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation and Deletion**:  \n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`*.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted. This behavior is often used to execute malicious code while minimizing forensic traces.\n\n2. **Repetitive GitHub File Downloads**:  \n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes execute commands to download `LICENSE.txt` files from GitHub repositories (e.g., `https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...`). While GitHub is a legitimate source, the repetitive nature of these downloads and the use of generic filenames (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`) could indicate obfuscation or automated data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Unusual File Paths and Registry Activity**:  \n   - A file is created in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, which could relate to PowerShell profile persistence mechanisms. Combined with `Registry value set` events, this may suggest configuration changes or attempts to establish persistence.\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Components**:  \n   - While some activities (e.g., loading `.NET` DLLs, Windows Defender components) are normal, the combination with the above behaviors raises concerns about potential misuse of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe events exhibit patterns consistent with **malicious activity**, such as stealthy script execution and potential data exfiltration. Further analysis (e.g., inspecting downloaded files, correlating with network traffic, and checking for lateral movement) is necessary to confirm intent. This batch is **interesting for investigation** due to the suspicious behavioral patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I should check other events.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe and svchost.exe modifying the registry. Notepad is usually benign, but svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. Multiple registry changes from svchost could be suspicious, especially if they're related to persistence.\n\nThe Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal since that's a standard DLL. But then there's a lot of powershell.exe activity. Multiple ProcessAccess events and RegistryEvent changes from powershell could indicate someone trying to modify settings or execute scripts.\n\nThe cmd.exe command trying to delete a scheduled task named \"spawn\" might be an attempt to remove something malicious. Then, schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal, but the deletion command could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's a reg.exe command deleting a registry key under Run, which is often used for persistence. If an attacker is removing their own entry, that's a red flag. The conhost.exe also modifying the registry is unusual since that's typically a console host process.\n\nThe repeated powershell.exe events with \"Provider Lifecycle\" might be noise, but the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory could be part of script execution. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be an attempt to hide activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes, PowerShell activity, deletion of a scheduled task, and registry key deletion under Run. These could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence and then cleaning up traces. However, some events might be legitimate, like setting up winlogbeat or running scripts. The confidence isn't 100% but enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, registry modifications (including deletion of a Run key), scheduled task deletion, and file creation\/deletion in temporary directories.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these logs. There's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. Multiple entries show PowerShell processes creating files, accessing processes, and loading images. For example, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which might be normal, but the repeated ProcessAccess events could indicate something suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a file created in the Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. That could be a script being executed, which might be benign, but combined with other events, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the loading of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being accessed repeatedly by PowerShell, maybe there's an issue. However, there's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is part of log shipping, so that's probably normal.\n\nThe presence of multiple \"Registry value set\" events for PowerShell and other processes might indicate configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe fact that there are several events with the same command_line 'powershell.exe & {}' could be part of normal operations, but the repetition might be a red flag. Also, the Pipe Created events for both PowerShell and Chrome might be normal, but again, the frequency is something to check.\n\nOverall, while some activities are normal, the high frequency of PowerShell-related events, file creations, and registry changes could indicate potential malicious activity. It's not conclusive, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate a high volume of activity primarily involving **PowerShell.exe**, with several events that could be **suspicious or indicative of potential malicious behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **File Creation**: PowerShell is creating files in sensitive locations, such as:\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` (possibly related to PowerShell profile scripts).\n     - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1` (a temporary script file, which could be benign but warrants scrutiny if unexpected).\n   - **Process Access**: Repeated \"ProcessAccess\" events (e.g., `powershell.exe` accessing other processes) may indicate attempts to manipulate or inject code into other processes.\n   - **Image Loading**: PowerShell is loading system DLLs like `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll` (part of the .NET runtime). While legitimate, this could also be part of **PowerShell-based payloads** (e.g., using `Start-Process` or `Invoke-Expression`).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple \"Registry value set\" events for `powershell.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`, and `chrome.exe` suggest **potential configuration changes**. If these modifications involve disabling security features (e.g., script execution policies), they could be **malicious**.\n\n3. **Repeated Command-Line Patterns**:\n   - The recurring command line `powershell.exe & {}` (empty script block) is unusual and may indicate **script obfuscation** or **placeholder activity** (e.g., part of a larger attack chain).\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**:\n   - **Legitimate**: \n     - `winlogbeat.exe` creating files (part of log shipping\/monitoring).\n     - Loading of `MpClient.dll` (Windows Defender component).\n   - **Suspicious**:\n     - Frequent \"Pipe Created\" events for `powershell.exe` and `chrome.exe` (could indicate inter-process communication for malicious purposes).\n     - Lack of clear purpose for temporary script files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1`).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: File creation in `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` could be an attempt to **persist access** via PowerShell profiles.\n- **Code Injection**: Repeated \"ProcessAccess\" events may suggest **code injection** into other processes (e.g., `chrome.exe` or system services).\n- **Script Execution**: The presence of temporary scripts and empty command-line arguments may indicate **obfuscated malicious scripts** being executed.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Analyze the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1` and `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` for malicious payloads.\n   - Check PowerShell execution policies (e.g., `Get-ExecutionPolicy`) to ensure they are not set to `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted`.\n\n2. **Monitor Registry Changes**:\n   - Audit registry modifications to confirm they are not disabling security features (e.g., `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\EnableLUA`).\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if `chrome.exe` or other processes are being used as **entry points for lateral movement** (e.g., through `Pipe Created` events).\n\n4. **Log Analysis**:\n   - Correlate events with other logs (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to determine if this is part of a **larger attack** (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n\n5. **Yara Rules**:\n   - Use Yara rules to detect obfuscated PowerShell scripts or known malicious payloads in the temporary files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, `MpClient.dll`) is legitimate, the **high frequency of PowerShell-related events**, **unusual file creation**, and **registry modifications** suggest **potential malicious behavior**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or part of an **attack**."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a lot of \"Remove-Item\" commands targeting files in the TEMP directory. The command lines are similar, trying to delete different files each time, like \"objeto_principal.zip\", \"tarefa_base.zip\", etc. The fact that they're using the TEMP directory and trying to remove files might be normal, but the repetition and the number of times this happens could be suspicious.\n\nThen, looking at the other events, there are several \"Image loaded\" entries pointing to .NET framework DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, there's also an entry for \"MpOAV.dll\" and \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender. That might be related to security software, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file name is a PowerShell script, which might be part of a script execution. But the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly could be an attempt to hide activity. Also, the \"Pipe Created\" event might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger process.\n\nThe \"Registry value set\" events are common in normal operations, but if there's a lot of them, it might indicate changes to the registry. However, in this case, there aren't too many, so maybe not a red flag.\n\nThe \"Process accessed\" event might be normal, but again, depends on context. The repetition of the same command lines with different file names in the TEMP directory is a pattern that could indicate automated or scripted behavior. Since the user is looking for malicious behavior, this pattern might be worth investigating.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity. There's no mention of network activity, elevation of privileges, or execution of malicious payloads. All the processes are related to PowerShell and system files. The deletion of files in the TEMP directory could be part of a legitimate cleanup process, but the fact that it's done multiple times with different file names might be unusual.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch has multiple PowerShell processes attempting to delete various files in the TEMP directory, which could be a sign of something trying to clean up traces. However, without more context, it's hard to confirm if it's malicious. But the repetition and the pattern might be enough to flag it for further investigation. So, I think the answer is that it's interesting and requires further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **normal system behavior with no clear evidence of malicious activity**, but there are **repetitive patterns** that warrant cautious monitoring. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **PowerShell Deletion of Temporary Files**:\n   - Multiple entries show `Remove-Item` commands targeting files in the `%TEMP%` directory (e.g., `objeto_principal.zip`, `tarefa_base.txt`). This is **common in legitimate processes** (e.g., cleanup after temporary script execution, failed operations, or user activity).\n   - **No malicious payloads** are explicitly referenced in the command lines (e.g., no `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, or suspicious file paths).\n\n2. **Legitimate System DLLs Loaded**:\n   - PowerShell loads `.NET` framework components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) and **Windows Defender modules** (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`), which are **expected in normal operations**.\n\n3. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - A file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and not deleted, but this could be part of **PowerShell profile initialization** or user-specific configurations.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access Events**:\n   - Registry writes and process access events are **not inherently suspicious** but could indicate **custom configurations** or scripting.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (But Not Confirmatory)**\n- **Repetitive Deletion Patterns**: The repeated use of `Remove-Item` with different filenames in `%TEMP%` might suggest **scripted cleanup** or **attempted obfuscation**. However, this is **not definitive** without context (e.g., timing, source of files).\n- **Lack of Network or Privilege Escalation Activity**: No evidence of lateral movement, remote connections, or privilege elevation is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Classification**: **Benign but unusual** (normal system behavior with repetitive patterns).\n- **Recommendation**: \n  - **No immediate action required** unless this activity is observed in conjunction with other suspicious behaviors (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized process execution).\n  - **Monitor for persistence mechanisms** (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry keys) that might be triggering these deletions.\n  - **Context is critical**: If these logs are from a **user with limited privileges** or in a **restricted environment**, further investigation may be warranted.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not malicious**, but the repetitive pattern of temporary file deletion could be a **false positive** or **early indicator of a larger process** (e.g., a script or tool). Further analysis is advised if this behavior persists or escalates."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images, like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others from the .NET Framework. That seems normal because PowerShell often uses those DLLs. But then there's also a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. That's a PowerShell script file. Creating a script in Temp might be suspicious, especially if it's not part of regular operations.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several Remove-Item commands trying to delete files in the Temp directory. The names of the files are things like registro_comum.txt, estrutura_padrao.txt, and pacote_ativo.txt. Deleting these might be part of cleanup, but if they're being deleted after being created, maybe there's something else going on. However, the justification for suspicion here is not immediately clear. Also, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a normal command to check the current user, so that's probably benign.\n\nNow, there are multiple entries of Process accessed and Registry value set events for PowerShell. But there's also a Chrome.exe process with Registry value set events. However, Chrome's entries are repetitive and don't show any obvious malicious activity. The key point here is that the majority of the events are related to PowerShell, which is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nThe presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs is normal, but the combination with the FileCreate event for a .ps1 script might indicate that a script was executed. However, without more context, like the content of the script or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure. The fact that the script is in the Temp directory could be a red flag, as attackers often use Temp folders to store malicious scripts.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The events do show PowerShell performing several actions, but none of them are overtly malicious. The deletion of temporary files could be part of a normal process. However, the repetition of Process accessed and Registry events might indicate that PowerShell is being used extensively, which could be a sign of something like a script-based attack or configuration changes. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nI need to balance between the normal activities of PowerShell and the potential for malicious behavior. Since the logs don't show obvious indicators like network connections, unauthorized access, or suspicious command-line arguments beyond the Remove-Item commands, maybe it's not a high priority. But the presence of a created .ps1 file in Temp might still be worth investigating further. So, I think this is somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. Therefore, the classification should be \"interesting\" for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Creation in Temp Directory**  \n   - A `.ps1` script file (`registro_comum.txt`, `estrutura_padrao.txt`, etc.) was created in the Temp directory. While temporary files are common, scripts in Temp can sometimes be used for malicious purposes (e.g., staged payloads or cleanup after execution).\n\n2. **Repetitive Process Access and Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple `Process accessed` and `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe` suggest PowerShell is being used intensively. This could indicate automation, configuration changes, or exploitation (e.g., PowerShell Empire or other frameworks).\n\n3. **Deletion of Temporary Files**  \n   - The `Remove-Item` commands deleting files like `registro_comum.txt` might be part of a cleanup process, but the lack of context (e.g., why these files were created) raises questions.\n\n### **Less Concerning Activity:**\n- **.NET DLL Loads**: Loading `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, etc., is normal for PowerShell operations.\n- **Chrome.exe Activity**: Repetitive registry modifications for Chrome are likely benign (e.g., extension updates or user settings).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile no direct evidence of malicious activity (e.g., network calls, privilege escalation, or suspicious payloads) is present, the **combination of PowerShell script creation in Temp, repetitive process\/registry interactions, and file deletions** suggests **potential for further investigation**. This could indicate legitimate automation or early-stage adversarial activity (e.g., reconnaissance or setup).  \n\n**Classification:** **Interesting (Low to Medium Priority)** – Requires deeper analysis (e.g., inspecting the `.ps1` script content, correlating with other logs, or checking for lateral movement)."}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The user provided two log entries. The first one is about powershell.exe being accessed with the ProcessAccess rule. The second is about whoami.exe being created via ProcessCreate. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to check if these are normal activities. PowerShell is a common tool, but sometimes used in attacks. However, just accessing it might not be suspicious. The second event is whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info. But why would someone run that? Maybe part of a script or just checking privileges.\n\nWait, but the first event's file is None, which might mean no file was accessed, just the process. The second has a command line, which is normal. Are there any signs of malicious behavior? Like unexpected parameters or unusual paths? The whoami path is the standard one. \n\nBut maybe the combination is interesting. If someone is using PowerShell and then running whoami, perhaps trying to check their privileges. But that's a normal scenario. Unless there's more events, but here only two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ProcessAccess rule for PowerShell could be a red flag if it's accessing sensitive files, but the file field is None.
