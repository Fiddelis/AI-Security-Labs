{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe with NetworkConnect events. That's normal, as Chrome often connects to the internet. Not too concerning yet.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, but it's not inherently malicious. However, the presence of whoami might be part of a larger sequence of commands.\n\nLooking further, there are several powershell.exe processes. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The command lines here include things like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse, which are just directory listing commands. But the fact that there are multiple instances of PowerShell being used could be a red flag, especially if they're part of a script that's doing more than just listing files.\n\nWait, there's a file deletion event for a temporary script file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_2ou0ewlg.ry1.ps1. Deleting a script might be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious. Also, the image loads include some .dll files from Windows Defender, which is normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that PowerShell is loading various components, possibly for executing scripts.\n\nAnother thing is the creation of files like objeto_principal.txt. Not sure what that's for, but if it's part of data exfiltration or storing malicious content, that could be bad. Also, the FileCreate events for PowerShell might be part of writing out malicious code or logs.\n\nThe Pipe Created event could be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so that might be part of normal operations.\n\nPutting this together: multiple PowerShell commands, file creation and deletion, image loads, and some registry changes. While some of these are normal, the combination could indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The deletion of a script file is a bit concerning. However, without more context like unusual network connections, unauthorized access, or known malicious payloads, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple PowerShell activities could be benign, but in a security context, it's worth investigating further. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a moderate confidence level, but not certain. The key points are the repeated PowerShell usage, file operations, and possible script cleanup.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use:** Multiple `powershell.exe` processes are logged, with commands like `ls -recurse` and `get-childitem -recurse` (directory listing operations). While these are benign on their own, the **volume and context** of PowerShell usage could indicate **reconnaissance** or **script-based attacks**.\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** \n     - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) is deleted. This may be an attempt to **clean up evidence** of malicious activity (e.g., post-exploitation).\n     - A file named `objeto_principal.txt` is created. The name is non-descriptive and could be used for **data exfiltration** or **storing malicious payloads**.\n\n2. **Image Loads:**\n   - **Windows Defender DLLs:** Loading `MpClient.dll` and `MpClient.dll` (from Windows Defender) is normal, but the **frequent image load events** might indicate PowerShell is interacting with security tools, possibly to **bypass detection** or **analyze defenses**.\n\n3. **File and Registry Activity:**\n   - **File Creation:** A `.yml.new` file (associated with Winlogbeat, a log collector) is created. This could be part of **legitimate log collection** or **malicious configuration**.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Multiple `Registry value set` events (e.g., by `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`) may indicate **configuration changes** or **Persistence mechanisms**.\n\n4. **Network Activity:**\n   - **Chrome NetworkConnect:** While normal, the lack of detailed network destination information (e.g., IPs, domains) limits analysis. If these connections are to **unusual or malicious endpoints**, they would be a red flag.\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns:**\n- **Script Cleanup:** The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1`) suggests **attempts to erase traces** of malicious activity.\n- **Unusual File Names:** Files like `objeto_principal.txt` (Spanish for \"main object\") lack context and could be **data storage** or **exfiltration channels**.\n- **PowerShell as a Vector:** The combination of PowerShell usage, file operations, and registry changes could indicate **script-based attacks** (e.g., credential harvesting, lateral movement).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activities (e.g., Chrome, Winlogbeat) are legitimate, the **repeated PowerShell operations**, **file creation\/deletion**, and **registry modifications** raise **moderate suspicion** of **reconnaissance or exploitation**. This warrants further investigation, such as:\n- Analyzing the deleted script's content (if recoverable).\n- Correlating network traffic with these events.\n- Checking for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\n**Verdict:** **INTERESTING** (likely benign but requires deeper analysis to rule out malicious intent)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file at the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating a configuration file makes sense. But maybe the user is trying to set up or modify the configuration, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe and svchost.exe with registry value set events. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys that control system behavior. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, and it's common for it to interact with the registry. But multiple registry changes in a short time might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious or just normal operations.\n\nNext, there's another event where winlogbeat.exe creates the same file again. Maybe it's a repeated action, but again, could be part of normal operations. Then, there's an image loaded event for calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is the calculator application, and urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL used for URL moniker handling. But why is Calculator.exe loading it? That's normal because urlmon.dll is part of the Windows system. However, if an unexpected process is loading a DLL, that could be a problem. But in this case, the process is Calculator.exe, which is expected to use urlmon.dll for certain functions. So maybe that's normal.\n\nLooking at all the events together, the main points are: multiple registry changes by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, and file creation by winlogbeat.exe. But the file creation by winlogbeat seems legitimate. The registry changes could be part of normal system operations, especially if svchost.exe is involved. However, if there's a pattern of excessive registry modifications or if they're in sensitive keys, that might be concerning. But with the given data, there's no indication of that.\n\nAlso, the presence of both Calculator.exe and calc.exe might be a typo or different instances, but both are legitimate processes. The repetition of events might just be multiple log entries from different times or different instances. Without more context on the timing or the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nSo, considering all that, the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The processes involved are legitimate, and the actions taken (like creating a config file, registry changes, loading DLLs) are normal. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. But I should check if there's any unusual combination. For example, if winlogbeat was creating a file and then registry changes, but there's no direct link here. The confidence is probably around 0.3 because there's no clear malicious pattern, but the justification is that the activities are normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal system operations: file creation by winlogbeat.exe (a log shipper), registry modifications by svchost.exe (common for system services), and legitimate DLL loading by calculator processes. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
