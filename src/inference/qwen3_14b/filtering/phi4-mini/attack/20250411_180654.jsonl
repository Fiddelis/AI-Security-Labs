The first event is about a file creation by powershell.exe, which is normal, but then there are multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. That's a bit odd because chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much. Then there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate tool but might be used for reconnaissance.\n\nThe key part here is the powershell.exe processes running scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script's name suggests it's capturing keystrokes, which is a clear sign of malicious activity. The log paths are in temporary directories, which is common for malware to hide. Also, there are multiple instances of this script being executed from different paths, which might be an attempt to evade detection.\n\nThe image loaded events include .NET assemblies, which could be part of the payload. The file creation and deletion of a temporary script file might be part of the attack chain. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these PowerShell scripts and the registry changes points towards a potential security threat. The confidence is high because the presence of keystroke logging scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in temporary directories, combined with frequent registry modifications and file creation\/deletion events, indicates potential keystroke logging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs step by step. The user provided a series of system events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe being used. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines in some entries mention executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. The name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" immediately raises a red flag because keystroke logging is a typical behavior of keyloggers, which are malicious.\n\nNext, checking the file paths. The script paths are in directories that seem temporary or user-specific, like C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario and C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo. These could be part of a setup that's trying to hide its presence. Also, one of the files is in the Windows Defender directory, which might be an attempt to mimic legitimate processes or evade detection.\n\nOther events include file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating files in its data directory might be normal if it's part of configuration changes. However, svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization folder is less suspicious, but it's still worth noting. \n\nThere's also a Registry value set event, which could be part of configuration changes, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might indicate persistence mechanisms or changes to system settings.\n\nThe repetition of similar events, especially the multiple FileCreated entries for PowerShell, suggests ongoing activity. The presence of the same script names in different paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to deploy the keylogger in multiple locations or testing different paths.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign activities. For example, the winlogbeat file creation could be part of a legitimate configuration update. But the combination with the PowerShell scripts and the keystroke logging is concerning. \n\nAnother point is the use of \"Engine Lifecycle\" in the winlog task, which might relate to the execution of scripts as part of a larger process. The fact that the same script is referenced in different paths (C:\\elemento_base... and C:\\tarefa_base...) might be an attempt to obfuscate the true origin of the script.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of keystroke logging scripts executed via PowerShell, along with multiple file creations and registry changes, points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and the specific scripts used are strong indicators of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directories, a common tactic for keyloggers.
