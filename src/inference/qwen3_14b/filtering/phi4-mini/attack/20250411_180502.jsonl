So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see a powershell.exe process with a command line that starts another process using a batch file. The path here is \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\" which might be a bit suspicious because of the \"..\\\" which could indicate trying to access parent directories. But maybe that's just part of the normal path.\n\nLooking further, there are several events for powershell.exe loading images like clr.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are .NET and Windows Defender files, which are legitimate. However, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a sign of something trying to execute a script temporarily. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1. The deletion might be part of a cleanup, but sometimes malware does this to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe starting various batch files. The paths here are a bit obfuscated with \"..\\\" which might be an attempt to make the paths harder to track. Also, the command lines are similar, using Start-Process with different batch files. This repetition could indicate automated or scripted behavior, which isn't necessarily malicious but could be if it's part of an attack.\n\nOther processes like ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe having registry changes might be normal, but combined with the powershell activities, it's worth noting. However, the main concern here is the powershell.exe activities. The fact that there's a file created and deleted, along with multiple process creations and image loads, might indicate some form of script execution that's not entirely benign. But without more context, like the actual content of the batch files or the network destinations, it's hard to be certain. However, the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities involving script execution, temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of potentially legitimate but contextually suspicious DLLs (e.g., Windows Defender components).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of activity here. First, I notice that chrome.exe is involved in several Registry value set events. That's normal for Chrome, maybe updating settings or extensions. But then there's a command line entry for powershell.exe running a script from a path that looks a bit suspicious: \"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate trying to navigate up directories, which could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a process creation by cmd.exe executing another script: \"C:\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\estrutura_principal\\\\entrada_geral_script.bat\". These paths don't look standard. Also, powershell.exe is creating files in user directories, like \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\componente_principal.txt\" and \"elemento_base.txt\". While creating files isn't inherently bad, the combination with other events might be concerning.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are legitimate Windows Defender files. That seems okay. However, there's also a file created by svchost.exe in the DeliveryOptimization folder, which might be normal, but I need to check if that's part of a known process.\n\nThe repeated Registry events from chrome.exe could be normal, but the presence of multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes executing scripts from non-standard paths, along with file creations in user directories, might indicate some form of automated script execution. The use of \"..\" in the paths could be an attempt to obfuscate or access files outside the intended directory. However, without more context, like the content of the scripts or unusual network activity, it's a bit hard to tell. But considering the combination of these events, it's worth flagging as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and CMD processes executing scripts from non-standard paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat') with directory traversal ('..'), combined with file creation events in user directories, suggests potential malicious scripting activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
