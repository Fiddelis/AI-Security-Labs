{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. There's a lot of activity with processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe. The winlog events mention things like Process Create, Registry value set, and File created. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and processes being created. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's the use of reg.exe and cmd.exe to add entries to the registry under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. Adding entries to the Run key is a classic method for persistence, which is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one of them is using REG ADD to set a value that points to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\" and another to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". These could be malicious executables. Also, there's a file created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt\" by powershell.exe. While creating a text file isn't inherently bad, the combination with the registry modifications might indicate someone trying to install a backdoor or persistent access.\n\nAdditionally, winlogbeat.exe is creating files in its own directory, which might be normal if it's part of a legitimate log collection process. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and executable modifications makes me think there's some suspicious activity here. The repeated use of powershell and cmd to modify the registry and create files could be part of an attack chain. \n\nEven though there's no direct mention of network activity or obvious malware, the combination of these events—especially the registry persistence and file creation—suggests that this batch might be interesting for further investigation. The justification would be the suspicious registry modifications and the creation of files that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe to modify registry Run keys (potential persistence mechanism), creation of files in user downloads directory, and use of reg.exe to add suspicious registry entries pointing to executable files. These patterns are commonly associated with malware installation or persistence attempts.\"\n}"}
