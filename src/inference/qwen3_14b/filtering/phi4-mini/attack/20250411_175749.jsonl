{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with process and file as None. That's a bit suspicious because usually, if a remote command is executed, there should be some process involved. But maybe these are just placeholders or errors in the log. However, repeated entries might indicate something automated or a script.\n\nThen, there's a \"Process accessed\" for powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The next event is a \"Process Create\" for whoami.exe, which is a basic command to get user info. Not too suspicious on its own, but combined with others might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, there's a \"Registry value set\" by PowerShell, which could be modifying system settings. Then, a \"Process Create\" for cmd.exe with a command line that uses SCHTASKS to create a task named \"spawn\" that runs cmd.exe at 20:10. Creating a scheduled task might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nAnother event shows \"Image loaded\" for schtasks.exe with the path to taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, but the context here might be important. Then, a \"File created\" under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\spawn. Scheduled tasks in that directory are usually managed by the system, so a user-created task there could be a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple \"Registry value set\" events involving svchost.exe and conhost.exe. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but if it's modifying the registry, that might be unusual. The repetition of these events could indicate ongoing changes or attempts to evade detection.\n\nThe later entries again have \"Execute a Remote Command\" without process or file info. This repetition might be part of a pattern, maybe trying to overwhelm the system or test if the logs are being monitored.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch includes creating a scheduled task, modifying the registry, and using PowerShell and cmd.exe, which are common in attack chains. The creation of a task in the System32 directory and multiple registry modifications by svchost and conhost are suspicious. Even though some entries are just \"Execute a Remote Command\" without details, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the actions align with typical attack behaviors, even if some logs are incomplete.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of a scheduled task (spawn) via SCHTASKS, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe\/conhost.exe, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage patterns consistent with persistence mechanisms. The batch includes events that could indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user provided a batch of events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial entries: there are ten instances of \"Execute a Remote Command\" with no process or file details. That's unusual because typically, such events would have some process information. Maybe they're placeholders or errors, but repeated ten times might indicate a problem or a log collection issue. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNext, there's a \"Process Create\" event for WmiPrvSE.exe with a command line that includes \"-secured -Embedding\". WmiPrvSE.exe is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, which is normal, but the command line parameters might be worth checking. However, this alone isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, an \"Image loaded\" event for WmiPrvSE.exe loading wmiutils.dll from the system32 directory. That seems legitimate as well. But I should note that sometimes malicious software can disguise as legitimate DLLs.\n\nA \"File created\" event for winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the path is in the user's Downloads, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, without knowing the user's activities, it's hard to judge.\n\nThen there are several \"Registry value set\" events involving ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, PowerShell.exe, and Chrome.exe. Most of these are benign processes, but PowerShell and Chrome are common vectors for attacks. However, just setting registry values isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nA \"Process accessed\" event for PowerShell.exe. Again, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. Without more context, like the command being run, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere are multiple \"Pipe Created\" events for Chrome.exe and \"Image loaded\" events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal.\n\nSeveral \"Process Create\" events for svchost.exe with different parameters. Svchost.exe is a standard Windows process, so these are likely normal service host processes.\n\nA \"Logon\" event for services.exe, which is part of the Windows operating system, so that's expected.\n\nA \"File created\" event for PowerShell.exe creating a temporary text file. This could be part of normal operations, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the majority of events seem to be normal system activities. However, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without process details are suspicious. It could indicate a problem with the logging system or an attempt to obscure the actual processes involved. Additionally, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations, especially in user directories, might be worth investigating further. However, none of the events clearly point to a security threat on their own. The key here is that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but the anomalies in the logs might warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system activities and a few suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events (10 entries)**\n- **Observation**: 10 identical entries for \"Execute a Remote Command\" with **no process or file details**.\n- **Risk**: Unusual. Legitimate remote execution events typically include process information (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`). This repetition could indicate:\n  - **Log collection errors** (e.g., incomplete parsing).\n  - **Malicious activity** attempting to obfuscate the actual process (e.g., a hidden payload).\n- **Action**: Investigate the source of these logs (e.g., check for log integrity, verify if the system is under attack).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Legitimate System Processes**\n- **WmiPrvSE.exe** (Windows Management Instrumentation):\n  - Command line: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p -s NgcSvc`.\n  - **Analysis**: Normal for Windows management tasks, but the `-p` (process isolation) and `-s` (service) flags may warrant closer inspection if unexpected.\n- **svchost.exe**:\n  - Multiple entries with different service groups (e.g., `LocalSystemNetworkRestricted`, `LocalServiceNetworkRestricted`).\n  - **Analysis**: Standard for hosting Windows services; no immediate concern unless correlated with unusual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **3. File Creation Events**\n- **Winlogbeat**:\n  - File: `modulo_temporario.txt` created by `powershell.exe` in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`.\n  - **Analysis**: `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log shipper, but the file name (`modulo_temporario.txt`) is generic. If this is part of normal operations, itâ€™s benign. However, **user-directory file creation by PowerShell** could be a red flag if unexplained.\n- **Other files**:\n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_temporario.txt` (created by PowerShell).\n  - **Analysis**: Requires context (e.g., was this file manually created or generated by a script?).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Registry Modifications**\n- **Processes Involved**: `chrome.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`.\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Chrome.exe** modifying the registry is common (e.g., for extensions or settings).\n  - **PowerShell.exe** and **ApplicationFrameHost.exe** are often used for legitimate tasks but can also be exploited. However, **no specific malicious registry keys** are indicated here.\n  - **Action**: Correlate with other events (e.g., check if these changes are tied to unexpected applications or user actions).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Image Load Events**\n- **Chrome.exe** loading `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll`:\n  - **Analysis**: These are legitimate Windows Defender components. No concern here.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Logon Event**\n- **Process**: `services.exe` (part of the Windows operating system).\n- **Analysis**: Normal for system boot processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **No clear evidence of malicious activity**, but **anomalies** exist:\n  - Repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries with missing data.\n  - File creation in user directories by PowerShell (requires context).\n- **Recommendations**:\n  1. **Investigate the source** of the 10 \"Execute a Remote Command\" logs (e.g., check for log tampering or incomplete data).\n  2. **Monitor the user account** (`fiddelis`) for unusual file activity or PowerShell scripts.\n  3. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, process tree) to determine if these events are part of a larger pattern.\n\n**Overall Risk**: **Low to Medium** (normal system activity with a few suspicious anomalies that need further investigation)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries with the task 'Execute a Remote Command' and no process or file details. That's a red flag because executing remote commands without any context could be part of an attack, like a remote code execution exploit.\n\nThen there's a 'Process Create' event for WmiPrvSE.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, but the command line includes '-secured -Embedding'. I know that WmiPrvSE is used by Windows Management Instrumentation, and the parameters here might be normal. But I should check if this is a known legitimate use or if it's being abused.\n\nNext, there's an 'Image loaded' event for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware features, and MpOAV.dll is part of Microsoft Defender. That seems normal, but if an attacker is trying to bypass AMSI, it could be a sign of malicious activity. However, the log just shows the image being loaded, which is a normal process.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for chrome.exe. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's doing some configuration changes. However, if this is a legitimate user activity, like installing extensions, it might not be harmful. But if the registry changes are related to malicious behavior, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a 'File created' event for winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper used in ELK stacks, so creating a configuration file is normal. But if the file is being created in an unusual location or by an unexpected process, that could be suspicious. Here, the path seems to be a standard download directory, so maybe it's a legitimate installation.\n\nAnother 'File created' event by powershell.exe for a temporary text file. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, so creating a file might be normal. However, if the file contains malicious content, that's a concern. But the log only mentions the file name, not its contents.\n\nLooking at the repetition of 'Registry value set' for chrome.exe, maybe the user is doing something with Chrome that's causing multiple registry writes. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the initial 'Execute a Remote Command' events. Those could indicate an attack vector. The other events might be legitimate, but the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations could be part of a larger attack. However, there's not enough evidence here to confirm a security incident. It's possible that some of these are normal operations, but the 'Execute a Remote Command' entries are definitely something to investigate further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events**:\n  - **10+ entries** with `task: \"Execute a Remote Command\"` and no process\/file context.\n  - **Indication**: This could signal **unauthorized remote access** or **exploitation** (e.g., via RDP, PowerShell, or WMI).\n  - **Risk**: High. If these commands are executed by an attacker, they may be **installing malware**, **exfiltrating data**, or **pivoting within the network**.\n\n- **\"File Created\" by `powershell.exe`**:\n  - A temporary file `modulo_temporario.txt` is created in a user's download directory.\n  - **Indication**: PowerShell is often used for scripting, but the **lack of context** (e.g., file content, command line) makes this **ambiguous**. Could be benign or part of an attack (e.g., logging, data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Legitimate Activity**\n- **`WmiPrvSE.exe` Process Creation**:\n  - Command line: `svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p -s NgcSvc`.\n  - **Context**: This is a **legitimate Windows process** used for WMI operations. The parameters suggest **network-related services** (e.g., Windows Update, remote management).\n  - **Note**: Requires further analysis (e.g., parent process, network traffic) to confirm legitimacy.\n\n- **`chrome.exe` Image Loads**:\n  - **Amsi.dll** and **MpOAV.dll** are loaded (Windows Defender components).\n  - **Context**: Normal behavior for Chrome interacting with system security tools. **No immediate risk**.\n\n- **`winlogbeat.exe` File Creation**:\n  - A configuration file (`.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is created in a typical download directory.\n  - **Context**: Winlogbeat is a **log shipper** (used in ELK stacks). This may be a **legitimate installation** or **misconfigured**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags**\n- **Repetition of \"Registry Value Set\" Events**:\n  - **20+ entries** for `chrome.exe` modifying registry values.\n  - **Indication**: Chrome typically does not modify the registry. This could signal **malware persistence** (e.g., registry keys for startup, hooks, or configuration).\n  - **Risk**: Medium. Requires checking the **specific registry keys** modified.\n\n- **Lack of Context**:\n  - Many entries lack **process command-line arguments**, **user context**, or **network activity**, making it **difficult to determine intent**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events**:\n   - Check **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., `Security` logs for `4688` events) for details on the commands executed.\n   - Use **SIEM tools** (e.g., Splunk, ELK) to correlate with network traffic or user activity.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry Modifications**:\n   - Use tools like **RegRipper** to inspect the registry keys modified by `chrome.exe` for signs of **malware persistence** or **tampering**.\n\n3. **Inspect PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Check the **content of `modulo_temporario.txt`** and the **PowerShell command-line arguments** (e.g., via `Get-Process` or `Get-WinEvent`).\n\n4. **Verify Winlogbeat Installation**:\n   - Confirm if the `.yml` file is part of a **legitimate ELK stack deployment** or if it was **downloaded unexpectedly**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is **normal** (e.g., WMI, Chrome, Winlogbeat), the **repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events** and **unusual registry modifications** warrant **further investigation**. This could indicate **compromise**, **misconfiguration**, or **legitimate but poorly monitored activity**."}
