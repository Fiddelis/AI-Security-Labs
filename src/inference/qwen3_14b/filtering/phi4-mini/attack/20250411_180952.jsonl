{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing a DNS query, chrome.exe making network connections. Those seem normal. Chrome often connects to the internet, and svchost is a common system process. But then there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually benign but could be part of something malicious if used inappropriately. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a red flag. Let me check the command lines. One of the cmd.exe entries has a command to add a user with a domain and a password that looks like a temporary password. The command is \"net user pacote_principal_Admin registro_temporario_pass123! \/add \/domain & net group Domain Admins elemento_comum_Admin \/add \/domain\". Adding a user to the Domain Admins group is a big deal. That's a clear sign of someone trying to escalate privileges or set up a backdoor.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used to add users and groups. The presence of both net.exe and net1.exe is suspicious. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool; it might be a typo or a malicious binary masquerading as a legitimate one. That's a strong indicator of compromise.\n\nThen there's the file creation events. Winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which might be part of configuration changes. PowerShell creating a pacote_base.txt file. Not sure yet, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of data exfiltration or setup.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for adding users and modifying registry values points to potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. The addition of users to Domain Admins is a critical security issue. Even though some processes are normal (like svchost.exe and chrome.exe), the combination of these commands and the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe makes this batch highly suspicious.\n\nSo, the classification should be INTERESTING. The justification is the suspicious commands adding domain admins and using non-standard tools. Confidence is high, maybe 0.95, because the evidence is strong.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin users via 'net' commands, use of non-standard executable 'net1.exe', repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe commands modifying system settings, and potential credential creation (e.g., 'registro_temporario_pass123!'). These indicate possible privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
