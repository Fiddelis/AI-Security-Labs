{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so probably not a red flag. But then I see powershell.exe appearing multiple times. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but the events here might be significant.\n\nLooking at one of the PowerShell entries, there's a command line that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used for enumerating user accounts, groups, and other system information. That's a classic sign of an attacker trying to gather information about the system, which is part of the reconnaissance phase in an attack.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell pointing to .NET Framework DLLs. While some of these are legitimate, the presence of multiple image loads, especially from the Microsoft.NET directory, might indicate that the attacker is using .NET-based payloads or tools. However, I should check if these are standard system files. The paths listed like C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\clr.dll are legitimate, but the combination with other suspicious activities might be a concern.\n\nAnother notable event is the File Create and subsequent File Delete events for a temporary PowerShell script. The script is created in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. However, the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted could be an attempt to hide the script's existence. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be a misleading name to avoid detection, but that's speculative. Still, the creation and deletion of a script in a temporary directory could be part of an attack, especially if the script contains malicious code.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle events are probably just system logs and not directly indicative of malicious activity. However, the repetition of the same command line in multiple Provider Lifecycle events might indicate that the PowerShell process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell process is performing system enumeration, which is a common attack technique. The creation and deletion of a temporary script might be part of an attack, especially if the script was used to execute malicious commands. However, without seeing the actual content of the script, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these activities suggests that this could be a legitimate user running a script, or it could be an attacker probing the system.\n\nSince the logs show multiple suspicious activities related to PowerShell and system enumeration, this batch of logs is worth investigating further. The presence of these events, especially the file creation and deletion, along with the system enumeration commands, indicates a potential security incident. Therefore, the answer should be that this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **PowerShell Enumeration Commands**  \n   - The `powershell.exe` process repeatedly executes commands like:  \n     ```  \n     net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, net localgroup  \n     ```  \n     These commands are **common in post-exploitation reconnaissance** to gather system\/user information, which is a hallmark of an attacker mapping a target.\n\n2. **Temporary Script Creation & Deletion**  \n   - A script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`) is created in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory and then immediately deleted.  \n   - This pattern is often used to **evade detection** by removing evidence of malicious activity after execution.\n\n3. **Repetition of \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**  \n   - The same PowerShell command line is logged multiple times under \"Provider Lifecycle\" events. This could indicate **logging or monitoring tools** being triggered, but the repetition may also suggest **script-based automation** or **malicious persistence mechanisms**.\n\n4. **Legitimate .NET DLLs in Image Loads**  \n   - While the loaded .NET DLLs (e.g., `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.dll`) are legitimate, their presence in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity could indicate the use of **.NET-based payloads** or tools for further exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- The combination of **system enumeration**, **temporary script creation**, and **repeated logging** suggests **active probing or lateral movement** by an attacker.  \n- The use of PowerShell for such activities is **common in red team operations** and **malware execution**, especially in environments where PowerShell is not tightly restricted.  \n- The script's deletion after execution raises concerns about **evasion tactics** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check the content of the deleted script** (if possible via forensic analysis) to identify its purpose.  \n2. **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, file system changes) to determine if data was exfiltrated or if the attacker moved laterally.  \n3. **Review PowerShell execution policies** and **audit logs** to detect unauthorized script execution.  \n4. **Investigate user accounts** (e.g., `net user` output) for signs of compromised credentials or unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThis log batch **merits immediate investigation** due to the indicators of reconnaissance, potential script-based attacks, and evasion tactics. While some activity (e.g., Chrome's DNS queries) is benign, the PowerShell-related events strongly suggest a **potential security incident**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of PowerShell commands. The command_line in one of the entries is using PowerShell to run a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups. That's a red flag because that's typical of reconnaissance activities, which are often part of an attack.\n\nThen, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but if it's creating a new configuration file (.yml.new), maybe that's normal. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity around that. The path is in the Downloads folder, which might be less suspicious, but not necessarily.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of chrome.exe with registry value set events. Multiple entries here. Chrome modifying registry values could be normal if it's updating settings, but if it's done multiple times in a short period, it might be part of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the number of entries here is high, so maybe that's worth noting.\n\nThere's also a process called SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. SDXHelper is part of some software, but loading combase.dll is a standard system DLL. Not sure if that's suspicious here. The other entries for net.exe and net1.exe running user and localgroup commands are typical for checking user accounts and groups, which again points to reconnaissance.\n\nThe presence of both net.exe and net1.exe is interesting. Net1.exe isn't a standard Windows tool. That might be a typo or a renamed malicious executable. That's a possible indicator of compromise. If someone is using net1.exe instead of the standard net.exe, that's suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a cmdkey.exe \/list command. Cmdkey is used to manage stored credentials. Listing them could be part of an attack to steal credentials. So that's another red flag.\n\nThe PowerShell script is run multiple times, and it's using a lot of commands to gather system information. That's consistent with an attacker trying to map out the network and user accounts. The creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder might be an attempt to set up persistence or modify startup scripts.\n\nPutting this all together, the main concerns are the PowerShell reconnaissance, the use of non-standard executables like net1.exe, and the cmdkey \/list command. These activities are commonly seen in initial stages of cyber attacks. While some processes are legitimate, the combination and frequency here suggest potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential reconnaissance or malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n### **1. PowerShell Reconnaissance Script**\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {net user; get-localuser; get-localgroupmember -group Users; cmdkey.exe \/list; ls C:\/Users; get-childitem C:\\Users; dir C:\\Users; get-localgroup; net localgroup}\n  ```\n- **Indicators**:\n  - **Reconnaissance**: The script gathers system information (users, groups, credentials, file listings), typical of an attacker mapping a target.\n  - **cmdkey \/list**: Attempts to list stored credentials, which could be an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data.\n  - **Repeated Execution**: The same script appears in multiple entries, suggesting persistence or automated scanning.\n\n### **2. Unusual Executable: `net1.exe`**\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1.exe localgroup\n  ```\n- **Indicators**:\n  - **Non-Standard Tool**: `net1.exe` is not a legitimate Windows utility. This could be a renamed malicious executable or a typo (e.g., confusion with `net.exe`).\n  - **Potential Malware**: The presence of `net1.exe` raises concerns about unauthorized tools being used on the system.\n\n### **3. File Creation in User Directories**\n- **Example**:\n  - File created by `winlogbeat.exe`: `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.\n- **Indicators**:\n  - **PowerShell Persistence**: Creating files in the `StartupProfileData` directory could indicate an attempt to modify startup scripts or establish persistence.\n  - **Winlogbeat**: While legitimate, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in a non-standard location (e.g., `Downloads` or user directories) may warrant scrutiny.\n\n### **4. Frequent Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`**\n- **Entries**:\n  - Multiple `Registry value set` events linked to `chrome.exe`.\n- **Indicators**:\n  - **Abnormal Behavior**: Chrome typically does not modify system-wide registry keys. Frequent changes could indicate tampering or malware injection.\n\n### **5. SDXHelper.exe Loading `combase.dll`**\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```powershell\n  SDXHelper.exe loading C:\\Windows\\System32\\combase.dll\n  ```\n- **Indicators**:\n  - **Legitimacy**: `combase.dll` is a legitimate system DLL, but its loading by `SDXHelper.exe` (associated with some software) should be validated. If `SDXHelper.exe` is not expected on the system, this could be suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe log entries contain **multiple red flags**, including:\n- **Reconnaissance via PowerShell**.\n- **Unusual executables** (`net1.exe`).\n- **Potential persistence mechanisms** (file creation in user directories).\n- **Abnormal registry activity**.\n\n**Action Required**: \n- Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and `net1.exe`.\n- Validate the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` and its interaction with `combase.dll`.\n- Monitor for credential theft via `cmdkey \/list`.\n- Check for unauthorized changes to system files and registry keys.\n\nThis batch of logs is **highly suspicious** and should be prioritized for further analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: conhost.exe with a registry value set. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, so that might not be an issue. The second event is SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process, and urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, which is used for handling URLs. If SDXHelper is a legitimate application, this might be normal, but if not, it could be malicious. However, there's no immediate red flag here.\n\nThird event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory seems normal. The fourth event is powershell.exe creating a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Creating a text file isn't suspicious on its own, but the name is generic.\n\nNext, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe being run with command line arguments. The command line mentions \"installsource scheduler,\" which could be part of a scheduled update. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate is a legitimate process, so this might be normal. However, the next event shows the same process loading taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler, which is legitimate, but loading it from a non-standard location (SysWOW64) might be a red flag if it's not expected.\n\nThen, powershell.exe again modifying the registry. PowerShell interacting with the registry can be part of normal administrative tasks, but if it's making unexpected changes, that's suspicious. The last event is a ProcessAccess by PowerShell, which might indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate another process.\n\nPutting this all together: There are a few events involving PowerShell and registry changes, which can be signs of malicious activity. The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll might be benign, but the combination of multiple PowerShell events and the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate process loading Task Scheduler DLL could indicate something is amiss. However, there's not enough concrete evidence like file modifications, network activity, or known malicious hashes to confirm a breach. The presence of multiple events that are somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious might suggest a low to moderate risk. So, the batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation, but not highly suspicious. Confidence would be around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell interacting with registry and creating files, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll (unusual for this process), and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loading taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. While some processes are legitimate, the combination of events suggests potential malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
