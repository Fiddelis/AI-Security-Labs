There are multiple instances of ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, and Registry value set events. Also, there's a File created and then immediately deleted. The file path is in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to use for temporary files. \n\nThe command line for one of the processes is \"powershell.exe & {}\", which seems a bit odd.

That's not inherently bad, but if combined with other actions, it might be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThe fact that the same process (powershell.exe) is creating and deleting a file in the Temp directory could be a red flag.

However, without more context, it's a bit tricky. But given the patterns, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **`powershell.exe`** is involved in multiple events, including:\n     - **File creation and immediate deletion** in the Temp directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1`). This is a common tactic for malware to execute scripts and clean up traces.\n     - **Suspicious command lines** like `powershell.exe & {}`, which hides console output and could mask malicious actions.\n     - **Image load events** for .NET assemblies (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`), which may be part of legitimate processes but could also indicate code injection or exploit attempts.\n\n2. **Unusual File Operations**:\n   - A temporary file is created and deleted rapidly, which is often seen in **malware execution chains** to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Provider\/Engine Lifecycle Events**:\n   - Repeated entries with `Provider Lifecycle` or `Engine Lifecycle` tasks for `powershell.exe` suggest **unusual PowerShell execution contexts**, possibly related to script obfuscation or evasion techniques.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple **`Registry value set`** events and **`Pipe Created`** events could indicate attempts to modify system behavior or establish covert communication channels.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**\n- **Legitimate Activity**: Some events (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe` creating a `.yml.new` file) may be part of **log collection tools** or user-initiated actions. However, the **volume and pattern** of PowerShell-related events raise red flags.\n- **User Context**: The file path (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) suggests the activity is tied to a user account (possibly `fiddelis`), which could be a **compromised user** or a **malicious insider**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for **network traffic** from `powershell.exe` (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Investigate **user activity** for `fiddelis` (e.g., login times, privilege level, recent file access).\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - If the deleted file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) was recovered, analyze its contents for malicious payloads (e.g., PowerShell obfuscation, command-line arguments).\n\n3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Look for **scheduled tasks, registry keys, or services** created by `powershell.exe` that could indicate **persistence**.\n\n4. **Monitor .NET Assemblies**:\n   - Investigate the loaded .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) to ensure they are legitimate and not tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile not definitive proof of a breach, the **combination of PowerShell anomalies, temporary file operations, and lifecycle events** strongly suggests **potential malicious activity**. This warrants immediate investigation by a security team or SOC analyst."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag if there's too much going on. Let me check the specific events. The first event mentions an image loaded for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I should note that.\n\nThen there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Next, there are several registry value set events. Registry changes can be a sign of something trying to modify system settings, but again, not always malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines for PowerShell, they all seem to be checking if certain paths exist and exiting with 0 or 1. That could be part of a script that's checking for the presence of files. However, the paths mentioned are a bit odd. They have a lot of \"C:\\...\" with directories that look like they might be obfuscated or trying to avoid detection. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the \"..\\\\\" suggests they're navigating up directories, which might be a way to reference files in a different location without directly exposing the path. That's a technique sometimes used in malicious scripts.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is normal when running .NET applications. But if PowerShell is loading these, maybe it's executing .NET code, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition of similar PowerShell commands. They all use Test-Path to check for the existence of specific .bat files. If these files are not present, the script exits with 1. This could be part of a legitimate script that's trying to ensure certain files exist before proceeding. However, the fact that there are so many different paths being checked might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files, perhaps to determine the environment or to look for existing scripts that can be exploited.\n\nAlso, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a PowerShell script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to testing script execution policies. That could be part of a legitimate test, but it's also possible that this is part of a process to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nPutting this all together, while some of these events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs or creating temporary files), the combination of multiple Test-Path checks for potentially obfuscated paths, the creation of a temporary script file, and the numerous registry changes might indicate a more complex activity. It's possible that this is a legitimate script, but the patterns observed are also consistent with reconnaissance or setup steps for a more malicious payload. Therefore, this batch of events seems suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a mix of normal system behavior and patterns that could indicate potential malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Frequent Use:** PowerShell is used extensively, which is common but can be a vector for attacks if misused.\n   - **Script Behavior:** Multiple `Test-Path` commands check for the existence of `.bat` files in obfuscated or seemingly arbitrary paths (e.g., `C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat`). The use of `..` in paths may indicate obfuscation or attempts to evade detection.\n   - **Exit Codes:** Scripts exit with `0` or `1` based on file presence, suggesting conditional logic that could be part of a larger payload or reconnaissance phase.\n\n2. **File and Registry Activity:**\n   - **File Creation:** A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might relate to testing or bypassing PowerShell execution policies.\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Multiple `Registry value set` events could indicate attempts to alter system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **DLL Loading:**\n   - **.NET DLLs:** Normal .NET components (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded, which is expected during PowerShell execution involving .NET code. However, the frequency and context of these loads may warrant scrutiny.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Obfuscated Paths:** The use of `..` in paths (e.g., `..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat`) may indicate attempts to hide the true location of files or evade detection.\n- **Repetitive Script Checks:** The repeated use of `Test-Path` across multiple paths could be probing the system for specific files or assessing the environment for exploitation opportunities.\n- **Temporary Script File:** The creation of a script in the `Temp` directory with a name suggesting policy testing could be a precursor to executing malicious code under the guise of legitimate tests.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., .NET DLL loading) is benign, the combination of obfuscated paths, repetitive script checks, and temporary file creation raises **red flags**. These patterns are consistent with **reconnaissance or pre-execution steps** for a potential attack. Further investigation is warranted, including:\n- Analyzing the content of the temporary script file.\n- Checking for additional malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.\n- Correlating these events with other system logs (e.g., process creation, network activity).\n\n**Recommendation:** Flag this activity for deeper analysis and consider isolating the affected system if malicious intent is suspected."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: PowerShell.exe is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but deleting a script might be normal. However, the filename has a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Maybe it's just cleaning up, but sometimes attackers delete their own scripts to cover tracks.\n\nNext, there's a file creation in the Downloads folder. That's less suspicious, but again, depends on context. Then, there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of registry changes could be normal, but if it's a lot, maybe something's going on. However, Chrome might legitimately modify registry settings for its own operations.\n\nThen, there's a PowerShell process checking if certain .bat files exist. The paths here look a bit odd. For example, \"modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\..\\\" might be navigating directories. The use of ..\\ could be trying to access parent directories, which isn't necessarily bad, but sometimes used in path traversal attacks. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother entry shows PowerShell creating a new item and setting content. The command line here is more explicit: New-Item and Set-Content with a path that ends in a .bat file. The content is \"dir\", which is a simple command. Maybe it's creating a script, but again, could be benign. However, creating files in various directories might be part of setting up something.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading several DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate the process is doing more than usual. However, Defender's DLLs are legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a mix of file operations (create, delete), registry changes, and process activities. The PowerShell activities involve creating and checking files in various directories. While some of these could be normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to modify the system or execute scripts. The fact that multiple files are being created and checked, especially with paths that use ..\\, might suggest an attempt to manipulate the file system in a way that's not typical for regular user activities.\n\nHowever, without more context like the user's normal behavior, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the presence of multiple suspicious activities, even if individually they might be benign, when combined could indicate a potential security incident. The confidence is medium because while there are indicators of compromise, they aren't definitive on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The logs show PowerShell performing multiple file operations (create, delete) in system directories, registry modifications, and loading various DLLs. While some activities are normal, the combination of file manipulation in non-standard paths (e.g., using '..\\\\') and repeated process interactions raises suspicion. The creation of batch files with simple commands (e.g., 'dir') could indicate preparatory steps for further actions. However, no direct malicious activity is confirmed without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"MEDIUM\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the process commands, there are several instances of PowerShell scripts creating files and setting their content. The command lines use New-Item and Set-Content, which are typical for creating files and writing to them. The paths mentioned are all over the place, some in system directories and others in user-specific temp folders. \n\nI notice that in the first few entries, the PowerShell commands are creating .bat files in various directories, like C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\.. and so on. The paths have some parent directory references (like ..\\), which might be a way to navigate the file system. But I need to check if these are normal or suspicious. \n\nThen there's an entry where a file is created in the user's Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. But then there's a File Delete logged event for the same file, which might be part of a normal process, but maybe not. Also, there's a Pipe Created event, which could be normal, but sometimes pipes are used in malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are entries where registry values are set. PowerShell accessing the registry isn't necessarily bad, but if it's modifying certain keys, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Image Load events mention loading .dll files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal for PowerShell when running .NET code, so that's probably not suspicious.\n\nNow, the key point here is that multiple PowerShell processes are creating files in various locations, some of which might be unusual. However, the fact that they're using the file system to create and modify files could be part of legitimate scripting tasks. But the repetition of these actions across different directories might indicate something more. \n\nWait, but in the PowerShell command line, there's one that checks if a file exists and exits with 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's verifying the presence of a file, which could be normal. However, combined with the other file creation and modification events, it's possible that this is part of a larger process, maybe installing software or configuring something. \n\nBut the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. The presence of multiple file creations, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell for these actions could be indicative of either legitimate administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities. However, without more context, such as the content of the files created or the specific registry keys modified, it's hard to be certain. \n\nIn a typical security analysis, multiple PowerShell activities that create files and modify the registry might be flagged for further investigation, especially if they're happening in a non-interactive session or if the files are in unusual locations. However, in this case, some of the paths are in standard locations like the user's Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this batch of events is worth investigating further. The combination of file creation, registry changes, and multiple PowerShell processes could be a sign of something that needs closer examination, even if it's not definitively malicious. The answer should reflect that this is suspicious enough to warrant further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, as they may indicate either legitimate administrative activity or potential malicious behavior. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell File Creation:**\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes are creating `.bat` files in non-standard or system directories (e.g., `C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..`), often with parent directory references (`..\\`). This could be an attempt to obscure file paths or access restricted areas.\n   - Example:  \n     ```powershell\n     New-Item -Path \"C:\\registro_geral\\componente_ativo\\..\\\" -ItemType File\n     Set-Content -Path \"C:\\entrada_comum\\tarefa_comum\\..\\\" -Value \"dir\"\n     ```\n   - While file creation is common, the **frequency** and **distribution across directories** raise concerns.\n\n2. **File Creation and Deletion in Temp Folders:**\n   - A file is created in the user's temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and later deleted. This could be part of a normal process, but the **lack of context** (e.g., why the file was deleted) is concerning.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest changes to system or user-specific registry keys. While registry edits are not inherently malicious, **unauthorized or unexpected modifications** could indicate tampering.\n\n4. **Unusual Image Loads:**\n   - PowerShell processes load `.dll` files associated with the .NET framework (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`). While this is normal for .NET-based operations, the **combination with other events** (e.g., file creation, registry changes) may indicate deeper system manipulation.\n\n5. **Script Logic for File Existence Check:**\n   - A PowerShell script checks if a specific file exists (`Test-Path \"C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..\\\"`) and exits with `0` or `1`. This could be part of a **conditional workflow** (e.g., verifying prerequisites), but the **lack of transparency** in the script's purpose is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Legitimate Explanations:**\n- **Automated Scripting:** The activity could be part of a legitimate deployment, configuration, or cleanup process (e.g., installing software, updating scripts).\n- **User-Initiated Actions:** If the user is an administrator, these events might reflect intentional system management tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation:**\n1. **Analyze File Contents:**\n   - Examine the `.bat` files created (e.g., `objeto_comum_script.bat`) to determine their purpose and whether they contain malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscated code, command-line arguments).\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for associated **network activity** (e.g., PowerShell downloading files from external sources) or **user behavior** (e.g., login context, permissions).\n\n3. **Check for PowerShell Script Signing:**\n   - Verify if the scripts are digitally signed by a trusted entity, which could indicate legitimacy.\n\n4. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:**\n   - Investigate if the scripts are configured to run at startup or through scheduled tasks (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the combination of **repeated file creation, registry modifications, and PowerShell usage** in non-standard contexts is **suspicious enough to warrant further analysis**. This could be a red flag for **script-based attacks, configuration tampering, or insider activity**. A deeper forensic review is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple PowerShell processes running with command lines that check for the existence of certain batch files. The paths mentioned are a bit odd. For example, paths like \"C:\\objeto_logico\\elemento_logico\\..\\elemento_base\\pacote_temporario_script.bat\" have some directory traversals with \"..\\\", which might be trying to access parent directories. But wait, that's a common way to navigate the file system, so maybe not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that there are so many similar commands checking different paths could be a red flag. Why are they checking so many different files?\n\nLooking further, there are entries about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory. For example, a file named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\" is created and then deleted. That might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but if it's happening multiple times or in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be something else. Also, there's a mention of \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate if it's part of a monitoring setup. But I should check if there are any other unusual processes.\n\nThen there's the \"whoami.exe\" process, which is a standard tool to get the current user's identity. That's normal, but if it's being used in a context where it shouldn't be, maybe. However, there's no indication of that here.\n\nAnother point is the multiple instances of PowerShell processes with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These tasks might be related to the PowerShell provider, which is part of the normal operation. However, the sheer number of such events could be a sign of something automated or scripted.\n\nI also see entries about image loading, like \"MpOAV.dll\" and \"MpClient.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus software, so that's normal. But if there were any unexpected DLLs loaded, that would be a concern.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious parts are the numerous PowerShell commands checking for the existence of various files in different directories. This could be a sign of an attacker trying to determine if certain malicious files are present or trying to execute them. However, without seeing actual execution of those files or any other malicious activities (like network connections to bad IPs, unusual registry changes, etc.), it's hard to confirm. The fact that the files are being checked but not executed might be benign, like a script verifying prerequisites. But in a real-world scenario, this pattern might warrant further investigation to ensure that these checks aren't part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Legitimate PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and file creation\/deletion in temporary directories (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1`) are common in PowerShell scripting for testing or automation.\n   - Windows Defender DLLs (`MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`) being loaded are expected during antivirus operations.\n\n2. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - The `.winlogbeat.yml.new` file creation is consistent with log configuration updates in a monitoring setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell `Test-Path` Commands**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes check for the existence of files in non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\\objeto_logico\\...`). While directory traversal (`..\\`) is normal, the **volume and diversity of paths** (e.g., `estrutura_secundario\\bin\\entrada_base.exe`, `modulo_ativo\\bin\\estrutura_base.exe`) suggest **probing for specific executables**.\n   - This pattern is **consistent with malware reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for payloads, configuration files, or exploit targets).\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directories**:\n   - The temporary file `__PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1` is created and deleted. While this could be benign, **frequent creation\/deletion of transient files** in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell` might indicate **script obfuscation or evasion techniques**.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Purpose**:\n   - The absence of actual file execution, network activity, or registry changes makes it **unclear whether these checks are benign or part of a larger attack chain** (e.g., pre-staging for lateral movement or data exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Additional Data**:\n  - Check for **subsequent execution of the files** referenced in `Test-Path` commands (e.g., `entrada_base.exe`, `estrutura_base.exe`).\n  - Investigate **network traffic** during these events for connections to suspicious IPs or domains.\n  - Review **registry modifications** or **process injections** that might follow these checks.\n\n- **Contextual Analysis**:\n  - Determine if the user (`fiddelis`) has **administrative privileges** or access to sensitive systems.\n  - Check if these activities align with **legitimate workflows** (e.g., software deployment, testing).\n\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - If these checks are **unauthorized or unexpected**, block the PowerShell commands or restrict access to sensitive directories.\n  - Monitor for **unusual PowerShell usage** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`) in conjunction with these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **repetitive probing of files** and **transient file operations** warrant further investigation. These behaviors are **consistent with initial access or reconnaissance phases** of an attack but could also be part of a legitimate process. Contextual analysis and correlation with other logs are critical to determine intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell processes. There are several instances of PowerShell executing commands that check if certain files exist. For example, the command lines have Test-Path checks for files in various directories, then exit 0 or 1 based on that. These might be checking for the presence of specific executables, but just checking for files isn't necessarily malicious. However, the repetition of such checks across different paths could be a pattern worth noting.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there's a mix of Process Create, Process Access, Image Load, File Create, and Registry events. The Image Load events mention loading DLLs like mscoree.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, the File Create and Delete events involve temporary files, which might be part of normal PowerShell operations, like script execution or policy testing. The presence of a file being created and then immediately deleted could be a red flag, but it's also common in some benign scenarios.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe' in the logs. The whoami command is usually benign, just returning user information. The cmd.exe instance is checking if a file exists in the temp directory. Again, that's a simple check, but combined with the multiple PowerShell events, it might indicate some automated checks or scripts running.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The main thing is the repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files. If these files are part of a legitimate process, then it's not an issue. However, if the paths mentioned (like C:\\entrada_secundario, C:\\registro_principal, etc.) are unusual or not part of standard system directories, that might be suspicious. The fact that the same pattern is repeated with different file paths could indicate an attempt to check for the presence of malicious files or to probe the system for certain components.\n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The key points are: multiple PowerShell processes checking for files, some temporary file creation and deletion, and various process and registry events. However, without seeing the actual files or more context, it's hard to be certain. The presence of these events alone might not be enough to flag as malicious, but the combination could be indicative of something. Since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, the answer would lean towards yes, because the pattern is unusual and could be part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of tools or exfiltrating data. But I need to make sure not to overstate it. The confidence here is moderate, not high, because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, just suspicious patterns.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows repeated PowerShell activity involving file existence checks (`Test-Path`) across non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\entrada_secundario`, `C:\\registro_principal`). While individual checks are not inherently malicious, the **repetition of this pattern** across multiple paths and the involvement of temporary file creation\/deletion (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`, `objeto_logico.txt`) could indicate **probing or automated scripting**. Combined with frequent `ProcessAccess` and `RegistryEvent` logs, this warrants further investigation to rule out **malicious reconnaissance** or **script-based attacks**. \n\n**Confidence level**: Moderate. The activity is not definitively malicious but exhibits suspicious patterns requiring closer analysis. \n\n**Key flags**: \n- Repeated PowerShell `Test-Path` checks for non-standard files.\n- Temporary file creation\/deletion (possibly for exfiltration or script execution).\n- High frequency of process\/registry interactions."}

That's common, but when combined with other events, it might be a red flag. There are multiple instances of 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events. The 'Image loaded' events include paths like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That's normal, but then there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe the presence here is just part of normal operations.\n\nWait, there's a 'File created' and then immediately 'File Delete logged' for a temporary script file. That could be part of a script execution that's being cleaned up. But why create and delete it? Maybe it's just a temporary file, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving evidence. However, the command lines for PowerShell are checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths like 'C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...' don't look like standard system paths. They might be trying to access files in custom directories, which could be part of a malicious script checking for the presence of certain files.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with different paths might indicate that PowerShell is being used to check for specific files, which could be part of a larger attack.

The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate command, so that's not suspicious.\n\nBut considering the combination of multiple PowerShell events, checking for specific files, and the temporary file creation and deletion, it's possible that this is a benign script, but it's also possible that it's part of a more complex attack.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The first event mentions an image loaded from the Windows Defender directory, which might be normal, but then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. Then there are registry value sets and process accesses. Hmm, but some of these might be part of normal operations, like PowerShell scripts running.\n\nWait, then I see several entries where PowerShell is checking for the existence of a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The command lines all have a similar structure: if the file exists, exit 0, else exit 1. That seems suspicious. Why would someone check for this specific file multiple times across different directories? It could be part of a script that's trying to locate a keystroke logger module, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple process accesses and image loads. The image loads include some .dll files from Windows Defender, which might be legitimate, but the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 are concerning. The file creation and deletion in the Temp folder could be part of a script trying to execute something temporarily, but then deleting it. That's a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother point is the use of PowerShell for these operations. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple instances of checking for the same script file in different paths might indicate that the attacker is trying to find where the keystroke logger is stored, possibly to execute it or check if it's present.\n\nThe confidence here would be medium to high. The repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across different directories suggest potential malicious intent, especially if combined with process accesses and file operations. However, without more context, like the actual content of the files or further network activity, it's a bit tricky. But the pattern of checking for a specific script in multiple locations is a strong indicator of something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Patterns:\n1. **Repetitive Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`:**\n   - PowerShell processes repeatedly check for the existence of `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` across multiple directories (e.g., `C:\\unidade_temporario\\registro_temporario\\elemento_secundario\\src\\`, `C:\\users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, etc.). \n   - This suggests **active probing** for a keystroke logging module, which is commonly associated with **malware** or **data exfiltration attempts**.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Folder:**\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This is a **common tactic** to evade detection by removing traces of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Unusual Image Loads:**\n   - PowerShell loads `.dll` files like `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, and `clr.dll`, which are part of the .NET runtime. While legitimate, their frequent loading in conjunction with the above patterns could indicate **script obfuscation** or **payload execution**.\n\n4. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Multiple `ProcessAccess` and `ImageLoad` events suggest **active monitoring or manipulation** of system processes, which is often seen in **persistent malware** or **privilege escalation attempts**.\n\n### Contextual Red Flags:\n- The repeated checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` (a known keystroke logger) imply **data collection intent**.\n- The use of PowerShell for file operations and script execution aligns with **post-exploitation activities** (e.g., lateral movement, persistence).\n\n### Confidence Level:\n- **High** (8\/10): The combination of suspicious file probing, temporary script deletion, and .NET-related image loads strongly suggests **malicious behavior**. However, further analysis (e.g., checking the script content, network traffic, user context) is needed to confirm intent.\n\n### Recommendation:\nInvestigate the `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` file paths, audit PowerShell logs for script execution details, and monitor network traffic for exfiltration attempts."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, there's a powershell.exe process with a task called \"Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\". Then there are two instances of powershell.exe running commands that check if a certain file exists, exiting 0 or 1 based on that. The paths mentioned are \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\\\" and \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\\". These paths look a bit odd. They don't seem like standard Windows directories. Maybe they're trying to access files in non-standard locations, which could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if it's part of a log setup, but I should note it. Then several entries about powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Multiple \"Process accessed\" events might indicate that something is probing the system, trying to interact with other processes or modify registry settings. That's not typical for normal operations.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe execution, which is common for checking user context, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger operation. The notepad.exe and calc.exe entries are normal, but the image load events for urlmon.dll are standard too. However, the repetition of \"Process accessed\" by powershell.exe multiple times might indicate persistent activity or probing.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entries, there are multiple network connections and DNS queries. That's normal for browsing, but if there's a lot of DNS queries to suspicious domains, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't mention the specific domains, so I can't say for sure. The svchost.exe entries with registry changes might be part of legitimate system processes, but again, the frequency could be a concern.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious parts are the non-standard paths checked by PowerShell, the multiple process accesses, and the repeated registry modifications. The presence of these events could indicate an attacker checking for the existence of malicious scripts, accessing processes to gather information, or modifying the registry to persist. However, without more context like the actual content of the files or network destinations, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events does raise some flags. So I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for existence of suspicious files in non-standard paths (e.g., C:\\\\tarefa_temporario\\\\, C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\), combined with repeated 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events, which may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. One of the entries has a command line with \"ls -recurse\", \"get-childitem -recurse\", and \"gci -recurse\". Those are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. That could be part of a script that's searching for files, maybe looking for something specific. But is that suspicious on its own? Maybe not, unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen, there are several \"Image loaded\" events for files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. Those are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily bad. However, there's also an entry for \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's part of the antivirus, so that's normal too.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest... That might be part of a script that's testing execution policies or something similar. But creating and deleting a temp file could be part of normal operations or could be an attempt to hide activities. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events. Those might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but if they're occurring multiple times, maybe there's some unusual activity. However, I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe first event is 'whoami.exe', which is a legitimate command to display user information. That's normal.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there are a few \"Registry value set\" entries. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate configuration changes, but it can also be used by malware to persist or modify system settings. However, without knowing what specific values were changed, it's hard to assess.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes creating and accessing files, along with image loads, might indicate that someone is running scripts or trying to execute commands. But again, it could be part of normal user activity, like a script that's being run for legitimate purposes.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies. For example, if there are unexpected processes or unusual network activity, but in these logs, the main activity is around PowerShell and file operations. There's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is a log shipper. That might be part of normal logging setup.\n\nPutting it all together, while there's a lot of PowerShell activity, none of the individual events seem overtly malicious. However, the repeated use of PowerShell for recursive file listing and the creation\/deletion of a temp script might be worth investigating further. It could be a red flag if this is part of a larger pattern of suspicious behavior, but based solely on these logs, it's not conclusive. The confidence level is probably moderate—there's enough to warrant further examination but not enough to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Repetitive use of `ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, and `gci -recurse`** in command lines suggests recursive file enumeration. While common in legitimate scripts, this could also be part of **malicious reconnaissance** (e.g., searching for sensitive files, credentials, or exploit targets).\n   - **Multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events** may indicate PowerShell being used for scripting or automation, but the repetition could hint at **unusual or automated behavior**.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is **created and deleted** in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. This is a **common tactic for malware** to execute payloads in memory (e.g., \"living off the land\") and avoid leaving persistent traces. However, it could also be part of **legitimate testing** (e.g., script execution policy checks).\n\n3. **Image Loads**:\n   - Legitimate system files (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) are loaded, which is normal for .NET operations. However, the **Windows Defender component `MpOAV.dll`** being loaded might indicate **antivirus interaction**, which could be benign or part of **malware evasion**.\n\n4. **Registry Changes**:\n   - Multiple **\"Registry value set\"** events are logged. While registry modifications are common, they could be used for **persistence** (e.g., adding startup entries) or **configuration changes**. No specific keys\/values are mentioned, so context is needed.\n\n5. **Winlogbeat Activity**:\n   - A file (`winlogbeat-8.15.1...`) is created, which is a **log shipper tool**. This is likely **legitimate** if part of a monitoring setup, but could also be **exploited** if the tool is misconfigured or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n- **Suspicious File Behavior**: Creation\/deletion of a temporary script in `Temp` (could be part of a **malicious payload execution**).\n- **PowerShell Automation**: Repeated use of `get-childitem -recurse` may indicate **data exfiltration** or **file discovery**.\n- **Lack of Context**: No clear correlation between events (e.g., no network activity, user accounts, or error logs) makes it harder to confirm malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Correlate with Other Data**:\n   - Check for **network traffic** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains).\n   - Review **user accounts** and **permissions** associated with the activity.\n   - Look for **anomalous login times** or **unusual user behavior**.\n\n2. **Inspect the Deleted Script**:\n   - If the temp file was deleted, use **file recovery tools** or **forensic analysis** to check its contents.\n   - Check **Windows Event Logs** for **script execution policies** or **PowerShell transcript logs**.\n\n3. **Monitor Windows Defender Logs**:\n   - Investigate if `MpOAV.dll` or other Defender components were involved in **malware detection** or **false positives**.\n\n4. **Check for PowerShell Misuse**:\n   - Use **PowerShell logging** (e.g., `Set-PSDebug -Trace 1`) or **SIEM alerts** for **unusual script execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile **no definitive malicious activity is confirmed**, the combination of **PowerShell enumeration**, **temporary script creation\/deletion**, and **registry changes** raises **moderate suspicion**. Further investigation is needed to rule out **malicious intent** or **benign misconfiguration**. Confidence level: **50%** (moderate)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. So, looking at the first event: powershell.exe created a file called estrutura_secundario.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a normal user activity, maybe someone saving a file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThe second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's common for it to create configuration files. This seems legitimate, part of its normal operation.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. However, if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be a red flag. But alone, not too suspicious.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe accessing a process. Again, PowerShell can access processes for legitimate reasons, like troubleshooting. But if combined with other events, maybe something's up.\n\nNow, looking at all together. There are multiple PowerShell events. The first is creating a file, which is normal. The third and fourth are registry and process access. But none of these events show clear signs of malicious activity. No unusual file paths, no known malicious files mentioned. The winlogbeat event is normal. The user might be doing some administrative tasks, but without more context or signs of compromise (like unexpected network activity, unusual command lines, or access to sensitive files), it's hard to flag this as interesting. \n\nConfidence is low here. Maybe around 0.3. The justification is that while there are multiple PowerShell events, they don't show clear signs of malicious behavior.
