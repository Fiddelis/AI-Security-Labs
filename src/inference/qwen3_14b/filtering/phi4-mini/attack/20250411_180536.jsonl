{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? Maybe not suspicious on its own. But then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are often used for administrative tasks but can also be exploited for malicious activities. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe create and start commands. SC.exe is used to manage Windows services. The command line here is creating a service called \"elemento_principal\" pointing to an executable path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\elemento_geral\\\\componente_comum\\\\modulo_geral\\\\bin\\\\unidade_base.exe\". The path has a lot of underscores and seems generic, which might be a red flag. Also, another sc.exe command is starting \"elemento_auxiliar\". Creating and starting services without user interaction could be part of a malware installation.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events from processes like services.exe, cmd.exe, and others. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware. The fact that services.exe is involved in registry changes might indicate that the malware is modifying system settings to maintain access.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new configuration file might be normal. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, it could be something else. But I don't see other events that would link this to malicious activity directly.\n\nAnother point is the presence of multiple powershell.exe instances with ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands and modifying the system. The combination of ProcessAccess and Registry changes could indicate that an attacker is trying to maintain control or install persistence.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence like file downloads from malicious URLs, unexpected network connections to suspicious IPs, or execution of known malicious files. The events are more about process creation and registry changes, which can be both benign and malicious. But the use of sc.exe to create services and the unusual file paths might be indicators of something malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch shows some suspicious activities that could be part of an attack, like creating services and modifying the registry. But without more context or additional indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence might be around 0.65, as there are some red flags but not conclusive proof.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of services via sc.exe with non-standard paths, frequent registry modifications by cmd.exe\/powershell.exe, and unusual process interactions. These patterns may indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entries, there are multiple Chrome.exe processes doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's PowerShell.exe being accessed and some registry events. PowerShell is common, but when combined with other activities, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes 'sc.exe create' and 'sc.exe start'. The 'sc.exe' command is used to create and manage Windows services. The command line here is creating a service named 'elemento_principal' pointing to a path that looks suspicious: 'C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe'. The path has a lot of underscores and seems obfuscated, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nAnother entry shows 'sc.exe' creating another service named 'tarefa_principal' pointing to another odd path: 'C:\\pacote_auxiliar\\registro_base\\modulo_ativo\\bin\\unidade_geral.exe'. Again, the naming and paths are suspicious. Then there's a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but creating a new config file might be normal unless it's part of an attack.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events from various processes, which could indicate attempts to modify system settings or inject code. The presence of 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs might be normal, but combined with the service creation, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe later entries include Notepad.exe and Calc.exe with registry changes. While Notepad and Calculator are standard apps, their use here with registry modifications might be part of a broader pattern. However, the earlier service creation and obfuscated paths are more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the use of 'sc.exe' to create services with unusual paths, multiple registry modifications by various processes, and the presence of PowerShell and cmd.exe commands that could be part of an attack chain. These signs suggest potential malicious activity, so the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Service Creation via `sc.exe`**\n- **Command Example**:\n  ```bash\n  sc.exe create elemento_principal binPath= \"C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe\"\n  ```\n  - **Risk**: The use of `sc.exe` to create a Windows service with a **non-standard path** (`C:\\elemento_geral\\...`) is highly suspicious. Malware often uses obfuscated or non-standard paths to evade detection.\n  - **Indicators**:\n    - The service name (`elemento_principal`) and path contain non-English characters and obfuscation, which is common in malicious payloads.\n    - The file `unidade_base.exe` is not a standard Windows component.\n\n- **Second Service**:\n  ```bash\n  sc.exe create tarefa_principal binPath= \"C:\\pacote_auxiliar\\registro_base\\modulo_ativo\\bin\\unidade_geral.exe\"\n  ```\n  - Similar obfuscation in the path (`modulo_ativo`, `pacote_auxiliar`) and service name (`tarefa_principal`) raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell and `cmd.exe` Usage for Malicious Activities**\n- **PowerShell Activity**:\n  - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` being accessed or triggering registry modifications. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in conjunction with suspicious file paths or commands (e.g., `sc.exe`) could indicate **script-based attacks** or **payload execution**.\n  \n- **`cmd.exe` Activity**:\n  - The `cmd.exe` process is used to execute `sc.exe` commands to create services. This is a common technique for **persistence mechanisms** in malware.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Registry Modifications**\n- **Multiple Processes** (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, etc.) trigger **`Registry value set`** events.\n  - **Risk**: Unauthorized registry changes can indicate **malware persistence**, **DLL hijacking**, or **system configuration tampering**.\n  - **Context**: The combination of registry modifications with service creation and obfuscated file paths suggests a **multi-stage attack**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Suspicious File Creation**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creates a file:\n  ```bash\n  C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new\n  ```\n  - **Risk**: While `winlogbeat` is a legitimate log shipper, the creation of a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory could indicate **tampering with configuration files** or **malicious data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Obfuscated File Paths and Names**\n- **Examples**:\n  - `C:\\elemento_geral\\componente_comum\\modulo_geral\\bin\\unidade_base.exe`\n  - `C:\\pacote_auxiliar\\registro_base\\modulo_ativo\\bin\\unidade_geral.exe`\n  - **Risk**: These paths use **non-standard naming conventions** and **obfuscation** (e.g., `modulo`, `pacote`, `elemento`) to avoid detection. This is a common tactic in **malware** and **APT attacks**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Legitimate Processes with Suspicious Behavior**\n- **`notepad.exe`**, **`calc.exe`**, and **`svchost.exe`** are involved in **registry modifications**.\n  - **Risk**: Legitimate processes being used for malicious activities (e.g., **DLL injection**, **process hollowing**) could indicate **malware evasion** techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malicious activity**, including:\n- **Persistence mechanisms** (service creation via `sc.exe`).\n- **Registry tampering** for persistence or configuration changes.\n- **Obfuscated file paths** and names, indicative of malware.\n- **Use of legitimate tools** (`PowerShell`, `cmd.exe`, `winlogbeat`) for suspicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Investigate the files** (`unidade_base.exe`, `unidade_geral.exe`) for malware signatures.\n2. **Monitor the services** created by `sc.exe` for anomalous behavior.\n3. **Analyze registry changes** for unauthorized modifications.\n4. **Check the `.yml.new` file** for tampering or data exfiltration.\n5. **Perform a full system scan** using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.\n6. **Review user activity** around the time of these events (e.g., `fiddelis` user).\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict**: **High risk of compromise**. Immediate investigation is required."}
