The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of PowerShell commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and running at logon could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. \n\nThe task names are things like \"unidade_ativo$object\" and \"tarefa_base$object\"—maybe random or obfuscated names to avoid detection. The repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests a pattern, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, there are events related to image loading, like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. While those are legitimate files, the context here is PowerShell scripts creating scheduled tasks, which might indicate malicious activity. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory could be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in malware.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign explanations. Maybe this is a legitimate script that's testing scheduled tasks, but the use of administrators group and the repetition of the same command across multiple events makes me think it's more likely malicious. The confidence here would be around 0.85 because the pattern and the use of admin rights are strong indicators, but without more context, it's not 100% certain. Still, it's definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potentially malicious activity** warranting investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Repetitive Scheduled Task Creation via PowerShell:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the executable (common in malicious payloads for testing persistence).\n     - **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the user context (escalated privileges).\n     - **`RunLevel Highest`** (exploiting elevated permissions).\n     - Obfuscated task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo$object`, `tarefa_geral$object`), suggesting evasion of detection.\n\n2. **Persistence Mechanism:**\n   - Scheduled tasks triggered **at user logon** (common in malware for persistence).\n   - The repetition of the same command across multiple events implies **automation or scripted exploitation**.\n\n3. **File Artifacts:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created and deleted in the **`Temp` directory**, a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence.\n   - Loading of **`MpOAV.dll`** (Windows Defender component) might indicate an attempt to bypass security software (though this alone is not conclusive).\n\n4. **Lateral Movement\/Privilege Escalation:**\n   - Use of **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** suggests the attacker may have gained administrative access, which is a high-risk scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation:**\n- The **pattern of scheduled task creation** with elevated privileges is highly suspicious and aligns with **malware persistence techniques**.\n- The **creation\/deletion of temporary files** and obfuscation of task names suggest **malicious intent to evade detection**.\n- The **presence of PowerShell** (often abused for scripting attacks) combined with **Windows Defender components** could indicate **anti-analysis behavior** or **exploitation of security tools**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Check for unauthorized scheduled tasks** on the system (e.g., via `schtasks \/query`).\n- **Analyze the deleted script** (if possible via forensics tools) to determine its purpose.\n- **Monitor for lateral movement** (e.g., network traffic, access to other systems).\n- **Investigate the source of administrative privileges** (e.g., credential theft, misconfigured permissions).\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **High (85-90%)** – The combination of persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious activity. However, further context (e.g., user intent, system baseline) could alter this assessment."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first entry has a process with a command line that's using PowerShell to create a scheduled task. The command line is creating a task that runs calc.exe, which is a bit suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate Windows app, but when combined with scheduled tasks, especially with high privileges, it might be a sign of something malicious. The task is set to trigger at logon and runs as administrators with highest privileges. That seems like a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes. But those could be normal, unless there's a pattern. However, the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks are concerning. There are 19 of those entries, which might indicate someone trying to execute commands remotely, possibly part of an attack.\n\nAnother event mentions the creation of a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum,\" which might be a scheduled task. Also, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's Downloads folder, which could be part of data exfiltration or setup.\n\nLooking at the file paths, the taskschd.dll is involved, which is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's normal. However, the combination of creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges and multiple remote command executions seems like a possible attack. The presence of both legitimate processes (like chrome, svchost) and suspicious activities (scheduled tasks with calc, remote commands) might indicate a mix of normal and malicious activities.\n\nBut wait, why would someone create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe? That's unusual. Typically, attackers might use scheduled tasks to run malicious payloads. Also, the repeated remote command executions could be part of a broader attack, like a remote access tool. \n\nHowever, there's also the possibility of false positives. For example, the registry changes might be from legitimate software updates. But the high number of remote command executions and the scheduled task creation with high privileges are more indicative of a potential security threat. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch has a mix of normal and suspicious activities. The key points are the scheduled task with admin rights, multiple remote commands, and file creation in suspicious locations. These could be signs of an attack, so it's worth investigating further. Therefore, the answer is yes, this is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of **legitimate system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown of key indicators:\n\n### **1. Suspicious Scheduled Task Creation**\n- **Event**: PowerShell script creating a scheduled task (`unidade_comum`) with **admin privileges** and **triggered at logon**.\n  - **Command**: `calc.exe` (a benign utility, but its use in a scheduled task with elevated privileges is unusual and may mask malicious payloads).\n  - **Implication**: Could be an attempt to execute arbitrary code under elevated privileges or evade detection.\n\n### **2. Repeated \"Remote Command Execution\" Events**\n- **19 instances** of `Execute a Remote Command` logged, potentially indicating:\n  - **Remote access attempts** (e.g., via PowerShell remoting, RDP, or exploit tools).\n  - **Command-and-control (C2) traffic** from an attacker.\n  - **Implication**: High volume of remote commands may signal a **post-exploitation phase** or **persistent access**.\n\n### **3. Unusual File Activity**\n- **File creation** in system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum`) and user downloads (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_principal.txt`).\n  - **Implication**: May indicate **data exfiltration**, **malware installation**, or **log file generation** by an attacker.\n\n### **4. Process and Module Load Anomalies**\n- **`WmiPrvSE.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`**: Normal (Task Scheduler), but could be exploited in attacks.\n- **`chrome.exe` loading `amsi.dll`**: Amsi (Antimalware Scan Interface) is a legitimate component, but its interaction with Chrome could signal **tampering** or **bypassing security checks**.\n\n### **5. PowerShell Activity**\n- **File creation** and **registry modifications** via PowerShell, which is often used in **script-based attacks** (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**Yes, this log set is highly suspicious and warrants investigation**. Key red flags include:\n- **Elevated privilege task creation** with `calc.exe`.\n- **Frequent remote command executions** (potential C2 activity).\n- **Unusual file creation** in sensitive directories.\n- **PowerShell-based operations** that could enable persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Correlate timestamps and IPs involved in remote commands.\n- Analyze the contents of `entrada_principal.txt` and other created files.\n- Check for signs of **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement** via PowerShell.\n- Monitor for **unauthorized access** to system directories or user data."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing an event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a common activity, but maybe if it's happening a lot, it could be suspicious. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for various reasons, like updates or extensions. But there are six instances of this exact same event. That repetition might be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign activity, but repeated registry changes could indicate something like a persistence mechanism or malware trying to modify settings.\n\nThen there's one entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in its data directory seems normal. The path mentions a .yml.new file, which could be part of a configuration update. Not suspicious here.\n\nAnother entry is 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but creating a file isn't inherently bad. However, the name 'objeto_auxiliar' translates to 'auxiliary object' in Spanish. That's a bit vague, but maybe it's just a temporary file. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but alone, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, combining all these: multiple registry changes by Chrome, which could be normal, but the repetition might be worth checking. The other events don't show obvious signs of compromise. However, the lack of other suspicious activities like unexpected network connections, privilege escalations, or unusual process behaviors makes me think this might not be a high priority. \n\nBut wait, maybe the repeated registry events are part of a larger attack. For example, if an attacker is using Chrome to modify registry keys for persistence. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to say. The justification here is that while there are multiple registry changes, they're all from Chrome and no other suspicious activities are present. The confidence is moderate because it's not conclusive, but there's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modification events by chrome.exe (6 instances) could indicate potential malicious behavior, though benign activity cannot be ruled out. Additional events include file creation by winlogbeat.exe (normal log shipping activity) and powershell.exe creating a file with a non-descriptive name, which may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
