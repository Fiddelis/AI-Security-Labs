{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell.exe executing commands that create scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, triggering at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high run level. The task names vary a bit, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. Hmm, creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and running calc.exe on logon. That seems suspicious because calc.exe is a legitimate tool but using it in this context might be part of a malicious payload. Also, the fact that multiple tasks are being registered with different names but same structure could indicate an attempt to evade detection by varying the task names.\n\nThen there are other events with PowerShell.exe related to registry value sets and process access. But the more concerning ones are the scheduled task creations. Also, looking at the image loaded events, there's mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. The presence of MpOAV.dll might be normal, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's worth checking if there's any unusual behavior.\n\nWait, the command_line in the first events uses Register-ScheduledTask with the task name and the $object. Since calc.exe is a benign process, but if this is part of a larger attack, maybe the actual payload is hidden. However, the logs don't show any other malicious files being accessed. The file created event is a temporary PowerShell script, which could be part of normal operations, but when combined with the scheduled tasks, it's a red flag.\n\nThe classification should be INTERESTING because multiple scheduled tasks are being created with admin privileges, which is a common technique in attacks to maintain persistence. Even though calc.exe is harmless, the method of deployment here is suspicious. The combination of PowerShell, scheduled tasks, and loading .NET assemblies might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or payloads that aren't immediately obvious from the logs provided. However, without seeing the actual content of the scripts or more malicious activities, it's a bit of a judgment call. But the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights is enough to flag this as potentially malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n1. **Multiple Scheduled Task Creations with Administrative Privileges**:\n   - PowerShell scripts repeatedly create scheduled tasks (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`, `tarefa_geral`) configured to run `calc.exe` at logon with **`RunLevel: Highest`** and **`Principal: BUILTIN\\Administrators`**. \n   - While `calc.exe` is a legitimate utility, the **repeated creation of tasks with elevated privileges** and **obfuscated command-line arguments** (e.g., escaped quotes, nested variables) suggests an attempt to **evade detection** or **execute hidden payloads**.\n\n2. **Unusual File and Module Loadings**:\n   - PowerShell loads `.NET` assemblies (`mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) and **Windows Defender components** (`MpOAV.dll`). While these are legitimate, their presence in conjunction with the scheduled tasks raises questions about **potential script execution or tampering** with security tools.\n\n3. **Temporary Script Creation**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created in the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory. This could indicate **script-based attacks** or **policy testing** (e.g., bypassing execution restrictions).\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Benign Context**:\n   - The logs do not show evidence of legitimate administrative tasks or user-initiated actions that justify the elevated privileges and task creation. This **lack of context** warrants further analysis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **repeated use of PowerShell to create privileged scheduled tasks** with obfuscated commands, combined with **unusual module loadings and temporary script creation**, constitutes a **high-risk indicator of compromise (IoC)**. This warrants immediate investigation to rule out **persistence mechanisms**, **script-based attacks**, or **malware execution**. \n\n**Recommendation**: Correlate these events with endpoint logs, check the contents of the temporary script, and inspect the scheduled tasks for hidden payloads or malicious behavior."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is involved in a File Delete event, deleting a script file in the Temp directory. That's not uncommon, but maybe part of normal operations. Then there's a Pipe Created event, but no file involved. \n\nThe third event is a command line from powershell.exe that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, set to run at logon for Administrators with high privileges. That's a red flag. Creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be an attempt to escalate privileges or persist access. The command line uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are typical in malicious activities for persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. That might be normal, but if it's happening repeatedly, it could indicate some kind of modification or tracking. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother event shows the loading of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which is legitimate, so that's probably okay. Then there's a bunch of \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with no process name. That's concerning because it could indicate unauthorized remote execution attempts. If these are coming from unknown sources, that's a security issue.\n\nThe last few entries include svchost.exe creating a file in the Tasks directory, which might be related to the scheduled tasks mentioned earlier. Also, the powershell.exe creating a file in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive could be part of setting up persistent access.\n\nPutting it all together: the scheduled task creation with high privileges, multiple remote command executions, and the use of PowerShell for these actions are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination suggests a possible security incident that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest), repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no process context, and file operations in sensitive locations (e.g., Temp directory, System32\\\\Tasks). These patterns suggest potential privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or remote code execution attempts.\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them involve 'chrome.exe' and 'conhost.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set' and 'Image loaded'. The 'Image loaded' events have file paths like 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll, that might be normal, but sometimes attackers might try to replace or manipulate these DLLs. However, the paths here are the standard ones, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal. But there's also 'powershell.exe' creating text files. Creating files isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious files or executing scripts, that could be a problem. However, in the given logs, the files created are just text files named things like 'entrada_principal.txt' and 'objeto_auxiliar.txt', which don't immediately look suspicious.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe doing registry value sets. While registry changes can be part of normal operations, excessive changes might indicate something like a registry-based persistence mechanism. But without more context, like specific keys being modified or unusual values, it's hard to tell. The repetition of 'Registry value set' by chrome.exe could be worth noting, but maybe it's part of legitimate behavior, such as extensions or updates.\n\nAnother point is that the 'Image loaded' events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are from chrome.exe. Since these are legitimate system files, unless there's a mismatch in hashes or digital signatures, it's probably okay. However, if the process is not supposed to load these DLLs, that might be an issue. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files might be part of a normal setup where it's initializing its configuration. The 'powershell.exe' creating files could be part of user activity, like saving logs or data. However, if there's a pattern of creating files in unusual locations or with suspicious names, that's a red flag. Here, the names are generic, and the paths are in the Downloads folder, which is common for user files.\n\nPutting it all together, the logs don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly related to normal operations, even if some might be a bit frequent. There's no obvious indication of malware, unauthorized access, or suspicious file modifications. The justification would be that while there are some registry changes and file creations, they don't point to a clear security threat based on the information provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system behavior with no clear indicators of compromise. Registry modifications by chrome.exe and image loads of legitimate system DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) are consistent with normal operations. File creation events involve benign text files and legitimate processes (winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) in user directories, without evidence of malicious activity.\"\n}"}
