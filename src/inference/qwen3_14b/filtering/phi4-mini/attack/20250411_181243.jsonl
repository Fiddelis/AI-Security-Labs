{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain commands, it can be suspicious. Let me check the command lines. One entry has a powershell command that runs several commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users', 'get-childitem', 'dir', 'get-localgroup', and 'net localgroup'. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system, users, and groups. That's a red flag because it looks like the attacker is enumerating the system, which is a common step in a cyber attack.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events for powershell.exe. Accessing processes and modifying registry values can indicate attempts to maintain persistence or alter system settings. Also, the 'Image loaded' events point to loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. While these are legitimate .NET components, their loading in the context of multiple powershell.exe instances might be part of a larger malicious payload or a dropper.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File Delete logged' event where a temporary PowerShell script is deleted. Deleting temporary files is normal, but if the script was malicious and the attacker is trying to clean up traces, that's a concern. The presence of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to the PowerShell execution policy or some logging mechanism, but repeated entries could indicate automated scripts or malware.\n\nThere's also a 'net1.exe' process, which seems like a typo or a renamed 'net.exe'. The command line is 'net1 user', which might be an attempt to use a similar tool to 'net.exe' for user enumeration, but the name 'net1.exe' is unusual and could be a malicious replacement.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' event shows a file creation in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but if it's being used in an unexpected way or if the file path seems out of place, it could be suspicious. However, this single event might not be enough to flag it unless combined with other malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands gathering system information, the registry modifications, loading of .NET components, and the presence of a suspicious 'net1.exe' process all point towards potential malicious activity. The deletion of a temporary script might be an attempt to cover tracks. While some events are normal, the combination and frequency here suggest a possible security incident that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **PowerShell Enumeration Commands**:\n   - A `powershell.exe` process executed a script with commands like `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, and `ls C:\/Users`. These commands are **typical of system enumeration** during an attack (e.g., identifying users, groups, and credentials).\n\n2. **Unusual Process Names**:\n   - A process named `net1.exe` (instead of the legitimate `net.exe`) ran the command `net1 user`. This **suspiciously deviates from standard tools** and could indicate a **malicious replacement or obfuscation**.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple `Process accessed` and `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe` suggest **attempts to modify system settings or maintain persistence**.\n\n4. **Loading of .NET DLLs**:\n   - `Image loaded` events for `.NET` components (`mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`) in the context of multiple `powershell.exe` instances could indicate **malware leveraging .NET for execution or payload delivery**.\n\n5. **File Deletion of Temporary Script**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`...\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) was deleted after creation. While deletion is normal, this **may signal cleanup of malicious artifacts**.\n\n6. **Winlogbeat File Creation**:\n   - A `winlogbeat.exe`-related file was created in a user's `Downloads` directory. While **Winlogbeat is legitimate**, its presence here could be **misconfigured or part of a data exfiltration attempt** if paired with other suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe logs show **behavior consistent with a post-exploitation phase** (e.g., lateral movement, data collection, persistence). The combination of PowerShell enumeration, suspicious process names, and file manipulation **strongly suggests a potential security incident**. Further analysis (e.g., checking for additional malicious files, network traffic, or user behavior) is recommended. \n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the `net1.exe` process, examine the deleted PowerShell script for remnants, and review Winlogbeat configurations for anomalies."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first one is a PowerShell command that's doing a bunch of things: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups, which could be part of reconnaissance. The presence of cmdkey \/list might be checking stored credentials. That's suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of PowerShell processes being created and accessed. The file created events include a text file in the Downloads folder and another in AppData. Creating files in user directories isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other activities, it might be part of something. Also, there's a winlogbeat file being created, which is a log shipper. Maybe someone is trying to set up data exfiltration?\n\nThere are several registry value set events involving PowerShell, conhost, RuntimeBroker, and svchost. Changing registry values can be a sign of malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms. The image load events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exeâ€”urlmon.dll is used for web browsing, but if it's being loaded by calculator, that might be unusual. Maybe a dropper or something malicious is using that.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the first PowerShell command is a series of commands that could be used to gather system info. The presence of 'get-localuser' and 'get-localgroupmember' suggests the attacker is mapping out user accounts and groups. The 'cmdkey \/list' checks for stored credentials, which could be part of credential harvesting.\n\nThe multiple PowerShell processes accessing and creating files might indicate that the attacker is trying to establish persistence or create backdoors. The registry changes could be part of that. The winlogbeat file being created might be an attempt to configure log shipping to exfiltrate data.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be benign. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating files in Downloads is normal. But when combined with other suspicious activities like registry changes and credential checks, it's more likely malicious.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern. The repeated use of PowerShell for system enumeration, creating files, and modifying the registry points to a potential attack. The presence of multiple registry events and file creations in user directories could be part of an attack chain. The image load events might be red herrings, but they could also indicate malicious code execution.\n\nConfidence-wise, since there are multiple suspicious activities that could be part of an attack, but not definitive proof, I'd say around 0.75. It's not 100% certain, but enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing system enumeration commands (user\/group checks, credential listing), file creation in user directories, registry modifications, and unusual image loads (urlmon.dll in calculator processes). These patterns suggest potential reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
