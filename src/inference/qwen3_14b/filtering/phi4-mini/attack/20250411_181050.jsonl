{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but if it's being used in an unexpected context, that could be a red flag. However, the command line here seems straightforward.\n\nNext, powershell.exe and cmd.exe are both common, but the command line for one of the cmd.exe entries stands out. It uses certutil to encode and decode files, which is often used for base64 encoding, but in the context of malware, this can be a method to execute malicious code. The command line includes encoding calc.exe into a temporary file and then decoding it back, which might be a way to obfuscate the execution. That seems suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of certutil.exe being used with encode and decode commands. The paths involved, like %temp% directories, are common places for malware to store temporary files. Also, the decoded executable is saved in the temp folder, which could be part of a payload delivery mechanism.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a DLL from PcaSvc.dll. That might be related to some legitimate Windows processes, but the specific task name 'PcaPatchSdbTask' isn't familiar to me. It might be worth checking if that's a known legitimate component or if it's being abused here.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll from System32 seems normal, but if those DLLs are being loaded from unexpected locations or if there's any indication of tampering, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the system configuration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The chrome.exe events involving network connections might be normal browsing, but if there's a high volume or unusual destinations, that could be a concern. However, the logs don't specify the network destinations, so I can't be sure.\n\nPutting this all together, the key suspicious elements are the use of certutil for encoding\/decoding files, which is often associated with malware. The presence of multiple certutil processes, the use of temporary directories, and the command lines involving calc.exe (which is a common example in malware demonstrations) all point towards potential malicious activity. While some events might be benign, the combination of these factors increases the likelihood that this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files in temporary directories (common in malware), cmd.exe executing obfuscated commands, and frequent registry\/network activity from chrome.exe. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first batch, there's a cmd.exe process that uses certutil to encode and decode files. The command line shows encoding calc.exe into a temp file and then decoding another temp file into an executable. That seems fishy because certutil is often used for encoding\/decoding, which can be part of data exfiltration or malicious payload delivery. Also, there's a decoded file in the temp directory, which might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's multiple instances of certutil.exe being run with encode and decode commands. The paths mentioned are in the user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but when combined with encoding\/decoding, it could indicate something malicious. Also, the File Executable Detected event for estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe in the temp folder might be a sign of a malicious file being executed.\n\nThere's also a rundll32.exe process calling PcaSvc.dll with PcaPatchSdbTask. That doesn't ring a bell immediately, but sometimes rundll32 can be abused for malicious purposes. Also, SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dllâ€”those are legitimate system DLLs, but if they're being loaded by an unknown or suspicious process, that could be a problem. However, SDXHelper.exe might be part of some software, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a lot of chrome.exe events related to network connections and registry changes. Chrome making multiple network connections could be normal, but if it's connecting to suspicious IPs or domains, that's a problem. However, the logs don't show the destination, so maybe not enough info here. The registry changes might be part of Chrome's normal operation, but again, without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn the second batch, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal if it's part of setup. However, the presence of a new config file could be part of a configuration change, which might be benign or could be a sign of tampering. Then, powershell.exe doing registry changes and process access. PowerShell is often used by attackers for various malicious activities, so those events might be worth looking into. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the certutil usage, the decoded executable in temp, and the SDXHelper loading DLLs might be the most suspicious. However, the logs don't provide enough context to confirm malicious intent. It's possible that some of these are normal operations, but the combination of certutil and temp files, along with PowerShell and registry changes, could indicate a potential security incident. Therefore, I think these events are interesting enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n### **1. Suspicious Use of `certutil` for Encoding\/Decoding Files**\n- **Example:**  \n  ```bash\n  cmd.exe \/c certutil -encode C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\componente_auxiliar.txt\n  ```\n  - **Risk:** `certutil` is often misused for encoding\/decoding files, which can be part of **data exfiltration** or **malicious payload delivery** (e.g., hiding malware in encoded files). The use of `calc.exe` (a legitimate system tool) as input raises suspicion, as it could be a **trojanized binary**.\n\n- **Decoded Executable in Temp Directory:**  \n  - A decoded file (`estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe`) is created in the user's temporary directory. This could indicate **malware execution** or **payload extraction**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **`rundll32.exe` Invoking `PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask`:**\n  - **Risk:** While `rundll32` is a legitimate Windows tool, invoking `PcaPatchSdbTask` (a rare or obscure function) could indicate **exploitation of a vulnerability** or **abuse of system components** (e.g., patching tasks for malicious purposes).\n\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` Loading System DLLs:**\n  - **Example:**  \n    ```bash\n    Image loaded: C:\\Windows\\System32\\combase.dll, C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll\n    ```\n  - **Risk:** While these are legitimate system DLLs, their loading by `SDXHelper.exe` (a non-standard process name) could indicate **DLL hijacking** or **malware injection**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. PowerShell Activity and Registry Modifications**\n- **PowerShell Executing Commands:**\n  - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe` triggering **registry changes** (`Registry value set`) and **process access** (`Process accessed`).  \n  - **Risk:** PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for **post-exploitation tasks** (e.g., privilege escalation, persistence, or data exfiltration). Without context, these events are **highly suspicious**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Chrome.exe Network Activity**\n- **Multiple Network Connections:**\n  - Chrome.exe is detected making **repeated network connections**.  \n  - **Risk:** While Chrome's network activity is normal, **unusual patterns** (e.g., connections to unknown IPs\/domains, high volume, or encrypted traffic) could indicate **C2 communication** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Winlogbeat Configuration Changes**\n- **File Created:**  \n  ```bash\n  winlogbeat.exe created: C:\\Users\\fidelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.yml.new\n  ```\n  - **Risk:** Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but a **new configuration file** could indicate **tampering** or **reconfiguration for data exfiltration** (e.g., redirecting logs to an attacker-controlled endpoint).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate `certutil` and Temp Files:**  \n   - Analyze the contents of `componente_auxiliar.txt` and `estrutura_base_calc_decoded.exe` for malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Check for PowerShell Scripting Activity:**  \n   - Use tools like **PSLog** or **Sysmon** to inspect PowerShell command-line arguments and script content.\n\n3. **Monitor Network Traffic:**  \n   - Use **Wireshark** or **Zeek** to inspect Chrome.exe's network connections for C2 indicators (e.g., domain\/IP anomalies, encrypted traffic patterns).\n\n4. **Validate `SDXHelper.exe`:**  \n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate process (e.g., via reputation checks, file hashes). If not, investigate for **DLL hijacking** or **malware injection**.\n\n5. **Review Winlogbeat Configuration:**  \n   - Verify the `.yml.new` file's contents to ensure it is not redirecting logs to an unauthorized destination.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs contain **multiple red flags** (e.g., `certutil` misuse, PowerShell activity, and suspicious process behavior) that suggest **potential compromise** or **malicious activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to rule out threats such as **malware execution**, **C2 communication**, or **data exfiltration**."}
