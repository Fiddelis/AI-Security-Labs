Chrome making network connections is normal, but maybe if there's a lot of it, but here it's just a few entries. The real attention grabber is the powershell.exe events. \n\nLooking at the command_line in one of the processes, there's a PowerShell script that's doing some XOR encryption on a string that includes \"Path\" and \"C:\\\\Users\\\\victim\". Then it's sending that encrypted data to example.com via a POST request. That seems suspicious because XOR encryption is a simple method, often used in basic obfuscation. The fact that it's sending user path information to an external server could be data exfiltration.\n\nAlso, there are events about files being created and deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The image loaded events point to .NET DLLs, which might be part of the execution flow. The repeated Provider Lifecycle events might be related to the script's execution environment.\n\nEven though some events are normal, the combination of encrypted data exfiltration, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and the use of PowerShell for these activities raises a red flag.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that seem similar. They all have a command line that starts with 'powershell.exe & {' and then a block of code. The code is doing some encryption using XOR with a key, then sending the result to example.com via a POST request. That's a red flag because encrypting data and sending it to a remote server could be part of data exfiltration. The same command line is repeated several times, which might indicate a persistent or repeated activity.\n\nThen there are other events like 'Image loaded' for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's a lot of such events, it could be something. However, in this case, it's only one instance. The 'File created' event for winlogbeat.yml.new might be part of a log collector setup, which could be legitimate if it's part of monitoring, but if it's unexpected, it might be suspicious. However, the main issue here is the repeated PowerShell commands.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'Invoke-WebRequest' to send data to example.com. That's a common technique in PowerShell for exfiltrating data. The encryption with XOR is a simple method, which is often used in malicious scripts to avoid simple detection. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times across different events suggests that this might be part of a larger attack or a script that's being executed multiple times, perhaps to gather more data or to evade detection.\n\nOther events involve registry changes and process access, but those are more common in normal system operations. However, the combination of the PowerShell exfiltration attempts with these other events might indicate a broader malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the repeated exfiltration attempts are a strong indicator of something malicious happening.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch is interesting because of the multiple PowerShell commands that are encrypting data and sending it to a remote server, which is a common sign of data exfiltration.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The first event is about calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate system file. But then there are multiple entries for svchost.exe and other processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe with registry value sets. A lot of these are normal, but I need to check for anomalies.\n\nWait, there's a line where powershell.exe is executing a command to remove a file: \"Remove-Item \\\"C:\\\\objeto_temporario...\\\" -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\". That path looks suspicious with a lot of directories that might be obfuscated or part of a malicious payload. Also, the command is using -ErrorAction Ignore, which could be hiding errors, a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. But the file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't unusual, but the name is .yml.new, which might be part of a configuration change. However, the main red flag here is the powershell command trying to delete a file in a strange directory structure. This could indicate an attempt to clean up after an attack or to remove evidence.\n\nAlso, multiple registry value sets and process accesses might be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll might be normal, but if they're from unexpected locations, that's a problem. However, the paths here are legitimate system paths.\n\nSo, the key suspicious activity is the powershell command attempting to delete a file with that obfuscated path.

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries related to chrome.exe and registry value sets. But chrome.exe is a common process, and setting registry values isn't necessarily bad. However, the number of repeated entries might be a red flag. But I need to check other parts too.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process creating a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_hngxvv3x.rso.ps1. Then, almost immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a file quickly could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. The file path is in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the command_line field. These commands are trying to delete various .bat files across different directories, using -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. This seems like an attempt to remove files that might be part of an attack or to prevent detection. The paths mentioned are a bit generic, but the fact that PowerShell is being used to delete multiple files could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of sc.exe to stop and delete services. The command_line shows stopping a service called \"objeto_temporario\" and deleting \"estrutura_secundario\". Then there's another sc.exe command to delete \"objeto_principal\". Modifying or deleting services can be a way to hide malicious activities or remove components of an attack. This is definitely something to look into.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe execution, which is usually benign but could be part of reconnaissance to get user information. However, combined with other activities, it might be more concerning.\n\nThe presence of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender is normal, so that's probably not an issue. However, the other events involving PowerShell, file deletions, and service modifications are more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating and deleting temporary scripts, using PowerShell to remove multiple files, and modifying services suggests potential malicious activity.

There's a lot of activity from powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and whoami.exe. Now, whoami.exe is a legitimate tool used to display user information, and it's being called here, which is normal. But the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe might be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several Registry value set events and Process accessed events. Changing registry values can be part of normal operations, but if done in a way that's unusual or by non-system processes, it could be malicious. However, the processes here are like services.exe and conhost.exe, which are legitimate system processes. \n\nWait, but there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c del \/A:H %temp%\\\\tarefa_logico.txt >nul 2>&1\". This command is deleting a hidden file in the temp directory. Deleting hidden files might be part of cleanup, but the use of \/A:H could be an attempt to remove evidence. That's a bit suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and deleting files. For example, a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_14c001yd.l3m.ps1 and then immediately deleted. Creating and deleting temporary files is common, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a script that's trying to execute something without leaving traces.\n\nAnother point is the image loaded events. PowerShell loading mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's legitimate. But if there's any unusual behavior with those modules, it might be worth checking. However, just loading them isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThere's also the \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for powershell.exe. These might relate to the event logging provider, but repeated entries could indicate something's wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a mix of normal system processes and some potentially suspicious activities like deleting hidden files and creating\/deleting temporary scripts. However, none of the events alone are clearly malicious. The combination might be indicative of someone trying to perform actions and clean up, but without more evidence like network activity or unexpected registry changes, it's a bit inconclusive. \n\nBut since the user is asking for classification, and there are some suspicious commands and file operations, even if not definitively malicious, it might be considered interesting for further investigation.

That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate operations. But then there's a file created in the user's AppData folder, which could be benign or not. However, the next events show multiple registry value sets and process accesses by powershell.exe and conhost.exe. \n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process that's deleting a file in the Temp directory. The command line has \"del\" with some parameters, which might be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. \n\nLooking further, there are several instances of powershell.exe trying to remove a key.log file in the TEMP directory. The error action ignore suggests that they don't want any errors if the file isn't there, which could be part of cleaning up after some activity. \n\nAlso, there are multiple image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs. While those are legitimate, the frequency might be a red flag. The repeated process accesses and registry changes by powershell.exe and cmd.exe might indicate some level of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, I need to check if any of these are known good activities.

The file names are __PSScriptPolicyTest_... which might be related to PowerShell scripts. The fact that it's created and then deleted could be a red flag. Maybe someone is trying to execute a script and then clean up after themselves.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about the same command line being executed: Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log with ErrorAction Ignore. That's trying to delete a file, but if it's not there, it just ignores the error. Not sure if that's malicious yet, but repeated entries might indicate some automated process.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events for PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events could be part of a larger process. However, the paths are standard system files, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process created, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. Not suspicious on its own, but combined with other events?\n\nNow, checking for any patterns. The same Temp directory is used for file creation and deletion. The repeated FileCreate and FileDelete events for different files with similar names might indicate that someone is generating temporary scripts and then deleting them. This is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAlso, the Pipe Created events might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but when combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all these events are part of normal operations. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of creating and deleting files in Temp, along with multiple ImageLoads and registry changes, might be more indicative of something malicious.\n\nWait, there's also a Registry value set event. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms. If the registry is being modified without proper authorization, that's a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nAnother point: the same command line being executed multiple times. The Remove-Item command could be part of cleanup, but if it's part of a script that's being run repeatedly, that's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple PowerShell activities involving temporary files, registry changes, and image loading. While some of these could be normal, the pattern of creating and deleting files in the Temp directory, along with repeated commands, might indicate an attempt to execute scripts and then erase evidence. This is a common behavior in malware or malicious scripts. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation, as they align with behaviors commonly associated with malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell creating and then deleting temporary script files (e.g., `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`).  \n   - **Why this is concerning:** This is a classic evasion technique used by malware to execute scripts and delete evidence, minimizing forensic traces.\n\n2. **Repetitive Use of `Remove-Item` with `ErrorAction Ignore`:**\n   - The command `Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore` is logged repeatedly.  \n   - **Why this is concerning:** This suggests an attempt to delete files (possibly logs or artifacts) without causing script failures, which could indicate cleanup of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Frequent `ImageLoad` Events for PowerShell and Associated DLLs:**\n   - PowerShell loads several system DLLs (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`).  \n   - **Why this is concerning:** While some DLLs are legitimate (e.g., .NET runtime), the frequency and context (paired with file operations) could indicate anomalous behavior, such as memory injection or runtime manipulation.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - A `Registry value set` event is logged without details.  \n   - **Why this is concerning:** Unauthorized registry changes can be used for persistence or to alter system behavior, though further context is needed to confirm malicious intent.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation Events:**\n   - Multiple `Pipe Created` events are logged.  \n   - **Why this is concerning:** Pipes are often used for inter-process communication (IPC). While not inherently malicious, their presence alongside other suspicious activities raises flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations:**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases:** PowerShell is widely used for administrative tasks, and temporary file creation\/deletion can occur in benign scenarios (e.g., script execution, logging).  \n- **Lack of Context:** The logs do not include user identity, process parentage, or network activity, which are critical for determining intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Additional Data:**\n   - Check for **process tree** information (e.g., parent processes, command-line arguments) to determine if PowerShell is being invoked by unexpected sources (e.g., suspicious executables).\n   - Analyze **registry modifications** for changes to keys like `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` (persistence) or `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` (system-wide persistence).\n\n2. **Investigate Network Activity:**\n   - Look for **outbound connections** from the system, as malware often communicates with command-and-control servers.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in PowerShell Usage:**\n   - Use tools like **PowerShell transcript logging** or **ETW providers** to capture detailed script execution data.\n\n4. **File Integrity Checks:**\n   - Verify the integrity of files in the Temp directory and system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\assembly`) to detect tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs alone do not confirm malicious activity, the combination of **temporary file creation\/deletion**, **repetitive cleanup commands**, and **unusual process behavior** strongly suggests the need for further investigation. This could indicate a **malicious script execution** attempt, **data exfiltration**, or **persistence mechanism** setup. Immediate forensic analysis and correlation with additional telemetry are recommended. \n\n**Verdict:** 🚨 **Interesting for investigation** – further analysis is required to confirm malicious intent."}
