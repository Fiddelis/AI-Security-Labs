Calc.exe accessing URLs and loading images isn't suspicious on its own but might be part of a larger campaign targeting specific applications.\n\nConsidering all this together, the combination of unusual activities under powershell.exe, file mining attempts, and potential unauthorized monitoring points towards a potential security breach or malicious actors trying to access sensitive data.

Network detection could be a red flag if it's happening frequently or in unusual circumstances.

My job is to analyze whether this batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The key here is to look at the entire dataset and determine if there's any suspicious activity that might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one. I notice a lot of processes running: schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, WMIC.exe, and net.exe. These are all system-related processes, so nothing immediately jumps out as malicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog fields, most tasks under \"task\" seem to be related to image loading or registry activities. For example, several entries have \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" which might indicate unauthorized access to system files like urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. While image loading can sometimes be normal, especially for legitimate applications, the specific file paths here aren't standard, making them suspicious.\n\nThe \"file\" fields mostly point to null or internal system files, such as taskschd.dll and urlmon.dll. I remember that urlmon.exe is part of Windows Defender, which is a built-in security tool, so it's not unusual for it to load certain DLLs like urlmon.dll. Similarly, amsi.dll relates to Windows Components for集市, another system utility.\n\nThe cmd.exe processes have various command lines, some trying to delete specific files or running net user commands with admin privileges. These could be legitimate administrative tasks, but without more context, they're hard to classify as malicious on their own.\n\nI also notice that most of these processes don't modify the registry in ways that stand out. The \"Registry value set\" events are common actions when changing system settings, and the command lines used for deleting files or running user deletion commands could be part of normal maintenance activities rather than an attempt to access sensitive data.\n\nHowever, one thing that stands out is the high number of processes with elevated privileges, especially using admin accounts like \"componente_comum_Admin\" and \"tarefa_temporario_Admin.\" While this might indicate system administrators doing their jobs, it doesn't necessarily point towards malicious activity unless combined with other signs.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of certain processes. For instance, powershell.exe appears multiple times, which could be normal if an admin is using PowerShell for scripting tasks without any red flags.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some anomalies like unusual file paths and elevated privileges, they don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior on their own. Without additional context or a specific set of rules that define what's considered malicious, this batch doesn't meet the threshold to be classified as \"INTERESTING.\"\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The JSONL events primarily show normal system activities with some processes running elevated privileges.

Each line represents a process event with details like the process name, winlog task, and sometimes file information.\n\nFirst, I see several instances of 'cmd.exe' being used in different contexts, like deleting temp files and running system commands. There are multiple entries where 'powershell.exe' is accessed or its value set, which could indicate malicious activity if it's being used improperly.\n\nThe winlog tasks vary between Process Create, Process Access, and Registry value sets. These rules can be both benign and suspicious depending on the context. For example, creating a process via ProcessCreate is common but accessing it without proper permissions might raise a red flag.\n\nNoticing that 'cmd.exe' is involved in deleting specific files like 'temp%%\\\\unidade_temporario_calc.txt' and others suggests an attempt to clean up or potentially remove unwanted data. The presence of multiple similar commands could indicate a systematic effort, possibly for system optimization rather than malicious intent.\n\nHowever, the use of powershell.exe without context makes it harder to determine if it's being exploited maliciously. Without more details like elevated privileges or malicious commands executed through it, it's hard to classify definitively as suspicious.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are potential red flags like process creation and file deletion, the evidence isn't conclusive enough for an immediate investigation without further context.

There are multiple logs from different rules like ProcessAccess and FileDeleteDetected. The files involved include various PowerShell scripts and system components. This behavior is consistent across many events, which makes me think it's related to a malicious script running in the background.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes suggests automation or persistence. Automation can be used for legitimate tasks but might also hide malicious activities if not properly monitored. The fact that there are no clear indicators like malware being executed directly indicates this could be accidental or part of an undetected campaign.\n\nConsidering the rules triggered, such as ProcessCreate and FileDelete logged, it's possible these scripts are deleting files or creating directories without user knowledge. If a user has a backup schedule set up, this could mean data loss if they're not cautious. \n\nHowever, since all events pertain to 'powershell.exe', it's more likely related to system automation rather than direct malicious intent. Without evidence pointing directly to malware (like specific file hashes or behavior that looks like ransomware), the batch doesn't meet the criteria for an urgent investigation.\n\nSo, while there are concerning signs of automated activities, they don't immediately raise the level of urgency needed without more context or evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple logs from 'powershell.exe' processes across different rules.

Let me break down how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I looked at each event in the log. There are multiple entries, all of which are processes with their details. The first process is whoami.exe from C:\\Windows\\system32. It has a winlog entry under 'task' as Process Create. Then there's powershell.exe accessed through ProcessAccess.\n\nNext, I noticed several instances of chrome.exe. Each of these has winlog tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. Chrome.exe is known for being associated with online activity, especially if it's used to open web pages or make network requests.\n\nSince the log contains a significant number of chrome.exe processes with network connections detected, this could indicate malicious activity. Browsing history from a compromised account or unauthorized access attempts would be red flags. The consistent detection of network connections suggests potential malicious intent.\n\nI considered whether there might be non-malicious reasons for these logs appearing. For example, a legitimate browser used multiple times, but given the number and nature of the entries, it's more likely related to actual activity.\n\nThere are no obvious errors or unrelated processes in the log that would suggest something is off without further investigation. The presence of both Dns query and Network connection detected adds up to a concerning pattern for security monitoring.\n\nTherefore, putting all this together, I concluded that these logs are relevant for investigation due to potential malicious behavior indicated by chrome.exe's activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of processes with network connection detected and DNS queries related to Chrome.exe.
