The main thing here is that they're all powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and some other less common ones like svchost.exe, schtasks.exe, chrome.exe, etc. Now, I need to figure out if the combination of these logs makes this batch interesting.\n\nLooking at each event's winlog task: most are related to accessing processes or registry events. For instance, \"Process accessed\" and \"Registry value set.\" Some have command lines too, like cmd.exe running as a shortcut. \n\nThe key here is to see if any patterns stand out that could indicate malicious activity. I don't immediately notice anything unusual about these logs on their own—most are standard system operations. There's no evidence of unauthorized access beyond what's typical for legitimate tasks.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple instances of powershell.exe with various commands does raise a red flag. It might suggest some form of automation or script running as part of an attack, but without more context like timestamps, user sessions, or other indicators of compromise, it's hard to link these logs directly to malicious behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame—these events don't seem out of place for a typical day—they could very well be running in the background as normal system functions. There's nothing jumping out at me that points to something off. \n\nSo, putting it all together: while there are multiple attempts through different methods (like registry and process access), there's no direct evidence pointing towards malicious intent.

The classification can only be \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" with a brief justification.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each event to see what's going on. Most of the processes are powershell.exe, which makes sense because PowerShell is often used for system scripting and could indicate malicious activity if misused. The winlog tasks vary—File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, etc. But when I check the files, most are pointing to specific paths within user directories or in Program Files. \n\nLooking closer, some processes have command lines that seem like they're trying to run PowerShell scripts with conditions. For example, one has a command line like \"powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path ...) {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". These could be legitimate checks or attempts to automate certain tasks.\n\nI also notice there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with different winlog tasks but no files specified. This repetition suggests that this process is being used consistently, possibly in a controlled manner without malicious intent.\n\nThere's one instance where the file path points outside of typical user directories, which might be concerning. However, it's not immediately clear if this is from an attacker or just a regular setup.\n\nOverall, while there are indicators like repeated powershell.exe processes and varied winlog tasks, nothing stands out as suspicious without additional context.

This could be legitimate, perhaps for updating configurations or extensions.\n\n3. **Process with command line arguments**: One event shows a PowerShell command that calls itself and checks if certain files exist. The paths look like they might be malicious directories (like \"C:\\modulo_ativo\\\") but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the fact that it checks for specific files could indicate an attempt to create or delete files.\n\n4. **WindowsPowerShell.exe**: There are several instances with winlog tasks such as 'Engine Lifecycle'. This is a standard part of PowerShell scripts and doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\n5. **Files created and processed**: The files mentioned include system-related ones like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to Windows Defender and PowerShell.

The presence of a file called MpOAV.dll under Windows Defender might be related to malware detection, but I'm not certain without further analysis.\n\nLooking at the processes, the command lines often include paths pointing to specific directories, which could be legitimate script attempts or placeholders for real operations. However, some command lines are similar across different events, suggesting a pattern that's being exploited repeatedly.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command-line arguments that seem to check if certain files exist and then take action based on their presence. This kind of automation could be part of legitimate processes like backups or data transfers, but without knowing which specific files are relevant, it's hard to assess as malicious.\n\nThere's also a winlog event related to the process lifecycle (Engine Lifecycle) with no file associated, which is less concerning compared to other events.

Each line is a separate JSON object describing an event. Looking at these logs, most of them are about processes running 'powershell.exe' and some related commands. The winlog tasks include things like 'File Create', 'Process Access', 'Registry Event', etc., which suggests various actions being performed by PowerShell.\n\nI notice that multiple entries mention file creation or modifications, such as 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' and others. There are also logs indicating process creation with commands like 'whoami.exe', which is a system tool used to list running processes.\n\nThe presence of PowerShell.exe in many events raises a red flag because PowerShell can be used for malicious activities, such as spawning shells or controlling remote systems. The fact that there's a command line argument pointing to 'C:\\\\pacote_ativo\\\\...' might indicate automation scripts, which could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nAdditionally, some processes have command lines that include system32 files and other paths, suggesting shell execution in different environments. This kind of behavior is often seen when an attacker tries to gain local or remote access without traditional methods like SSH or UNC.\n\nI also see references to .dll files loaded by PowerShell, which might indicate malicious code injection attempts or registry modifications.

That's a red flag because running PowerShell can be dangerous if not properly controlled—it can execute malicious scripts. There are multiple instances where the process name is 'powershell.exe' with various winlog tasks like Image loaded, File created, and Engine Lifecycle.\n\nLooking at the file paths, I notice some familiar ones like C:\\Windows\\assembly and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender, which suggests that the system might be running Windows Defender. But more importantly, there are files being manipulated by PowerShell commands like 'ls -recurse' with childitem and globci arguments. These commands can delete files or traverse directories deeply, which is concerning.\n\nThere's also a command line argument where PowerShell is used to run a script that deletes files recursively: 'powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\\\nget-childitem -recurse\\\\ngci -recurse}'. This kind of automation could be part of a larger malicious campaign targeting specific directories, perhaps leading to data compromise.\n\nAnother point is the presence of winlogbeat.exe with a task of File created. While less concerning on its own, combined with the PowerShell activity, it might indicate ongoing logging activities that are part of a potential breach.\n\nI should also consider if there's any unusual behavior in terms of process timing or frequency. If powershell.exe starts up frequently or at unusual intervals, it could be a sign of compromise. However, without specific timestamps, it's a bit hard to tell here.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of files like 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' might indicate that this is part of an established Windows Defender configuration or update process rather than malicious activity. But when combined with file deletion commands from PowerShell, it could suggest that there's both normal defender operations and some unauthorized actions happening.\n\nI should also check if any files are being modified in a way that could be harmful. The script 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' is deleted, which might be intended but still raises a flag because it's accessing user data directly through PowerShell.\n\nThe registration event (Registry value set) could potentially indicate changes to system settings that might allow unauthorized access or other malicious behaviors. Even if it's just a temporary change, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.\n\nOverall, while some of these files are part of normal Windows Defender operations and legitimate processes, the combination of PowerShell being used to delete files in specific directories and the presence of script execution makes this batch interesting for investigation.
