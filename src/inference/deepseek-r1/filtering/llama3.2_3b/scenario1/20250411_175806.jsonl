{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/scenario1\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSONL batch of events and trying to figure out if it's relevant for investigation. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: process is whoami.exe, command line points to C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe. Winlog says task is Process Create under the rule ProcessCreate. The file is None. Hmm, so it's a system process. Not immediately suspicious unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe with a winlog of Registry value set. File is None. Powershell can be used to hide malicious code or modify system variables without leaving a trail in logs that aren't captured here.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe, command line runs some REG ADD command over the Run key. Winlog says Process Create. The file path points to C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. That seems like an unusual command because it's adding a new entry to the Run key which can be used for legitimate purposes but might indicate configuration changes.\n\nFourth event: reg.exe with similar REG ADD command, same winlog task. File is None. Another instance of modifying system registry entries, possibly unrelated unless done repeatedly in a suspicious manner.\n\nFifth event: reg.exe again but with Registry value set. So this time it's setting a value directly in the registry without adding an entry to Run. Could be trying to change a specific key value which could have implications depending on what that key is used for.\n\nSixth event: conhost.exe with Registry value set winlog task. File is None. Conhost is typically used for connecting remote hosts, maybe for testing or legitimate reasons but setting values here might indicate configuration changes.\n\nSeventh event: powershell.exe again with file created to C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\modulo_padrao.txt. So a file being created via PowerShell could be malicious if it's spreading malware or logging activity. The path is specific, so I'd need more context about what this file does.\n\nEighth event: powershell.exe and winlog says Process accessed. File None again. Maybe the process accessing something unusual but without any file associated here.\n\nPutting all of this together, each process seems to be modifying system settings or creating files via PowerShell which is a red flag. The repeated use of reg.exe commands could indicate that someone is trying to manipulate system properties in non-trivial ways. While some processes are standard like whoami and cmd, the consistent use of PowerShell with file creation and registry modifications points towards potential malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider if these actions are being done by an attacker through different accounts or processes without leaving a trail. The specific file path modulo_padrao.txt might be something the attacker wants to associate themselves with, making it harder for them to deny later.\n\nSo overall, despite each event seeming isolated, together they form a pattern of unusual activity that could indicate compromised systems.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple processes and file operations suggesting potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell for creating files and modifying the system registry indicates suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.\"\n}\n```"}
