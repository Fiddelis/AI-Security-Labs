{"file":"events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events where the process is 'powershell.exe' with various command lines and scheduled task actions. These include executing 'calc.exe', setting up triggers at log-on, assigning user groups, etc. This suggests some automation or scheduled tasks running via PowerShell. That could be concerning if it's malicious, like trying to backdoor a system or install malware.\n\nThere are also some winlog events related to the Registry value being set and ProcessAccess. These aren't immediately alarming but might indicate normal activity unless combined with other evidence.\n\nLooking at the 'file' logs, I notice that one of them references 'C:\\Windows\\assembly\\NativeImages...' which is a known Windows system file. Malicious actors often use these files in their persistence mechanisms, so this could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry for 'chrome.exe' with Pipe Created and Registry events. If this was from a malicious site, it might pose a risk, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of scheduled tasks running via PowerShell with access to calc.exe could indicate legitimate automation (like task schedulers) or something malicious trying to install backdoors or payloads. The reference to a system file in one of the logs is a red flag as these are often used for persistence without leaving trails.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are potential signs of malicious activity mixed with what could be normal behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The presence of scheduled tasks running via PowerShell and references to a system file (C:\\Windows\\assembly\\NativeImages...) suggest potential malicious activity, such as backdoor installation or persistence mechanisms.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events in JSONL format. Each line represents an event from a system log. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most entries are about process names like 'powershell.exe' and 'chrome.exe'. The winlog tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, Engine Lifecycle, and Execute a Remote Command. There are also some file paths provided in the 'file' field.\n\nI see multiple instances where 'powershell.exe' is involved with various tasks related to file creation and deletion, as well as scheduled task registration. The use of 'New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal' suggests automation or potential malicious activity in creating or modifying system files.\n\nThere are a few entries with process names set to 'None', but the winlog tasks here are all about executing remote commands repeatedly. This could indicate an attempt to run malicious code remotely, which is concerning.\n\nThe presence of scheduled task registration ('Register-ScheduledTask') with specific parameters might be legitimate or suspicious. Without more context on what these parameters are for, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination of 'powershell.exe' and scheduled tasks could hint at automation used in attacks.\n\nOverall, the combination of known malicious processes (like PowerShell) being used for file operations, scheduled task registration, and remote command execution points towards potential malicious activity. While I can't confirm it's definitely malicious without more context, the patterns strongly suggest further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The presence of multiple PowerShell processes involved in file operations, scheduled tasks, and remote command execution suggests potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"events\/scenario5\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSONL batch of events and trying to figure out if it's relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of processes like 'WmiPrvSE.exe', 'svchost.exe', and 'powershell.exe'. The winlog entries mention tasks like Image loaded, Registry value set, File created, etc. Some files are listed under the 'file' field, but most don't have specific file paths.\n\nI notice that several processes are running: 'chrome.exe' appears multiple times with various winlog tasks. There's also 'svchost.exe' and 'winlogbeat.exe'. The files mentioned are mostly temporary or user-related, like downloaded files for analysis.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them seem benignâ€”like browser processes. The presence of 'powershell.exe' is a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used to hide malicious scripts. However, without specific evidence of malicious behavior from these events alone, it's hard to classify as suspicious.\n\nThe file paths are generally user-specific and don't point to any obvious malicious locations. The timestamps aren't provided, so I can't check for sudden spikes or correlations between processes and files that might indicate an attack.\n\nThere's a 'winlogbeat.exe' which is used for logging Windows events but isn't inherently malicious on its own unless there's evidence of misconfiguration or misuse. All the winlog tasks are rule-based, like FileCreate, which can be normal user activities without any immediate red flags.\n\nConsidering all this, while there are some potentially suspicious processes and files, there's no clear indication of malicious intent in these logs. Without further context or more specific indicators of compromise, it doesn't seem particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains benign browser processes (e.g., 'chrome.exe'), system monitoring tools ('svchost.exe'), and logging utilities ('winlogbeat.exe'), with some PowerShell execution.
