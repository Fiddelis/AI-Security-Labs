{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This log data appears to be from a Windows system, specifically related to security and system events. Here's an analysis of the data:\n\n**Event Types**\n\nThe data includes various event types, such as:\n\n1. **Process Create**: New processes are created on the system.\n2. **Process Access**: A process accesses or interacts with another resource (e.g., file, registry).\n3. **Process Terminated**: A process is terminated or closed.\n4. **Network Connection Detected**: A network connection is established or detected.\n5. **Registry Value Set**: Registry values are changed or modified.\n\n**Process Names**\n\nThe following processes are mentioned:\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: This process appears to be related to updating the Microsoft Edge browser.\n2. **RuntimeBroker.exe**: This process is a Windows system component, responsible for running brokered applications.\n3. **winlogbeat.exe**: This process is likely related to collecting log data from the system and sending it to an external server.\n\n**System Events**\n\nThe following events are notable:\n\n1. **File created**: Various files are created on the system, including event logs (e.g., `WindowsUpdate.20250418.103848.435.6.etl`).\n2. **Registry value set**: Registry values are changed or modified, which could indicate system configuration changes.\n3. **Network connection detected**: Network connections are established or detected, which might be related to the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process.\n\n**Suspicious Activity**\n\nWhile this analysis is not exhaustive, some potential suspicious activity is mentioned:\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** is creating network connections and accessing files. This could indicate malware or unauthorized access.\n2. **Process terminated**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are being terminated, which might suggest an attempt to evade detection.\n\nTo further investigate these events, you would need to analyze the system's security logs, registry changes, and file system modifications.\n\nIf you'd like me to focus on a specific aspect or ask more questions about this data, please let me know!"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from Winlogbeat, an Elasticsearch Beats module that collects Windows event logs and forwards them to an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for analysis.\n\nHere are some interesting events extracted from the log:\n\n1. **File creation**: Multiple files were created on the system, including `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download\\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}\\135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` and `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe`.\n2. **Process creation**: Processes were created, including `notepad.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.\n3. **Registry value set**: A registry value was set by the `Explorer.EXE` process.\n4. **Dns query**: The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process performed a DNS query.\n5. **File deletion logged**: A file was deleted, but only the log entry for the deletion is available (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{4BB03C95-29DA-492C-9702-EB32AD38100E}-MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe`).\n6. **File creation time changed**: The creation time of a file was modified (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}\\EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp\\setup.exe`).\n\nSome potential security concerns:\n\n* Multiple EdgeUpdate processes were created and interacted with files in the `Download` and `Install` directories, which may be indicative of a potential exploit or malware activity.\n* The creation of multiple temporary files in the `Temp` directory could be related to an ongoing malicious process.\n\nTo investigate further, you can use Kibana's visualization capabilities to create dashboards, charts, and tables that help identify patterns and anomalies in the data. Additionally, you may want to explore the ELK stack documentation for specific guidance on analyzing Winlogbeat logs."}
