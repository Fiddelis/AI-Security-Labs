The logs are in JSON format and contain information about processes, files, and network activity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what I've identified:\n\n1. **Process Creation**: The first log shows that a new process was created: `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This is likely a legitimate Microsoft Edge update process.\n2. **File Creation**: Subsequent logs show creation of various files:\n\t* A file named `135.0.3179.73\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_135.0.3179.73_135.0.3179.66.exe` in the path `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Download`.\n\t* A temporary file named `EDGEMITMP_A31FD.tmp` containing a setup executable (`setup.exe`) in the path `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{5313C3D1-97E5-44DB-9654-1C47A05BDA97}`.\n3. **Network Activity**: None of the logs indicate any suspicious network activity.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that Microsoft Edge is being updated to version 135.0.3179.73 (also known as 135.0.3179.66) through the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. The update files are downloaded and stored in a temporary location (`Download`) before being installed in another folder (`Install`).\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any malicious activity or suspicious behavior associated with these logs.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about potential security threats, I recommend reviewing your system's access control lists (ACLs), checking for any unusual network connections, and verifying that all files and processes are legitimate."}
