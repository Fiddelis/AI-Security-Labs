{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"The log snippet you provided contains multiple events captured from a Windows system, detailing various activities such as file creations, image loads, and registry changes. Here's a breakdown of the notable activities:\n\n1. **File Operations**:\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` is creating a new configuration file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`. This suggests that Winlogbeat, a log shipper for forwarding Windows event logs to Elasticsearch and Logstash, might be setting up or reconfiguring itself.\n   - A temporary file `b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp` is created in the SystemTemp directory. This could be part of an installation process initiated by `setup.exe`.\n\n2. **Image Loads**:\n   - Various processes such as `svchost.exe`, `notepad.exe`, and `Calculator.exe` are loading images like `taskschd.dll` and `urlmon.dll`. These DLLs are associated with Windows Task Scheduler and URL Moniker, respectively.\n   - `smartscreen.exe` is another process that loads `urlmon.dll`. SmartScreen Filter in Windows helps protect against phishing and malware websites.\n\n3. **Registry Operations**:\n   - Multiple registry operations by `svchost.exe` involve setting values and adding or deleting objects. This could be related to the configuration or management of system services.\n   - Similarly, `chrome.exe`, which is associated with Google Chrome, performs several registry value sets. These are likely part of its normal operation for storing settings or configurations.\n\n4. **Dns Queries**:\n   - A DNS query event by `chrome.exe` indicates a network activity where the browser might be resolving domain names to IP addresses as it tries to access websites.\n\n5. **User Account Management and Service Activities**:\n   - An unspecified process handles User Account Management, suggesting some user account operations like creation or modification.\n   - `sppsvc.exe`, which is related to Windows Software Protection Platform, also performs an image load operation on `taskschd.dll`.\n\nOverall, these logs capture a mix of regular system activity and potential software installations or updates. The presence of processes like `winlogbeat.exe` and `setup.exe` points towards configuration changes and new installations, while `chrome.exe` indicates web browsing activities."}
