There are several registry manipulation events with 'cmd.exe' and 'reg.exe' that indicate attempts to set up persistence through the Windows startup folder ('HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run'). Additionally, there's an unusual creation of a '.winlogbeat.yml.new' file by 'winlogbeat.exe', which might suggest tampering with logging configurations. These combined activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior aimed at maintaining persistence and manipulating system settings.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
