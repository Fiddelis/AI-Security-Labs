{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided JSON data contains log entries from a Windows system, detailing various events related to processes and registry operations. Here's an analysis of the key points:\n\n1. **Process Events**:\n   - Several `powershell.exe` commands are logged for creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - The command starts this newly created service immediately after its creation.\n\n2. **Registry Events**:\n   - There are multiple instances of registry value sets for different processes (`services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe`). These events typically indicate modifications to the system registry, which could be related to configuration changes or installations.\n\n3. **Image Loaded Event**:\n   - The task scheduler DLL (`taskschd.dll`) is loaded by the `svchost.exe` process.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**:\n   - There are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks associated with PowerShell commands creating and starting a service. This suggests an automated or scripted operation to manage system services, possibly for maintenance or deployment purposes.\n\n5. **Engine Lifecycle Event**:\n   - An \"Engine Lifecycle\" task is logged alongside the PowerShell command, indicating another layer of lifecycle management related to engine operations within the system's context.\n\n6. **Windows Update Agent and Other Tasks**:\n   - The logs also include entries for a Windows Update Agent and several unspecified tasks marked as \"None,\" which might represent background or maintenance activities not detailed in the log.\n\nOverall, these logs suggest automated service management through PowerShell scripts, potentially indicating routine maintenance operations or software deployment activities on the system. The frequent creation and starting of a specific service (\"objeto_ativo\") could be part of an administrative task or an installation process for certain applications or functionalities."}
