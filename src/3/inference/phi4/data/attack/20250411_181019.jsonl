Loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll also suggests unusual behavior potentially related to bypassing security mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\nThis classification is based on the observation that while `chrome.exe` typically does not perform frequent registry modifications as part of its standard operations, doing so multiple times in quick succession could indicate a compromise or malicious script execution. Additionally, loading critical security-related DLLs like `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` within `chrome.exe` context is unusual and may suggest attempts at anti-detection or system manipulation techniques that are often seen with malware."}
