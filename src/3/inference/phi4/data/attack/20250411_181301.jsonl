{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' setting registry values could indicate potential misuse or persistence mechanisms, especially when combined with other actions like file creation by PowerShell.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Pattern of Behavior**: The batch contains numerous events where `chrome.exe` is involved in setting registry values without any associated files. This pattern could indicate a script or malware using Chrome as a vector to modify system settings, potentially for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\n2. **Diverse Actions**: Alongside the repetitive registry modifications by `chrome.exe`, there are file creation events involving `powershell.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`. PowerShell is often used in legitimate contexts but can also be exploited for executing scripts that perform unwanted actions. The presence of these diverse actions suggests a broader context of system manipulation.\n\n3. **Potential Red Flags**: \n   - **Registry Modifications by Non-System Processes**: While registry modifications are common, repeated changes by `chrome.exe` could indicate an attempt to modify system behavior in a way not typical for a web browser.\n   - **Use of PowerShell and Winlogbeat**: These tools can be legitimate but are also known vectors for executing scripts or gathering data that might be used maliciously.\n\n4. **Confidence Level**: The confidence is set at 0.85 due to the combination of suspicious patterns (repeated registry changes by `chrome.exe`) and other potentially concerning activities (file creation by PowerShell). While these events alone are not definitive proof of malicious activity, they warrant further investigation given their context."}
