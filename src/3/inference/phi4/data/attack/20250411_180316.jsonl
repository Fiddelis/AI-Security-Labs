While loading system files isn't inherently suspicious, when combined with other activities, it can indicate reconnaissance or preparation for malicious actions.\n\n2. **Script Creation and Deletion**: There's a creation of a temporary script file followed by its deletion (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`). This pattern is often associated with attempts to execute scripts that should not be easily traced, possibly indicating an attempt to run malicious PowerShell code.\n\n3. **Conditional Execution Checks**: The logs contain commands using `Test-Path` for conditional checks on paths (`C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`, `C:\\\\modulo_logico\\\\componente_padrao\\\\..\\\\elemento_auxiliar\\\\componente_secundario_script.bat`). This behavior can be part of a lateral movement or execution of scripts in atypical locations, potentially harmful.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by Chrome**: While `chrome.exe` setting registry values is common for legitimate browser configurations, the repetitive nature of these events without context could suggest an attempt to modify settings or persistence mechanisms on the system.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation and Startup Profile Data**: The use of pipes in conjunction with PowerShell can be part of a technique used by attackers to communicate between processes or scripts, adding another layer of potential concern. Additionally, creation of PowerShell startup profile data might indicate attempts to establish persistence.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests behaviors that are often associated with malicious activities, such as preparation for executing code, script obfuscation and persistence mechanisms, and changes to system configurations in an unauthorized manner. This makes the batch interesting enough for further investigation. The confidence level is set at 0.85 due to the presence of multiple indicators which together suggest potential suspicious activity, though each individual event could also be explained by benign use cases."}
