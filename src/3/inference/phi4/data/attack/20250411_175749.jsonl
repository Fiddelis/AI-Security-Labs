Additionally, the presence of 'WmiPrvSE.exe', known for its use in exploiting WMI for persistence and lateral movement, along with numerous 'Registry value set' actions from processes like 'powershell.exe' and 'chrome.exe', raises concerns about potential malicious activity aimed at modifying system settings or establishing persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175749.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows a combination of file creation by 'powershell.exe' and repeated registry modifications by 'chrome.exe', which is unusual for benign behavior. The use of PowerShell to create files can be indicative of script execution, potentially malicious in nature, especially when coupled with multiple registry changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **File Creation Event**:\n   - A file is created by `powershell.exe`, which often implies automation or scripting activity. PowerShell can be leveraged for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, especially when used to create files in sensitive directories (like `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads`).\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple events of registry value setting are triggered by `chrome.exe`. Although Chrome itself could initiate legitimate changes, the frequency and nature of these changes can suggest potential tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up.\n\n3. **Combined Analysis**:\n   - The combination of file creation via PowerShell and frequent registry modifications by a web browser executable is suspicious. Such activities together may indicate an attempt to execute scripts or establish persistence in the system.\n\nThe confidence level reflects that while these events can occur legitimately, their nature and combination strongly suggest potential malicious intent, warranting further investigation."}
