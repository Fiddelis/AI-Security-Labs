{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell, including suspicious command-line executions for screen capturing and registry modifications, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Events**: The batch shows repeated use of `powershell.exe`, which is often leveraged by attackers to execute scripts due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\n2. **Suspicious Command Line Executions**: Several events show PowerShell executing commands for screen capturing, saving images at `$env:TEMP`. This behavior suggests potential surveillance or reconnaissance activity typically associated with malware.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: There are events indicating that `powershell.exe` is setting registry values and accessing processes. Registry modifications can be used to establish persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\n4. **Process Access and Creation Events**: The combination of process access, creation, and image loading events involving system files and PowerShell scripts raises red flags for potential exploitation or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n5. **Diverse Activity Patterns**: The variety of activities (process accesses, registry changes, file operations) in a short period suggests orchestrated actions possibly aiming at achieving an unauthorized objective.\n\nThe combination of these factors justifies the classification as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence due to the indicative signs of potentially malicious activity within the batch."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell scripts executing screenshots and saving them to temporary directories, along with actions such as file creation\/deletion and remote command execution. These activities can be indicative of reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **PowerShell Usage**: The batch includes several PowerShell commands that take screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory. This behavior is suspicious, as it could indicate an attempt to capture sensitive information.\n\n2. **File Operations**: There are events related to file creation and deletion, particularly a script being created and then deleted in the user's temporary folder. This suggests possible manipulation of files for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Remote Commands**: Events indicating execution of remote commands are present, which could imply unauthorized access or control over the system.\n\n4. **Pipeline and Process Access**: There are logs related to pipeline execution details and process access, which might be part of an attempt to execute further malicious activities.\n\n5. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple registry value set events are noted, which can be a sign of persistence mechanisms being installed by malware.\n\nOverall, the combination of these actions across different processes raises significant concern for potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation. The confidence level is high due to the presence of multiple suspicious activities that align with known attack patterns."}
