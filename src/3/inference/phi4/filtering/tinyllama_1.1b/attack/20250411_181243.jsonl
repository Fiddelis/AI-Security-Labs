Multiple registry value sets, image loads of critical system components (e.g., MpOAV.dll, clr.dll), and creation and deletion of a suspicious script file are observed. Additionally, command lines executed by PowerShell include common enumeration commands targeting user accounts and local groups. The repeated use of 'powershell.exe' for various tasks such as loading images, creating files, and executing system commands is atypical and could be indicative of an attacker leveraging scripts to compromise the system.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
