The presence of both legitimate and suspicious processes performing file creation and registry changes suggests potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n``` \n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **File Creation Events:** \n   - Multiple files related to Microsoft Edge are created by `setup.exe`. This can be normal, but the presence of multiple executable files being created might indicate tampering or a disguised installation process.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Several registry modifications occur through `svchost.exe` and `setup.exe`. While `svchost.exe` is typically associated with Windows services, it's often used in malware to perform various actions due to its legitimate nature.\n   - Registry changes by `setup.exe`, alongside file creation events, might be indicative of a script or installer being misused for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - The use of `setup.exe` (a common name for installers) performing both file creations and registry modifications raises suspicion.\n   - Multiple processes modifying the registry suggest potential persistence mechanisms being set up, which is a common behavior in malware operations.\n\n4. **Confidence Level:**\n   - Given the combination of events involving file creation by an installer-like process (`setup.exe`) and registry changes by `svchost.exe`, there's significant cause for concern. However, without more context or direct evidence of malicious payloads, absolute certainty cannot be claimed, hence the confidence level is set at 0.85."}
