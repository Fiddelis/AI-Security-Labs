{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell-related events involving script execution and image loading, along with network activity from ssh.exe, suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **PowerShell Activity**: The presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing commands (e.g., `powershell.exe` running scripts and loading images like `mscoree.dll`) is often associated with script-based attacks or lateral movement in a network.\n\n2. **Script Creation**: A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) was created, which could be indicative of an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts.\n\n3. **Network Activity**: The `ssh.exe` process is involved in file creation and network connections, which might suggest data exfiltration or command and control activities if unauthorized.\n\n4. **Registry and Image Load Events**: Registry modifications by `Explorer.EXE` and loading of system DLLs by PowerShell may indicate attempts to alter the environment or execute malicious payloads.\n\nOverall, these patterns combined suggest a need for further investigation into potential security incidents. The confidence level reflects that while these events are indicative of suspicious activity, they are not conclusive proof without additional context."}
