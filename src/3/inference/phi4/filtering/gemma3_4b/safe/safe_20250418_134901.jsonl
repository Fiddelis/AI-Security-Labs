These logs are structured in JSON format, detailing various events such as process creation, file operations, image loading, and registry changes. Here's a breakdown of the key components found within these logs:\n\n1. **Process Events**:\n   - **Process Create**: When a new process starts (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`, `notepad.exe`).\n   - **Image Load**: Occurs when a DLL or executable is loaded into memory by a process (`urlmon.dll`).\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - **File Created**: A file has been created in the system (e.g., `.winlogbeat.yml.new`).\n   - Paths indicate where these files are stored, such as within user directories or system folders.\n\n3. **Registry Events**:\n   - **Registry Value Set**: Changes to values within the Windows registry, indicating configuration changes or software installations.\n   - **Registry Object Added\/Deleted**: Indicates structural changes in the registry (e.g., keys being added or removed).\n\n4. **Network and DNS Queries**:\n   - **Dns Query**: Shows network activity related to domain name resolution, often associated with applications like web browsers (`chrome.exe`).\n\n5. **User Account Management**:\n   - Events related to user accounts, possibly indicating login\/logout activities.\n\n6. **Service Operations**:\n   - Events involving Windows services (e.g., `svchost.exe`) which manage various system functions and background tasks.\n\nThese logs provide a detailed view of system activities that can be useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, or security auditing purposes. Each log entry includes the name of the process responsible for the action and sometimes additional metadata such as file paths or registry keys involved."}
