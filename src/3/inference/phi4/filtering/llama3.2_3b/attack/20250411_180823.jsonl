Additionally, there are repeated registry modifications and image load events from a trusted process (chrome.exe) into a potentially sensitive file path (amsi.dll), which could suggest attempts at evasion or privilege escalation. These combined behaviors warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
