Additionally, there are other potentially concerning activities: an 'Image loaded' event with 'MpOAV.dll', a known Windows Defender component; a 'Process Create' event for svchost.exe executing a non-standard service (NgcCtnrSvc), which could indicate masquerading malicious activity as a legitimate process; and file creation events by powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe.
