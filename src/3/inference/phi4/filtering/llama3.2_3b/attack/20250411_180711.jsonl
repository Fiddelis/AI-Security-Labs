Its repeated invocation could suggest an attempt to gather user information.\n- **powershell.exe**: Multiple accesses to `powershell.exe` without any specific command line arguments can be a red flag, especially when combined with suspicious activities involving other executables like `whoami.exe`. This pattern often indicates potential misuse of PowerShell for executing scripts or commands that could compromise the system.\n\nGiven these patterns, the batch is classified as \"INTERESTING\" due to the combination of events suggesting possible malicious behavior. The confidence level reflects a strong suspicion based on typical indicators of compromise but acknowledges the lack of explicit command line details in the `powershell.exe` entries."}
