The repetitive creation of temporary files by `svchost.exe` and the user creation commands using `net.exe` and `net1.exe` raise significant concerns about potential malicious activity. The use of what appears to be `net1.exe` is also concerning, as this is not a standard Windows command.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
