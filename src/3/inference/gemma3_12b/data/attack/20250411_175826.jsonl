This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, such as hiding file modification times to evade detection or manipulating file integrity checks. The presence of calc.exe, Calculator.exe and winlogbeat.exe are not particularly concerning individually, but the persistent PowerShell activity warrants further investigation.
