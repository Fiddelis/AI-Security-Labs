The naming conventions for the added users (`modulo_geral_Admin`, `modulo_principal_Admin`, etc.) suggest a possible automated process or script. The presence of `net1.exe` is also suspicious, as it is not a standard Windows executable. Although User and Security Group Management events are present, the associated process is 'None,' which is not suspicious on its own, itâ€™s the combination with the other events that raises concern.  The combination of user creation and group modifications warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
