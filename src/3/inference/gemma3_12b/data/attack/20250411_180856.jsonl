The use of WMIC is a common technique for attackers to execute commands and download\/inject malicious payloads. The presence of the registry event rules alongside these actions raises suspicion. Additionally, winlogbeat activity suggests a potential deployment of security tools, which could be legitimate or part of an attacker's reconnaissance or obfuscation. This combination of events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
