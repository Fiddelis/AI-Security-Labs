{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log file details a series of actions performed on a Windows system, likely indicating a suspicious or malicious process. Let's break down what's happening.  I'll group the events for clarity and highlight critical areas.\n\n**1. Initial Intrusion and File Operations (Potential Exploit\/Initial Access)**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` Create and Registry Modification:** The initial presence of `powershell.exe` is a significant red flag. PowerShell is a legitimate scripting language, but it's frequently abused by attackers to execute malicious commands.  The `Registry value set` associated with `services.exe` could be an attempt to manipulate system services.\n*   **`Remove-Item` Command:**  `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force}`  This is *highly* suspicious.  It's using PowerShell to delete a ZIP file named `entrada_principal.zip` located in the user's temporary directory.  The `-Force` parameter means it's deleting the file without prompting.  This suggests an attempt to remove evidence of a previously downloaded or extracted malicious file.  The naming convention (`entrada_principal`) strongly implies this file contained a malicious payload.\n*   **Creation and Immediate Deletion of a PowerShell Script:** The `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` script being created and immediately deleted is another attempt to evade detection.  Creating a script, even a small one, can trigger security alerts, so quickly deleting it can be part of an attacker's attempt to hide their actions. The naming scheme, while seemingly random, is likely an attempt to disguise the purpose of the script.\n\n**2. PowerShell Execution and DLL Loading (Malicious Payload Execution)**\n\n*   **Extensive DLL Loading by PowerShell:**  The PowerShell process then loads multiple DLLs, including:\n    *   `mscoree.dll` (Microsoft Common Language Runtime – core component for .NET applications)\n    *   `clr.dll` (Common Language Runtime – part of .NET)\n    *   `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll` (PowerShell automation library)\n    *   `mscorlib.dll` (Base .NET classes)\n    *   `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender Component) -  Loading this DLL may be an attempt to use Defender's resources for malicious purposes or to disable certain Defender protections.\n*   **These DLLs are required to execute .NET based malware.** This points to a possible .NET based malicious payload.\n\n**3. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Recommendations**\n\n*   **File Name:** `entrada_principal.zip` - Immediately search your system for this file or remnants of its contents.\n*   **Script Name:** `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` –  Check if this file exists anywhere on the system and investigate its contents if found.\n*   **PowerShell Activity:**  The extensive use of PowerShell is a critical indicator. Disable or restrict PowerShell if possible.\n*   **DLL Loading:**  The loading of `.NET` DLLs indicates the possible execution of a .NET malware.\n*   **`MpOAV.dll` loading:** This should be investigated as it might represent an attempt to compromise Windows Defender.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Disconnect the affected system from the network immediately to prevent further propagation.\n2.  **Run a Full Malware Scan:** Use a reputable antivirus\/anti-malware solution to perform a full system scan, including a deep scan. Consider using multiple tools for increased effectiveness.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Tighten PowerShell execution policies to restrict script execution.\n4.  **Investigate User Account:** Examine the user account (`fiddelis`) that's associated with this activity. Check login history, recent activity, and any associated permissions.\n5.  **Examine Network Connections:** Analyze network connections made by the affected system to identify potential command-and-control servers or other compromised systems.\n6.  **Review System Logs:** Examine system logs (Windows Event Logs) for additional clues about the intrusion and attacker activity.\n7.  **Restore from Backup:** If possible, restore the system from a clean backup that predates the intrusion.\n8. **Implement Application Whitelisting:** This technique can prevent unauthorized executables, like PowerShell scripts and executables, from running on the system.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   This analysis is based solely on the provided log file.  A more thorough investigation is required to fully understand the scope of the compromise.\n*   Attackers often attempt to cover their tracks, so the log file may not contain a complete picture of the intrusion.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious situation. It's likely that this system has been compromised. Prompt action is crucial to contain the threat and prevent further damage."}
