{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, along with explanations and potential impact:\n\n**1. Initial Execution & Task Scheduler:**\n\n*   **`taskschd.dll`:** The initial event indicates something related to Task Scheduler.  It suggests a scheduled task or something triggered by the system's Task Scheduler was initiated. This is a common initial point for malicious scripts, as they can be executed automatically.\n*   **`services.exe` & `sppsvc.exe`:** Standard Windows system processes. Their involvement is expected but doesn't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own.\n*   **`svchost.exe`:** This is a generic host process for Windows services.  Its appearance here is not unusual.\n\n**2. PowerShell Introduction:**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` (First appearance):**  The first explicit mention of PowerShell indicates the start of malicious activity.\n*   **`whoami.exe`:** A PowerShell command used to determine the user account associated with the running process.\n\n**3. File Deletion - Trying to Hide Tracks**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe` & File Deletion:** The script uses `powershell.exe` to delete a file: `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.\n    *  The filename `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` suggests that the PowerShell script attempted to test the execution policy of PowerShell, which is a technique to bypass security restrictions.  The script might have changed PowerShell's execution policy to allow its own execution.\n    *  The file is located in the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` folder which is a common location for temporary files created by scripts and programs.  Deleting temporary files is a standard tactic for malware to cover its tracks.\n\n**4. Potential Malicious Actions & Indicators:**\n\n*   **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:**  This command is the most significant indicator of malicious behavior. It deletes all files with the `.zip` extension from the userâ€™s temporary directory.  The variable `$env:Temp` refers to the user's temporary directory.\n*   **`mscoree.dll` and other .NET framework DLLs:**  The loading of these DLLs suggests the PowerShell script uses .NET functionality.\n*   **`Platform\\\\4.18.25050.5-0\\\\MpOAV.dll`:**  Relates to Windows Defender. This might suggest an attempt to disable or circumvent Windows Defender.\n\n**Summary and Analysis:**\n\nThe script is attempting to achieve the following:\n\n1.  **Persistence:**  The use of Task Scheduler suggests an attempt to establish persistence.\n2.  **Cleanup:**  The script deletes files from the temporary directory to hide evidence of its actions, specifically a test file related to PowerShell execution policy.\n3.  **Data Deletion:**  The script deletes `.zip` files, potentially an attempt to delete data.\n4. **Antivirus Bypass:** The script tried to use Windows defender files, and it could be trying to avoid detection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Investigate the Task Scheduler:**  Examine the scheduled tasks on the system to identify the task that launched the script.\n*   **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Check the PowerShell execution policies to see if they have been changed.\n*   **Scan the System:**  Perform a full system scan with a reputable antivirus solution.\n*   **Monitor PowerShell Activity:**  Implement monitoring of PowerShell activity to detect suspicious commands.\n*   **Review User Activity:** If possible, review the user activity logs to see if the user was involved in the execution of the script.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an automated analysis based on the provided log data. A comprehensive investigation may be required to determine the full extent of the compromise."}
