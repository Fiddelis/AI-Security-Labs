{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data suggests a potential malicious activity involving the creation and starting of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using a PowerShell script. Here's a breakdown of the findings and potential implications:\n\n**Key Observations & Analysis:**\n\n* **PowerShell Service Creation:**  The recurring log entries featuring the command line `powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}` are extremely concerning.  This command uses PowerShell to:\n    * **Create a new Windows service:** `New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"` creates a service named \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\" in Portuguese).\n    * **Specify a binary path:** `-BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"` points to an executable `tarefa_logico.exe`.  This is the program that the service will run.\n    * **Start the service:** `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"` immediately starts the newly created service.\n* **Suspicious Binary Path:** The path `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` is highly suspicious. The directory names (especially \"unidade_logico\" – logic unit, \"registro_comum\" – common registry, \"entrada_base\" – base input) don't seem to follow standard Windows paths.  It suggests a custom location, likely placed by the attacker.  The filename `tarefa_logico.exe` (logic task) is also indicative of a custom executable.\n* **Service Naming:** The service name \"objeto_ativo\" is generic enough to be overlooked, but its Portuguese translation points to a localized attack, potentially targeting Portuguese-speaking users or systems.\n* **Multiple Attempts:** The repeated execution of this PowerShell command shows a deliberate effort to establish the service.  It's possible the initial attempt failed and was re-tried.  The change in \"Provider Lifecycle\" to \"Engine Lifecycle\" might indicate a later attempt in the process.\n* **File Deletion Event:** The initial log entry regarding `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe` suggests a cleanup or a way to hide the binary.\n* **Registry Value Sets:** Changes in the registry indicate configuration or modifications to the Windows system.\n* **Image Load:** The log shows `sppsvc.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`, likely related to scheduled tasks.  This could be involved in persistence mechanisms.\n\n**Potential Implications & Concerns:**\n\n* **Malware Persistence:** Creating a Windows service is a common technique for malware to ensure it runs automatically on startup and survives system reboots.  The service could be used to:\n    * Download and execute further malicious code.\n    * Steal data.\n    * Monitor user activity.\n    * Establish a backdoor for remote access.\n* **System Compromise:** The presence of a service created in this manner strongly suggests that the system has been compromised.\n* **Data Exfiltration:** The service could be designed to steal sensitive information from the system and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server.\n* **Remote Access:** The service could provide a backdoor, allowing an attacker to remotely access and control the infected system.\n\n**Recommendations & Remediation Steps:**\n\n1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the infected system from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.\n2. **Run a Full System Scan:** Perform a thorough scan of the system using a reputable antivirus and anti-malware solution. Ensure the definitions are up-to-date.\n3. **Examine the Service:**\n   * **Stop and Disable the Service:**  Open the Services app (services.msc) and locate the \"objeto_ativo\" service.  Stop the service and disable it.  (Note: This may cause instability if the service is integrated with other critical functions – proceed with caution or consult an expert.)\n   * **Delete the Service:** Open an elevated Command Prompt and use the `sc delete \"objeto_ativo\"` command to permanently remove the service.\n4. **Investigate the Binary:**  Carefully examine the `tarefa_logico.exe` executable.  Submit it to a sandbox environment (like VirusTotal) for analysis.\n5. **Check Scheduled Tasks:** Open Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc) and carefully review all scheduled tasks, looking for any suspicious entries that might be related to the malware.\n6. **Review Registry Keys:** Investigate registry keys related to the service and scheduled tasks to identify any further modifications made by the malware.\n7. **Restore from Backup:** If available, restore the system from a clean backup.\n8. **Change Passwords:** Change passwords for all user accounts on the affected system and any other systems that may have been accessed by the attacker.\n9. **Security Hardening:** Review and strengthen system security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and user access controls.\n10. **Incident Response:** Follow your organization's incident response plan to handle the security breach.\n11. **Portuguese Language Analysis:** Given the Portuguese language elements in the paths and service name, consider involving someone familiar with Portuguese-speaking threat actors.\n\n**Important:** This situation is serious and requires immediate attention. If you lack the expertise to handle this incident, consult a qualified cybersecurity professional. This analysis is based solely on the provided log snippets and doesn't constitute a complete forensic investigation. A full forensic examination would be required to determine the full scope of the compromise and the attacker's objectives."}
