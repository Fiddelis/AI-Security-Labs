The temporary PowerShell script `__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1` is created, executed, and then deleted, suggesting a scripting obfuscation technique.

The scheduled task creation using calc.exe as an example and then subsequently being run by svchost.exe is suspicious. The creation of a file in a user's PowerShell startup folder further reinforces this concern.
