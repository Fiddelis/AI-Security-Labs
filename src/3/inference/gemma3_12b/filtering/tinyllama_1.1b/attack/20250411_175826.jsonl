Specifically, the creation and subsequent deletion of temporary PowerShell script files, the loading of numerous .NET framework DLLs, registry modifications, unusual file modification actions (setting LastWriteTime to a fixed date), and the presence of a PowerShell startup script file being created raise suspicion of a potential attack or suspicious system behavior.
