Several `winlogbeat.exe` file creations are also present. The creation of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1) and SSH key file creation are also notable, suggesting potential suspicious activity. The interaction of `svchost.exe` with XboxLive data is unusual and warrants review.  While some events are related to Winlogbeat installation, the overall pattern and combination of events warrant further investigation for potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
