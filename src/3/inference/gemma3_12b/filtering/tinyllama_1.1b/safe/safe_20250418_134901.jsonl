{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, here's a breakdown of the events you've provided, grouped and categorized for better understanding.  I'll summarize the key activity and note any potentially concerning items.\n\n**I. Initial Setup & Winlogbeat Configuration**\n\n*   **File Creation:** `winlogbeat.exe` created a new file: `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new` (Multiple occurrences) -  This indicates initial configuration or modification of the Winlogbeat configuration file. This is normal during setup.\n\n**II. System Processes & Tasks**\n\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` Image Load:** Loaded `taskschd.dll` - Part of Software Protection service, loading the task scheduler DLL. Normal.\n*   **`notepad.exe` Image Load:** Loaded `urlmon.dll` -  Notepad loading the URL Monitor DLL. Unusual. Could point to Notepad attempting to open a URL, potentially malicious.\n*   **`taskhostw.exe` Image Load:** Loaded `taskschd.dll` - Task Host loading the task scheduler DLL. Part of scheduled task execution.\n*   **`OneDriveLauncher.exe` Image Load:** Loaded `urlmon.dll` - OneDrive launcher using the URL monitor DLL. Normal for loading web resources.\n*   **`SDXHelper.exe` Image Loads:** Several loads of `combase.dll` and `urlmon.dll`. This process needs further investigation.  It might be legitimate software, but the URL monitor DLL usage and the name suggest potential for malicious activity.\n\n**III.  Microsoft Services & Registry Activity**\n\n*   **`svchost.exe` - Multiple Registry Events:** Several Registry events associated with `svchost.exe`. These are common, as `svchost` hosts many services. Without more context on the registry keys being modified, it's difficult to determine if these are legitimate.\n*   **`chrome.exe` - Multiple Registry Events & DNS Query:**  Multiple registry changes and a DNS query from Chrome. Chrome itself is a frequent target, and the registry changes require further analysis for potential malicious modification. The DNS query indicates web browsing activity.\n\n**IV. User Account Management (UAM)**\n\n*   **Multiple UAM Events**: Indicates user account modifications. This could be administrative actions, user actions, or potentially malicious attempts to manipulate accounts. Needs detailed review of the specific changes.\n\n**Potential Concerns & Areas for Further Investigation**\n\n*   **`SDXHelper.exe`:** This is the most concerning process. The name \"SDXHelper\" is not standard, and the use of `urlmon.dll` is suggestive of web-related activity. Investigate the origin of this file, its purpose, and its behavior. Run a virus scan.\n*   **Notepad loading `urlmon.dll`:** This is quite unusual. Check what URL Notepad is attempting to open. This is a red flag.\n*   **Chrome Registry Changes:** Review these modifications. See if they correspond to legitimate Chrome functionality or if they are signs of malicious alteration.\n*   **`svchost.exe` Registry Changes:** More information is needed to evaluate these. Look at the specific registry keys being modified.\n*   **User Account Management Events (UAM):**  Review these to understand if they are authorized or potentially unauthorized.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:** This is your top priority.\n2.  **Review Notepadâ€™s URL Activity:** See what the URL is, and why Notepad is attempting to open it.\n3.  **Analyze Chrome Registry Changes:**  Look for anything unusual or unauthorized.\n4.  **Monitor User Account Management:**  Track all UAM activities to detect any suspicious modifications.\n5.  **Run Antivirus\/Malware Scan:** Perform a thorough scan of the system.\n6.  **Examine Process Dependencies:**  Use tools to examine the dependencies of `SDXHelper.exe` and identify other processes it interacts with.\n\n\n\nTo help me give you more targeted advice, could you provide the following:\n\n*   **Source of `SDXHelper.exe`:** Where did this file come from? Was it installed intentionally?\n*   **Details of Registry Changes:** Can you provide the specific registry keys being modified by `svchost.exe` and `chrome.exe`?\n*   **The URL being attempted by Notepad.**\n*   **More details about the specific User Account Management actions.**"}
