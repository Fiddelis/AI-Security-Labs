The scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) which suggests potential obfuscation or an attempt to hide the true purpose of the executed commands. While other events related to Chrome and Winlogbeat exist, the scheduled task activity patterns raise concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
