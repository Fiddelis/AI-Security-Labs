The execution of a script from a remote location, coupled with the bypassing of PowerShell's execution policy, strongly suggests malicious activity such as downloading and running malware or performing reconnaissance.  Furthermore, the use of techniques like encoded commands is characteristic of attempts to evade detection.  The file creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script also raises suspicion. The presence of multiple lifecycle events connected to powershell commands further suggests automated or complex activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
