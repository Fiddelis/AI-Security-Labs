{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"Here's a breakdown of the events, consolidating and interpreting the information:\n\n**1. XML Payload (Likely the Main Event)**\n\n*   **HTML:** A complex HTML structure (not relevant to understanding the core actions but suggests this might be part of a larger web-based system).  The `data-process-id` attribute contains a long, seemingly random string, likely a unique identifier.\n*   **`winlog`:** This section indicates a \"Process Create\" event.  The \"rule\" is specifically \"ProcessCreate\". This signals a new process has been started.  It's a key indicator of something being initiated.\n*   **`file`:** This is listed as \"None,\" suggesting the process wasn't directly spawned from a file execution (at least, as far as the detection mechanism can see).\n\n**2. Subsequent Events (Repeating)**\n\n*   **`winlog`:**  \"None\". This indicates a lack of detected activity, possibly normal operation or the detection mechanism didn't register an event.\n*   **`file`:** \"None\".  No file interaction recorded.\n\n**3. PowerShell Service Creation and Startup (Critical Activity)**\n\nThis section reveals a PowerShell command being executed:\n\n*   **`process`:**  A PowerShell command. Specifically, it's creating and starting a Windows Service named \"objeto\\_ativo\".\n    *   `New-Service`:  This PowerShell cmdlet creates a new Windows service.\n        *   `-Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:  Names the service \"objeto\\_ativo\".  The name itself suggests a potentially malicious or unusual purpose.\n        *   `-BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`:  Specifies the executable file that will run when the service starts.  **This path is highly suspicious.**  The directory names (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, `entrada_base`)  suggest a non-standard location, potentially indicating a hidden or malicious installation.  The name `tarefa_logico.exe` also sounds very generic.\n    *   `Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`: This starts the newly created service.\n\n**Summary & Analysis**\n\nThis sequence of events suggests a potential threat:\n\n1.  **Process Creation:** A process (likely an attacker's tool or script) is initiated.\n2.  **Service Creation & Startup:**  This is the most concerning part. The attacker is creating and starting a Windows service named \"objeto\\_ativo.\"  This gives the malicious code persistence â€“ it will automatically run even after the system restarts.\n    *   **Persistence:**  Creating a Windows service is a common tactic for malware to maintain a foothold on a system.\n    *   **Obfuscation:** The unusual path to the executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`) strongly suggests that the attacker is trying to hide the malicious file.  The seemingly random file names further complicate analysis.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n*   **Immediate Investigation:**  The system exhibiting these activities should be immediately investigated.\n*   **File Analysis:** The `tarefa_logico.exe` file *must* be analyzed in a sandbox environment to determine its actual purpose.\n*   **Registry Review:**  The Windows Service registry entries for \"objeto\\_ativo\" need to be examined.  This will reveal the full configuration of the service (arguments, dependencies, etc.).  Locate the key under `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services`.\n*   **Process Tree Analysis:**  Trace the parent process of the initial process creation to identify the origin of the attack.\n*   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network connections from the system for any unusual activity.\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Employ robust EDR solutions to proactively detect and respond to threats.\n*   **Review System Configuration:** Scrutinize system configurations, user accounts, and scheduled tasks for any signs of tampering.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided data. A full investigation would require more information about the system and its environment."}
