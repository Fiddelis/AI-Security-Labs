{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This log data represents a series of actions performed by a system, primarily involving PowerShell. Let's break down what's happening and analyze the potential implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**  The data describes an attacker or automated script attempting to disable security measures, execute commands, and potentially establish persistence on the system.  The actions include attempts to delete files, modify registry keys, and run PowerShell scripts.  While the script execution appears to try and be stealthy (restricted execution policy), it's clearly malicious.  The final command suggests a test or confirmation that previous actions have succeeded.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Events:**\n\n1. **Initial PowerShell Script Execution:** A PowerShell script is launched. The script includes code to remove a ZIP archive from a temporary directory. This strongly suggests the attacker is deploying or cleaning up after deploying malicious files.\n2. **PowerShell Script - Restricted Execution Policy:** The attacker attempts to run a PowerShell script with the `Restricted` execution policy.  This is an important tactic. By explicitly setting the execution policy, they're attempting to bypass standard security settings and run their script.  This is a common tactic used to overcome security restrictions.\n3. **Image Loading:** The PowerShell process dynamically loads several DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries): `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. These are all core components of the .NET framework, which is what PowerShell relies on. The attacker is leveraging these libraries to execute their commands.\n4. **File Deletion:** The script successfully deletes `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`.  This file likely contained a part of the malicious script or configuration.  The `__PSScriptPolicyTest` prefix might have been used to try and bypass detection.\n5. **Windows Defender Interaction:** The script loads `MpClient.dll`, indicating interaction with Windows Defender. This could be an attempt to disable or evade detection by the antivirus software.\n6. **Registry Modification:** A registry value is set, the nature of this value is unknown but almost certainly represents a configuration change made by the attacker to allow for persistent execution.\n7. **Final Confirmation Command:** The final command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` is significant.  It executes a command through PowerShell, even with a Restricted Execution Policy (demonstrating that restrictions have been bypassed or altered), and prints \"Final result: 1.\" This is likely a signal to the attacker that the script has executed successfully and to proceed with subsequent actions.\n\n**Indicators of Potential Compromise & Possible Attack Stages:**\n\n*   **File Deletion from Temp Directory:**  Malicious scripts often place files in temporary directories and delete them after execution.\n*   **Bypassing Execution Policy:** Explicitly setting the execution policy indicates an attempt to override security measures.\n*   **DLL Loading (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll):** The attacker is leveraging the .NET framework, which is commonly used by PowerShell.\n*   **Interaction with Windows Defender:** The attacker attempts to interact with Windows Defender.\n*   **Registry Modification:**  Almost certainly configuration changes have been performed.\n*   **Final Confirmation Command:** Suggests a chain of actions intended to achieve a specific goal.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediately Isolate the Affected System:** Prevent further spread of the malware.\n2.  **Run a Full System Scan:**  Use a reputable antivirus or anti-malware solution.\n3.  **Analyze Registry Changes:**  Identify and reverse any modifications made to the Windows Registry.\n4.  **Investigate Scheduled Tasks:** Check for any newly created or modified scheduled tasks.\n5.  **Review User Account Activity:** Examine user account activity for any suspicious logins or changes.\n6.  **Implement or Strengthen PowerShell Security:**  Restrict PowerShell execution policies, monitor PowerShell logs, and consider using PowerShell mitigation tools.\n7.  **Implement a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) System:**  To centrally collect and analyze security logs, enabling quicker detection of suspicious activity.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide definitive security advice. This analysis is based solely on the provided log data and should be verified by a qualified cybersecurity professional."}
