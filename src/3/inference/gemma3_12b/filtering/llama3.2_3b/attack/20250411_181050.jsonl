This activity is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious code obfuscation or execution.  The creation of multiple temporary files and decoding them suggests a complex process happening, beyond normal system activity. The usage of `SDXHelper.exe` loading DLLs like `combase.dll` warrants further inspection to understand its role. Frequent registry modifications by Chrome also raise some concerns, though less significant than the `certutil` activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
