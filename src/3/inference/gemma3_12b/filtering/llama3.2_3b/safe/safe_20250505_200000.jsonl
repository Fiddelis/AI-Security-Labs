Also, multiple special logons and temporary files created by `svchost.exe` warrant investigation. The `DrvInst.exe` registry modifications, while not inherently malicious, suggest possible driver updates or modifications, which, if unauthorized, could indicate compromise. The frequent use of `urlmon.dll` in conjunction with different processes is also notable.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
