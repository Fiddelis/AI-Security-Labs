Winlogbeat is creating lock files, new YAML configuration files, and log files, which could indicate configuration changes or data collection issues. More concerning are multiple PowerShell executions, including a script policy test (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1`) followed by its deletion, and a large number of 'Provider Lifecycle' events, suggesting a script or tool interacting with PowerShell providers repeatedly.  These actions, especially combined, warrant investigation to determine if they are legitimate or represent malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
