Repeated network connections originating from Chrome, PowerShell and cmd.exe coupled with registry modifications by cmd.exe, PowerShell, and wmiprvse.exe indicate possible reconnaissance or initial stages of a more complex attack. The WMIC activity loading Defender-related DLLs is likely normal, but warrants further observation alongside other processes. The download and creation of winlogbeat config also raises concerns.
