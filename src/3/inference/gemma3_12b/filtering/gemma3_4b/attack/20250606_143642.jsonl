{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Okay, let's break down this log data and analyze what's happening.\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThis log data indicates a likely malicious PowerShell script execution. It begins with typical process creation and registry modifications and rapidly escalates to downloading, executing, and deleting a potentially malicious PowerShell script. The download and immediate deletion attempt to evade detection.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Initial Activity:**\n    *   `whoami.exe`: This is a standard process used to determine the user's identity.  Often used to establish context before running scripts.\n    *   `powershell.exe`: The primary process involved.\n\n2.  **Script Download & Execution:**\n    *   `powershell.exe` is launched, followed by a complex command string involving `Remove-Item` This strongly suggests that the PowerShell script is attempting to delete itself immediately after running.  The script name `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is likely a randomly generated filename, intended to make detection harder. The use of the random string also suggests script obfuscation.\n\n3.  **Library Loading (Image Loads):**\n    *   The `powershell.exe` process is loading several libraries: `mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll`.  These are standard .NET and PowerShell libraries. Loading `MpOAV.dll` suggests a potential connection to Windows Defender.\n\n4. **File creation and immediate deletion**:\n    * The script created a PowerShell script and then tried to delete immediately after. This behavior is used to evade detection mechanisms.\n\n**Key Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**\n\n*   **Self-Deletion:** The use of `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` and the subsequent creation then deletion of the script is a **major red flag**.  Malware often attempts to delete itself to hide its presence on the system. The name `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` is suspect. It is unlikely to be a standard PowerShell script.\n*   **Temp Folder Usage:** The use of the `$env:Temp` directory (the temporary folder) is common for malware to store downloaded files or run scripts.\n*   **Rapid Script Lifecycle:** The extremely short lifecycle of the PowerShell script (creation, execution, deletion) is designed to avoid detection by monitoring tools.\n*   **Windows Defender Connection**: The loading of `MpOAV.dll` suggests a connection to Windows Defender, which could mean the script is trying to disable or bypass security features.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.\n2.  **Run a Full System Scan:** Perform a thorough scan with an updated antivirus\/anti-malware solution.\n3.  **Examine Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic to see where the script was downloaded from and if there is any communication with external servers.\n4.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Check PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.\n5.  **Monitor for Similar Activity:**  Implement monitoring for suspicious PowerShell activity, particularly scripts downloaded and executed from temporary folders.\n6.  **Investigate the Download Source:** Trace the origin of the downloaded PowerShell script to identify the source of the infection and prevent future attacks.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided log data. A more comprehensive investigation, including forensic analysis, may be necessary to confirm the nature of the activity and its impact on the system."}
