{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"This sequence of events describes a malicious PowerShell script execution. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, grouped by key stages and highlighting the suspicious activity:\n\n**1. Initial Execution & Setup (Task Scheduler, Registry)**\n\n*   **`services.exe`**:  A legitimate Windows service executable. Its presence early on might be normal, but it can be leveraged by malicious scripts.\n*   **`sppsvc.exe` & `taskschd.dll`**: This indicates the use of the Task Scheduler.  Malicious actors frequently use Task Scheduler to ensure persistence - meaning the script will run again even after a reboot. The `taskschd.dll` is crucial because it's the Task Scheduler DLL.\n*   **`svchost.exe`**: A Windows system process that hosts services. The Registry Value Set could be related to configuring a service.\n\n**2. PowerShell Engagement & Core Malicious Activity**\n\n*   **`powershell.exe`**: The core of the attack.  The PowerShell interpreter is used to execute commands.\n*   **`whoami.exe`**: Used to determine the current userâ€™s identity. It is potentially gathering information.\n*   **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`**:  **Critical Malicious Activity**. This PowerShell command *deletes* a ZIP file named \"entrada_principal.zip\" from the user's temporary folder (`$env:Temp`).  This is a strong indicator of cleanup activity. The attacker likely downloaded or created this ZIP file as part of the initial infection, and this command is designed to cover their tracks.  The `-Force` flag ensures that the deletion happens without prompting.\n\n**3. PowerShell Execution Environment & Cleanup**\n\n*   **Multiple DLL loads (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, MpOAV.dll):**  These are .NET framework and PowerShell libraries, loaded during script execution. Their presence is expected for PowerShell but shows the script is leveraging the .NET framework. The `MpOAV.dll` is potentially from Windows Defender.\n*   **`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`:** The script creates a temporary file and immediately deletes it. This is a common tactic to evade detection by security tools.  The name suggests it's a test to see the current PowerShell Execution Policy. By creating and deleting this file, it might be trying to test for restrictions on script execution.\n\n**Summary & Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n*   **Task Scheduler Involvement:**  A strong indicator of persistence and scheduled execution.\n*   **`Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`**:  Clear evidence of cleanup activity. Investigate where `entrada_principal.zip` came from.\n*   **Temporary File Creation and Immediate Deletion:**  A common technique to avoid detection.\n*   **`entrada_principal.zip`**:  This ZIP file is a key item for investigation. Determine its origin, contents, and purpose.\n*   **`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`**: A temporary file that suggests the script checked PowerShell Execution Policies\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Investigate `entrada_principal.zip`**:  Determine its origin, contents, and purpose.  This is the most crucial step.  Was it manually downloaded? Did it arrive via email? Is it associated with a particular website?\n2.  **Examine Task Scheduler:**  Check the Task Scheduler to identify any suspicious tasks that might be executing the PowerShell script.  Pay attention to tasks with unusual triggers, hidden status, or names.\n3.  **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:**  Check the current PowerShell Execution Policy setting.  Ensure it is appropriately restrictive.\n4.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) \/ Antivirus Scans:** Run full system scans with up-to-date definitions.\n5.  **Monitor Registry:**  Examine the Registry for changes related to the script execution.\n6.  **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Analyze network traffic to see if any communication occurred during script execution."}
