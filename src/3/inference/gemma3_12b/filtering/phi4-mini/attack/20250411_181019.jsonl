The usage of `sc.exe` and attempts to create a service, followed by immediate deletion (`sc qc`), is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.  Multiple `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` registry events also contribute to the suspicion.  While some events are benign (notepad, calc), the combination of PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, and service manipulation warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
