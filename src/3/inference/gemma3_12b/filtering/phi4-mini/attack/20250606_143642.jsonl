{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data indicates a series of actions taken by malicious PowerShell scripts. Here's a breakdown of the events and the likely intent of the attacker:\n\n**1. Initial Attack Vector (Likely through a ZIP Archive - `entrada_principal.zip`)**\n\n* **`powershell.exe`:** Multiple instances of PowerShell are involved, indicating the core of the attack is executed by PowerShell.\n* **`entrada_principal.zip`:**  The later command to remove files suggests the initial attack likely came disguised within a ZIP archive named `entrada_principal.zip`.  The `.zip` extension is frequently used to trick users into thinking they're downloading something harmless.\n\n**2. DLL loading:**\n\n* Multiple DLL files were loaded during the PowerShell execution, primarily relating to .NET framework functionalities.\n\n**3. Stealth and Persistence Mechanisms**\n\n* **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`:**  The creation of `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` in the user's PowerShell startup folder is a classic persistence technique. This ensures the malicious PowerShell code runs automatically every time the user logs in or the system starts. It attempts to run scripts silently, without the user's knowledge.\n* **`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` file creation is critical:** The creation of this file indicates an attempt to establish persistence.  It signifies that the attacker is aiming to execute malicious code repeatedly, even after the system is rebooted or the user logs out.\n\n**4. Data Removal (Cleanup)**\n\n* **`powershell.exe` & `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force`:** This is a key indicator of a cleanup operation. The attacker is deleting the initial ZIP archive (`entrada_principal.zip`) to cover their tracks and make it harder to trace the attack back to its source.  The `-Force` parameter means the deletion happens without prompting.\n\n**5. Registry Modification & Service Interaction**\n\n* **`svchost.exe` and `Registry value set`:**  Modification of the registry is a common tactic for attackers to change system behavior. The nature of the change is unknown without examining the specific registry keys being modified.\n* **`powershell.exe` & `Registry value set`:**  The attacker likely uses PowerShell to directly modify the registry.\n\n**Summary of Actions and Likely Intent:**\n\n1. **Infection:** The attacker used a malicious PowerShell script, likely disguised as a harmless file within a ZIP archive (`entrada_principal.zip`).\n2. **Persistence:** The PowerShell script created a startup profile to ensure its code is executed automatically upon login or system start.\n3. **Cleanup:** The script deleted the initial ZIP archive to remove evidence of the attack.\n4. **System Modification:**  The attacker is likely modifying system settings via registry changes.\n\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Scan for Malware:**  Immediately run a full system scan using an up-to-date antivirus\/antimalware solution.\n* **Examine Startup Profiles:** Investigate PowerShell startup profiles for suspicious scripts. (Run `Get-StartupProfile` in PowerShell as administrator).\n* **Check Scheduled Tasks:**  Review scheduled tasks for any unfamiliar entries.\n* **Review Registry:**  Carefully examine the registry for any unexpected changes.\n* **Block PowerShell Execution:** Restrict PowerShell execution from untrusted sources.\n* **Educate Users:**  Train users to be cautious about opening attachments from unknown senders.\n* **Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  EDR solutions can provide advanced threat detection and response capabilities.\n* **Monitor PowerShell Activity:** Implement monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious PowerShell activity."}
