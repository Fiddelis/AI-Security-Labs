The process name is git.exe every time, which makes sense because Git uses its own executable.

Each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the \"process\" field, every entry has \"git.exe\" as the name. Git is commonly used for version control and software development, so it's a legitimate process running on a system. No red flags there yet.\n\nThe \"winlog\" task indicates that each event is a \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So these are file creation events. It's normal for applications to create files during their operation, especially when setting up environments or updating dependencies.\n\nNow, examining the \"file\" paths, all of them point to files within the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp. Specifically, they're creating .d.ts files, which are TypeScript declaration files. This is typical behavior for tools like npm\/yarn when installing or updating packages. The node_modules folder is where Node.js libraries are stored, and cypress is a well-known testing framework.\n\nPutting this together: the same process (git.exe) is consistently creating files in a standard location associated with a development toolchain component. There's nothing unusual about file creation events in node_modules when installing or updating packages. Since all these activities align with expected behavior during software development, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole isn't indicative of suspicious activity.

Each one has a process named \"git.exe\", a Windows log task indicating a file was created, and the path to the file.\n\nFirst off, all these events are coming from the same process: git.exe. That suggests it's part of a Git operation. The files being created are in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp. These look like TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts), which makes sense because node_modules often contains such files for type definitions.\n\nThe paths are sequential and related to Lodash utility functions, like nthArg.d.ts, omit.d.ts, etc. This pattern indicates that Git is cloning or updating a repository and creating these files as part of the process. It's pretty standard when dealing with Node.js modules and version control systems like Git.\n\nNow, considering security, I need to check if this activity is unusual. Since all events are from the same source (git.exe) creating predictable files in a typical project structure, it doesn't raise any red flags. There's no indication of file creation in system directories or elsewhere that might suggest malicious activity. No unexpected process names or file paths outside the norm for development environments.\n\nSo, overall, this batch looks like normal Git operations during development.

Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing that stands out is that every single event has the same process name: git.exe. That's interesting because it suggests that these are all related to the Git version control system.\n\nThe task field in each event says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which tells me that each of these events is a file creation event. So, Git is creating files somewhere on the system. The file paths provided are all within the node_modules folder under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/. I'm pretty familiar with Node.js and npm, so I know that node_modules is where third-party packages are stored.\n\nLooking at the specific file names like set.d.ts, slice.d.ts, some.d.ts, etc., these are TypeScript definition files. Git cloning or installing dependencies would typically create a lot of files in one go, especially if it's part of a project setup. The fact that all these events are happening together makes sense if someone is setting up or updating their development environment.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of malicious activity: Git itself isn't inherently malicious, but attackers might use it for certain types of attacks, like supply chain attacks where malicious code is included in packages. However, in this case, the files being created are standard TypeScript definitions from a package called cypress. Cypress is a well-known testing framework, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThe path structure also looks legitimate. The user's directory is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software, which seems to be an educational or project-specific folder. This isn't indicative of anything suspicious; it's more like someone working on a software quality course or project.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency and volume of these events. Ten plus file creation events in quick succession from Git could indicate normal development activity. If this were part of a larger sequence of unusual activities, it might be more concerning, but isolated to these file creations, it doesn't seem problematic.\n\nI also think about whether the presence of .d.ts files is significant. These are declaration files that provide type information for TypeScript. They're commonly downloaded when using npm packages with TypeScript support, so their creation is a standard part of the setup process.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), there's nothing here like unusual file hashes, execution of scripts, or access to restricted areas. It's all about creating files in a typical development directory structure.\n\nFurthermore, considering the context provided by the file paths, it's clear that this is related to software development. The user is likely working on a project that uses Cypress for testing, which explains why Git is involved in creating these files.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process (git.exe), multiple file creation events in a standard node_modules directory, related to a legitimate package (cypress). This doesn't indicate any malicious behavior. It's more about the user setting up or updating their development environment with Cypress and its dependencies.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal file creation activities by Git during development setup, indicating legitimate software development work.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The \"file\" path is consistently pointing to various .d.ts files within the node_modules directory of cypress, specifically under lodash\/fp.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal here. git.exe is commonly used for version control. It's possible that someone is cloning a repository or running some script that touches multiple files.

Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications and often includes type definitions for various libraries like lodash.

There's no indication of unauthorized access or malicious activity here. It seems more like standard file operations during development work.\n\nI should also think about whether multiple FileCreate events are typical. In development environments, especially when using tools like npm or yarn, it's common to have several files created or modified during installations or script runs. Git could be part of a CI\/CD pipeline, where multiple files are being processed as part of a build step.\n\nAnother angle is checking if these file paths contain any suspicious elements. The path includes \"inatel\" which might refer to a specific course or institution's directory structure, and the module names like lodash and cypress don't indicate anything malicious.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'd say there's low suspicion here because the activities are within expected bounds for development environments using common tools and libraries.
