Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The command line in one event shows it's downloading a script from GitHub. That URL seems suspicious because GitHub isn't typically where malicious scripts are hosted directly; more often, they're on obscure or compromised sites.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is accessing several files and registry values, which might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. The file deletions and creation of startup profile data could be efforts to clean traces or establish persistence. The use of 'whoami.exe' twice stands out as it's often used by attackers to gather user information.\n\nOther processes like svchost.exe and sppsvc.exe show normal activity, but combined with the powershell behavior, they might not raise flags on their own but contribute to a concerning pattern when viewed together.\n\nConsidering all these points, there are multiple red flags pointing towards potential malicious activities. The confidence level is high because of the combination of powershell script execution from an external source and file deletions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including downloading a script from GitHub, file deletions, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing some system log event.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the processes are powershell.exe. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it appears multiple times in different events makes me think there's something to look into.\n\nLooking at the details, I see tasks like 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', 'Image loaded', and even specific file operations like creating and deleting files. For example, one event shows a file being created in the Temp directory with a name __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. That looks suspicious because it's a PowerShell script file being created temporarily, which might be part of executing malicious code.\n\nAnother point is that some events mention files loaded from Windows Defender Platform directories, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. While these are legitimate files, the context in which they're loaded could be suspicious if paired with other activities. However, I'm not too concerned about this unless there's more indication of misuse.\n\nThen there's an event where a new process is created with a specific command line that uses iex to execute code from a URL. The URL points to raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/..., which seems like it's fetching a PowerShell script. This is concerning because WinPwn is known as a tool used in ransomware attacks, and downloading such scripts without proper justification could be malicious.\n\nAdditionally, the same command line appears multiple times across different events. This repetition suggests that the same malicious script is being executed repeatedly, which is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. Malicious actors often run their payloads multiple times to ensure they execute successfully or to carry out different parts of an attack.\n\nI also notice the use of WebClient to download the script. Using WebClient can be a way for attackers to avoid detection by some security tools because it's a common system process, making it harder to block without specific rules.\n\nThe events show both file creation and deletion of that temporary PowerShell script. This could be part of an attempt to clean up evidence after execution or test if the script is allowed to run. Either way, it's not normal behavior for legitimate scripts.\n\nTaking all these points together: multiple powershell.exe instances, registry modifications, loading of known malicious scripts from GitHub, repeated attempts to execute the same command—these are all signs that this batch of events is highly indicative of a security incident. The confidence level is high because each individual event contributes to a pattern that suggests malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing resources, creating temporary files, and executing scripts downloaded from a known malicious repository indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a batch of system log events, each in JSONL format. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with specific command lines. The first set of events (lines 1-7) have a command line that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository. This script is named WinPwn.ps1, which sounds suspicious because 'pwnd' often relates to exploitation or attacks. Also, the parameters used are '-noninteractive -consoleoutput', which might indicate an attempt to run it without user interaction and suppress output.\n\nThen, there's another set of events (lines 8-14) where PowerShell is creating a new drive with New-PSDrive, targeting '\\\\Target\\\\C$'. This looks like a way to access remote drives or perhaps lateral movement within a network. Using such commands could be part of an attack to gain control over other machines.\n\nThe last set of events (lines 15-23) have no process information but log \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks. These are concerning because executing remote commands can be a sign of command-line attacks or remote execution vulnerabilities being exploited.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with these specific commands is a red flag. The download of an external script and attempts to access remote drives suggest potential malicious activity. Additionally, the variety of log tasks (Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Execute Remote Command) indicates different stages of what might be a coordinated attack.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show PowerShell executing commands that download an external script (WinPwn.ps1) and attempt remote drive access, which are indicators of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. Each one is in JSONL format, so four separate lines each with a single JSON object.\n\nEach event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. Let's break them down.\n\nThe \"process\" field is always null in these events. That doesn't give me much to go on—no information about the running processes or executables involved.\n\nNext, looking at the \"winlog\" field, each one has a task value of 'Execute a Remote Command'. This suggests that there's an attempt to run commands remotely on the system. The repetition of this event four times is notable. It might indicate either multiple legitimate remote executions, perhaps from a script or scheduled tasks, or it could be signs of malicious activity like repeated command execution attempts as part of a larger attack.\n\nSince the \"file\" field is also null in each case, there's no file path or name to analyze for potential malware signatures or indicators. Without this context, I can't determine if specific files are being accessed or modified during these remote commands.\n\nConsidering all four events together, the repeated occurrence of attempting to execute remote commands could be concerning. However, without additional information about what exactly is being executed or any associated file operations, it's hard to definitively classify this as malicious. It might just be a legitimate batch process or script running multiple times.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that there are four consecutive events with the same task and no other context could raise eyebrows. Attackers often use remote command execution for lateral movement or to execute payloads on compromised systems. The lack of file information leaves me uncertain about the exact nature of these commands.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because repeated remote command attempts without additional context can be a red flag, but I'm not entirely sure. There's some ambiguity here without more data points.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate repeated attempts to execute remote commands, which may suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
