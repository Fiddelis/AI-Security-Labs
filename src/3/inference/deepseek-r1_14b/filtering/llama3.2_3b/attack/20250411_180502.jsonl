Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a Chrome.exe process with a network connection detected. That could be normal browsing activity, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries from powershell.exe. The command lines show that it's starting processes with paths like \"C:\\pacote_comum\\objeto_secundario\\..\\\" which translates to \"..\" indicating moving up a directory. This could be an attempt to execute scripts from different locations, which is concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities.\n\nThen there are several Registry value sets by both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome might update registry settings normally, the combination with powershell's activity raises flags. Also, powershell.exe accessing images like mscoree.dll and clr.dll isn't typical unless it's part of script execution or loading libraries for malicious purposes.\n\nI notice a file being created and then deleted in the Temp directory by powershell.exe. This is a common tactic to avoid detection; creating temporary files that are quickly deleted suggests something might be hiding there, possibly malicious code.\n\nThere are multiple events where PowerShell starts processes with .bat files. These scripts could be executing commands or downloading additional content. The paths seem arbitrary and spread across different directories, which doesn't align with standard legitimate script execution practices.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks from powershell.exe might indicate it's trying to load modules or components, possibly for lateral movement or to establish persistence in the system.\n\nConsidering all these events together: unusual file operations, multiple registry changes by non-standard processes, network activity, and repeated attempts to execute scripts from various locations. These collectively suggest a potential malicious campaign using PowerShell as a tool, which is commonly used in attacks due to its built-in administrative capabilities.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.85 that this batch shows signs of malicious behavior, making it definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are performing file operations and registry modifications, which may indicate suspicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the events involve different processes: powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a vector for attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. Chrome is usually just a browser, so any malicious activity there might not be as common unless there's some kind of extension or exploit.\n\nLooking at the first event, powershell.exe loaded urlmon.dll. URLMON.DLL is part of Windows and handles URL processing. That seems normal. But sometimes, attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. So I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe second event with powershell.exe shows a registry value being set. Registry modifications can be indicators of both benign activity (like installing software) or malicious behavior. I don't have enough context here to know if this is normal for the user's environment, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process running a batch script. Batch scripts are common in Windows for automation. The path seems legitimate, pointing to C:\\entrada_ativo\\..., which might be a standard folder for scripts. But without knowing what the script does, I can't say for sure. It could be benign or part of an attack.\n\nThen, another powershell.exe event creates a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This is where PowerShell stores non-interactive profile data. That sounds legitimate if it's related to user profiles or configuration, but again, without more info, I'm cautious.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events: multiple registry writes. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions. If these are standard updates, they're not suspicious. However, frequent writes could indicate something malicious, like a persistence mechanism or extension installation. But since there's no other indication of unusual behavior from Chrome, I might lean towards it being normal.\n\nThe last event again involves powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder named elemento_base.txt. It's a bit odd to see powershell creating files in user folders. Legitimate scripts might do this, but it's more common for malicious actors to create such files, perhaps dropping payloads or configuration files here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple events involving powershell.exe performing actions that could be both legitimate and malicious. The combination of registry writes, file creations, especially outside standard directories like the Startup folder and Downloads, raises some red flags. Chrome's activity seems less concerning but still part of a pattern where multiple processes are showing signs of possible manipulation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this indicates an active attack or just some automated tasks, but given the number of potentially suspicious actions from powershell.exe and the fact that they're spread across different files and registry entries, it's worth investigating. My confidence isn't super high because each individual event could be benign, but collectively, there's enough to suggest possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe performing actions that may indicate potential malicious behavior, including registry modifications and file creation in non-standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
