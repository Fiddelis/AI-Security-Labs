Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I see a process named calc.exe loading an image, which seems normal since it's a calculator app. Then Calculator.exe does the same with urlmon.dll—another standard Windows file. Next up is svchost.exe setting a registry value; that's not unusual because svchost is part of legitimate services.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a common tool to check user information, so it might be used by scripts or users checking their permissions. It doesn't seem suspicious on its own unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe also sets a registry value—this is related to Windows apps and is typically benign. The first mention of powershell.exe accessing a process makes me pause because PowerShell can be used for both good and bad things. But looking at the context, there's no indication of malicious commands yet. Then cmd.exe runs some command to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems like it could be legitimate if someone is cleaning up old processes or running automated scripts.\n\nWMIC.exe appears a few times, which I know can be used for remote management but has been involved in attacks because it allows command execution. The command line shows deleting notepad.exe processes, which might be part of a script to remove something or prevent logging. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are more instances where chrome.exe is accessing registry values—nothing out of the ordinary there since Chrome interacts with Windows settings. Another WMIC.exe event loads an MpOAV.dll file, which sounds like it's related to antivirus software, so that might be normal if it's part of Windows Defender updates.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe entries show process access and registry changes. While PowerShell can execute commands, the events here don't provide specific actions, just that they accessed or modified something. This could be for legitimate administration tasks.\n\nI also see cmd.exe copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. SETHC is a system tool related to screen savers, and replacing it might be part of legitimate updates or malicious activities. If this is an attempt to replace a system binary, it could be suspicious, but without seeing the actual file content, I can't be sure.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. Deleting tasks is normal for cleaning up or changing system behavior, so unless it's part of a persistence mechanism, it might not be an issue.\n\nThe events repeat with whoami.exe and powershell.exe being called again, which could indicate repeated attempts to check user permissions or run scripts. However, without knowing the frequency or the user context, it's hard to judge if this is unusual.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of legitimate tools like cmd.exe, PowerShell, and WMIC.exe performing operations that can be part of normal system administration or malicious activities. The repeated use of these tools might raise some flags, especially the deletion of processes and files. However, without clear indicators of compromise (like known malicious file hashes or specific commands), it's hard to definitively say this is an attack.\n\nI'm on the fence because while there are red flags like replacing system files and deleting tasks, it could also be a legitimate admin script or a user running these commands unknowingly. The confidence level isn't super high without more context, but the combination does have enough concerning activities to merit some attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving potentially malicious activities such as file replacements and process deletions suggest possible system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can execute commands. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could be a red flag, especially if the command lines aren't standard.\n\nLooking at some of these events: there's a whoami.exe process being created with the command line pointing to system32. Whoami is usually innocent, but if it's called from an unexpected place or without proper context, it might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThen there are multiple instances where cmd.exe is being run with \"\/c\" as a parameter. The \/c option tells cmd to execute the command and then terminate. This can be a way to hide commands in the process tree because after execution, the parent cmd process dies, making it harder to trace. If these cmd processes are running arbitrary scripts or commands without clear business justification, that could be concerning.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe is involved with a registry value set. Conhost is often used by attackers to host malicious payloads in a hidden manner. It's known for being part of some exploit kits and can be indicative of remote access tools.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1). Creating temporary scripts can be part of testing permissions or executing malicious code. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection, as deleting evidence could cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where the command line for powershell.exe is \"& {}\", which doesn't execute any script but just returns control. This can be a way to check if PowerShell is available or to test execution without logging much activity, which is common in reconnoissance phases of an attack.\n\nPutting this all together, it seems like there are several signs that could indicate malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially suspicious command lines, the use of cmd.exe for executing commands, the involvement of conhost.exe, and the creation\/deletion of a script file—all these factors make me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n\nHowever, I should consider if any of these actions are benign. For example, legitimate system administrators might run whoami.exe or powershell scripts for troubleshooting. But the combination—especially the multiple accesses to PowerShell, hidden processes via cmd.exe and conhost, and the temporary script file—does raise eyebrows.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the batch is definitely worth investigating because the pattern of events suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated PowerShell access, cmd.exe execution with '\/c' parameter, conhost.exe registry interaction, and temporary script creation\/deletion indicative of possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where the process is `whoami.exe`. This is a common system utility used to display user information. Typically, this isn't suspicious on its own unless it's being run in an unexpected context or repeatedly. However, looking at the events, there's only one instance of whoami.exe starting. Not sure if that's concerning yet.\n\nNext, I see multiple entries with `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused for malicious activities. The command lines in these events are a bit complex. They involve checking the existence of certain files using `Test-Path` and exiting based on whether those files exist. This behavior could be part of legitimate script execution or something more nefarious, like testing if specific files are present before proceeding with an attack.\n\nLooking at the event types, there's a mix of process creations, provider lifecycle events, file deletions, registry changes, pipe creation, and image loading. The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`) caught my attention because deleting scripts can sometimes be part of an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where a new file is created in the StartupProfileData directory. This could indicate persistence mechanisms, as attackers might place scripts here to run on startup.\n\nThe command lines in some events are obfuscated or use complex paths with backslashes and multiple levels. Obfuscation can be a red flag for malicious activities because attackers often try to hide their commands.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n- Multiple PowerShell processes running with varied command-line arguments.\n- Attempts to check file existence which could be part of payload deployment checks.\n- Deletion of temporary scripts, possibly to avoid detection.\n- Registry modifications and pipe creation, which can be used for communication between malicious processes or persistence.\n\nThe combination suggests possible malicious activity. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the pattern across all events raises concerns. The high number of PowerShell executions with varied commands, file deletions, and attempts to create new files could indicate a script testing environment or payload delivery.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with complex command lines, deletion of temporary scripts, registry modifications, and file creations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command-line execution and can be associated with malicious activities. However, it's also commonly used by admins for legitimate tasks, so we need to dig deeper.\n\nLooking at each event:\n1. The first few entries show powershell.exe setting registry values and loading various image files (DLLs). This might be normal if it's part of a script or legitimate process, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n2. Then there are several events where powershell.exe is creating new items (files) in different paths using commands like New-Item and Set-Content. The file paths look a bit unusual with multiple backslashes and components that seem generic but might be trying to avoid detection. For example, \"C:\\\\registro_geral\\\\componente_ativo\\\\..\\\\componente_geral\\\\elemento_ativo_script.bat\" – the use of \"..\\\\\" suggests they're navigating up directories, which could be an attempt to write files in system directories or areas with less scrutiny.\n3. The command lines are lengthy and repetitive, each creating a new batch file. This pattern is suspicious because it seems automated and possibly part of a script that's dropping malicious scripts or tools onto the system.\n4. Some events show loading of DLLs which could be normal, but combined with the file creation activities, it raises concerns about potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n5. There are also events related to image loads and process access, which could indicate injection or other process-related malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these together, the repetitive use of powershell.exe to create files in various locations is a strong indicator that this might be part of a script designed to spread across the system or establish persistence. The file paths used don't seem to align with standard user directories or common application data folders, which makes me lean towards considering this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are red flags, it's possible that these actions could be from a legitimate script or administrative task. However, the combination of multiple file creations, unusual paths, and powershell.exe usage increases the likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating files in various locations using potentially suspicious paths.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are PowerShell executions. The command lines look a bit suspicious because they're checking for the existence of certain .bat files in various paths. Each path seems to be different, but they all follow a pattern like \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao..\". This makes me think that someone is trying to check if specific scripts or batch files exist on the system.\n\nIn the first few events, the task under winlog is 'Provider Lifecycle'. That doesn't ring any immediate bells as malicious, but I'm not entirely sure. Then there's an event where a file is deleted: it's a PowerShell script in the Temp folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. Deleting a script could be part of cleaning up after execution, which might be normal, but if this script was doing something malicious before deletion, that's concerning.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory, which I assume is related to log shipping or monitoring tools. That seems benign unless it's being used for something else. There's also an event where PowerShell creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. This could be part of user profile initialization but might also be a way to load malicious scripts at startup.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe execution, which is often used by attackers to check the current user context. It's a common reconnaissance tool, so that stands out as potentially suspicious. If this was run without any reason or in an unexpected context, it could indicate an attacker exploring the system.\n\nLooking back at the PowerShell commands, they all seem to exit with 0 if the file exists and 1 otherwise. This repetitive check might be part of a script testing for specific files before proceeding. The paths mentioned are varied but have a logical structure, which makes me think this is automated behavior—maybe an installer or some deployment script.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple PowerShell instances are running similar checks could indicate either normal administrative activity or something more nefarious like a script trying to avoid detection by checking for certain files before acting. The deletion of the script file and the whoami.exe execution add weight to the idea that this batch is worth investigating further.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags: multiple PowerShell executions with similar patterns, a file deletion, and the use of whoami.exe. While some events could be benign, the combination suggests potential malicious activity or at least something out of the ordinary that needs closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potentially suspicious file checks, deletion of a script file, and use of whoami.exe indicate possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, I'm seeing multiple PowerShell processes being created and accessed, along with some file operations and registry changes. The command lines in the PowerShell executions are checking for the existence of specific files, which is interesting. There's also a cmd.exe process that exits based on the presence of a text file.\n\nHmm, while these actions aren't necessarily malicious on their own, the repeated use of PowerShell with conditional checks might indicate some automated script testing different paths. The use of multiple processes and file operations could be part of an attempt to establish persistence or gather information. I'm also noticing that there are two instances where whoami.exe is run, which can be used to get system info—maybe for reconnaissance.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't super high because these activities could be legitimate scripts running checks. But the combination of PowerShell commands with conditional exits and file deletions raises some red flags.

Let me go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several events where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check the existence of specific files. The commands use `Test-Path` to see if certain .cs or .ps1 files exist in various directories. If the file exists, it exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This kind of behavior could be part of a script checking prerequisites, but I'm noticing that multiple events are doing similar checks on different paths. That repetition might indicate some automated process or perhaps an attempt to verify certain files across several locations.\n\nThen, there's an event where a file is created in the user's AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. Creating a file here could be part of initializing PowerShell profiles, but it's something that might be monitored for unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. These are legitimate in many cases, but sometimes attackers use these to load malicious code or hide within normal processes.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 in the Temp directory. This file name is suspiciously long and random-looking, which might be a technique to avoid detection by security tools. Temporary script files can be used to execute malicious code temporarily to evade analysis.\n\nAdditionally, there are Pipe Created events from powershell.exe. These could be for legitimate inter-process communication but can also be used by malware to communicate with other processes or establish command-and-control channels.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated file checks across different paths might indicate a script that's trying to locate and execute additional malicious scripts (like Get-Keystrokes.ps1), which are often used for keylogging or stealing input. The creation of temporary files and the use of PowerShell with such specific command lines could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nI'm also considering whether these events might be part of a legitimate process, like a script that's setting up configurations across multiple directories. However, the combination of checking for non-existent scripts, creating temp files, loading unusual DLLs, and repeated checks on various paths makes me lean towards this being suspicious. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present, even if individually some might not be alarming.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions check for files named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 across various paths, and a suspiciously named temp script is created.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are related to PowerShell and other system processes like whoami.exe and calc.exe. The tasks include things like process creation, file operations, and registry changes.\n\nI notice several instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve scripts or commands like ls, get-childitem, and gci. These seem to be legitimate PowerShell commands used for directory listing and similar tasks, which are common in system administration.\n\nThere's also a mention of a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of the log management setup. The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file might be normal as part of script execution cleanup.\n\nHowever, one event stands out: the initial powershell.exe process where it checks if Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists and exits with 0 or 1. This script name sounds suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malicious activities. If this script were to actually log keystrokes without proper authorization, that would be a red flag.\n\nBut looking deeper, the other events don't show any signs of malicious behavior beyond that initial check. There's no evidence of file creation or deletion outside normal operations, no unusual registry modifications beyond what's seen in system processes, and no network activities mentioned.\n\nSince most events are standard system behaviors and only one event hints at a potentially malicious script, but without further execution logs showing the script's actions, I can't confidently conclude it's an attack. Therefore, while there's some cause for concern, the batch as a whole doesn't strongly indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events related to PowerShell execution and file operations that may indicate potential malicious behavior, such as checking for a suspicious script and process creation patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That looks like normal PowerShell activity, maybe some script running or configuration being saved. Not too suspicious yet.\n\nSecond event: Still powershell.exe, but this time it's setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate scripts, but they could also be indicators of malicious activity. I should keep an eye on how many times this happens and the context.\n\nThird event: conhost.exe is another process that caught my attention. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools like cmd or powershell, acting as a host for them. If it's modifying registry values, maybe it's part of some script execution. I need to see if there are other events tied to this.\n\nFourth event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory seems odd. Winlogbeat is likely an agent for log management, so why would it create a new .yml file? Maybe an update or configuration change? Not sure yet, but it's something to note.\n\nFifth and sixth events again involve powershell.exe: one setting another registry value and another accessing a process. The multiple registry writes from PowerShell might be a red flag. Attackers often use these methods to persistence or modify system settings. Plus, the combination of these activities across different processes could indicate a chain of actions that are not typical user behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of unusual activity: multiple registry modifications by powershell.exe, conhost.exe doing similar actions, and winlogbeat creating unexpected files. These could be signs of malicious scripts running, potentially setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations to hide their tracks. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions can be legitimate, but the clustering around PowerShell and registry changes is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe modifying registry values and file creation by winlogbeat.exe in an unexpected location suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
