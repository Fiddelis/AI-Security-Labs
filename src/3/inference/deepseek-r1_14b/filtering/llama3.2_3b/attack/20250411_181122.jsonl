{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with command lines that include searching for patterns related to passwords. For example, the command line has \"findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password\". This looks suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and can be a tool for malicious activities. Searching for keywords like 'pass' in various file types might indicate an attempt to gather sensitive information.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that there are repeated events where powershell.exe creates temporary files, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1, which is then deleted shortly after. This behavior could be a sign of script execution or testing policy bypasses. Temporary script creation and deletion can be tactics used by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where svchost.exe writes to the registry. SvcHost is a legitimate process but is often exploited by malware because it's part of Windows services. Malicious actors might create or modify registry entries using svchost.exe as a means to persistence or execute malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll could be normal, but sometimes attackers use seemingly benign processes to hide their activities. However, in this case, since the file path seems legitimate and no other indicators of compromise are present for calc.exe, it might not be as concerning on its own.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is running without any suspicious command-line arguments. It's a common utility used to check user information, so unless there's evidence of misuse or privilege escalation, this event doesn't raise red flags.\n\nThere are also events related to file creation and deletion by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely part of log management software (like the Elastic Winlogbeat). This isn't unusual and probably not malicious in nature.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances with password-related commands, temporary script file creation and deletion, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and other potentially suspicious activities suggests a possible security incident. These behaviors could indicate an active attack or at least an attempt to gather information or establish persistence on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious powershell.exe processes searching for passwords, temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: OfficeClickToRun.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal since many apps do that.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command with findstr searching for 'pass' in various file types. Searching for passwords isn't inherently bad, but could be suspicious depending on context. However, it's not clear if this is malicious or just a script.\n\nThen, multiple Chrome events—DNS queries, registry changes, loading DLLs like MpOAV.dll, and network connections. These are standard activities for a browser, especially Windows Defender components, so probably benign.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat creating a file. That's expected if it's running as part of monitoring setup.\n\nA whoami.exe execution is common but could be used for privilege escalation. However, without other signs, it's not conclusive.\n\nMultiple cmd.exe commands deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks and powershell.exe accessing processes. Deleting tasks can indicate attempts to remove persistence mechanisms, which might be malicious. Especially with the specific task names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" suggests potential persistence removal.\n\nWMIC.exe command trying to delete notepad.exe process could be an attempt to hide activity or prevent logging, which is a red flag for malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all together: suspicious PowerShell commands searching for passwords, deletion of scheduled tasks, and WMIC process termination are concerning. These actions can be signs of malware trying to clean up traces or disable monitoring tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes potentially malicious activities such as deleting scheduled tasks and attempting to terminate processes, which could indicate an attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst event: WMIC.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory. That seems suspicious because WMIC is often used for remote attacks, but the file path looks legitimate as it's part of Windows Defender. Maybe not malicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nNext, cmd.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of normal operations, but I should check if these are in unusual places or happening too frequently.\n\nThen there's a command to delete a user account using cmd.exe. The command line shows \"\/del\" being used on a specific user. Deleting users is something an admin would do, but without context, it might be malicious activity trying to cover tracks.\n\nPowershell.exe accessed next. Powershell is powerful and often abused by attackers. Just accessing it isn't bad, but I should see if there are any suspicious commands or script executions.\n\nAnother cmd.exe setting registry values. This repetition makes me think something's off—maybe the system is being configured for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThen net.exe deleting another user account. Similar to before, this could be legitimate admin work or part of an attack.\n\nNet1.exe used to delete a user as well. I'm not familiar with net1.exe; maybe it's a variant or typo of net.exe? Either way, multiple deletions are concerning.\n\nPowershell accessed again—same as above, high privilege tool.\n\nWhoami.exe ran without any arguments. It's usually used to check permissions, but in the context of other events, could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nAnother Powershell access—again, nothing wrong on its own, but combined with others...\n\nThere are a couple more events where cmd.exe sets registry values and then sc.exe deleting a service. Deleting services can disrupt system operations, which might be malicious.\n\nThen cmd.exe again with a long command line to delete temp files. This could be part of cleaning up after an attack or legitimate cleanup, but the specific naming of the files (like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\") seems suspiciously specific and perhaps linked to some activity.\n\nConhost.exe also set a registry value—conhost is often used in command injection attacks. That's another red flag.\n\nWhoami.exe ran again; maybe checking user details multiple times.\n\nLastly, cmd.exe running a complex command with del and redirection. The script deletes two files in the temp directory, which could be trying to remove evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of deleting user accounts (Admin-suffixed names) using various tools like net.exe, net1.exe, sc.exe. Powershell and whoami being accessed several times—possibly for elevation or info gathering. WMIC loading a DLL (maybe dropping malware). cmd.exe used to delete files and set registry values, which could be creating persistence mechanisms or cleaning up traces.\n\nI'm leaning towards this batch being interesting because the combination of account deletions, service removals, Powershell usage, and file deletions suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of different tools to perform similar actions also raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple attempts to delete user accounts using various commands, including net.exe, net1.exe, and sc.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these together and decide whether they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows that cmd.exe deleted a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. That caught my attention because deleting files can be part of malicious activity, especially if the file is something suspicious like an executable.\n\nLooking at the next few events, there are several instances where whoami.exe and powershell.exe are being executed. Whoami.exe is often used to get user information, which in itself isn't necessarily bad, but it could be part of a larger attack. The command lines seem normal for these utilities, so I'm not sure if that's concerning yet.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with different tasks like Process Create, Process Access, Image Load, and File operations. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in cmdlets that can do various things, including executing scripts and accessing system resources. The fact that there are so many events related to powershell might be a red flag. Also, some of the file paths created or deleted by PowerShell look temporary, which is common in malicious scripts trying to avoid detection.\n\nI notice there's a file creation and deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Temporary files are often used in attacks to execute code without leaving long-term traces. The fact that this file was created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to hide activity, which is suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender Platform. While Defender's components are legitimate, attackers sometimes abuse them, so I have to consider the context here. The repeated use of powershell.exe and multiple instances of it could suggest a script running in a loop or part of a larger campaign.\n\nThe events also show registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications can be malicious, especially if they're trying to maintain persistence or change system configurations without user consent.\n\nPutting it all together: cmd.exe deleting an executable, multiple whoami executions (possibly checking permissions), extensive PowerShell usage with file creation\/deletion, and registry changes. This combination looks like a potential attack vector where an adversary is using legitimate tools in a way that's not typical for normal operations. The repetitive use of these utilities and the temporary files involved make me lean towards this being suspicious.\n\nHowever, I'm considering whether these actions could be part of regular system administration or script execution by authorized users. But given the specific file deletions, multiple powershell instances, and the creation of potentially malicious scripts, it's more likely than not that this batch indicates malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving suspicious file operations by cmd.exe and PowerShell, including deletion of an executable file and creation\/deletion of a temporary script file. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. So I see multiple entries here. First, there are two process events for calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Then a file creation by winlogbeat.exe which is likely part of log management. Next, powershell.exe accessing something without a file path. And several chrome.exe instances with DNS queries and network connections.\n\nHmm, I need to determine if this batch as a whole is interesting or not. Let me look for any signs of malicious activity. The calc.exe process loading urlmon.dll might seem suspicious because sometimes malware uses legitimate processes. But wait, Calculator.exe also loads the same file. Both are standard system files, so maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nWinlogbeat creating a config file is expected since it's log management software; nothing unusual there. Powershell accessing something without a file path could be concerning because powershell is often used for scripting and can execute malicious commands. But I don't see any other events indicating suspicious activity from powershell, like writes to files or network traffic.\n\nThe multiple chrome.exe DNS queries and connections are typical for a browser, especially when loading pages. Nothing stands out as malicious in those entries.\n\nPutting it all together: most events look normal. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe activities aren't unusual, same with the chrome.exe network actions. Powershell's activity is slight red flag but not enough to conclude anything without more context. Overall, no clear indicators of malicious behavior across all events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes and activities, including legitimate file operations and network connections from common applications like Chrome and Calculator.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
