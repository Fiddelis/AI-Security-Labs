Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: it's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard system command used to find out user information. Not too suspicious on its own, but I should keep an eye out in case there are other events related to privilege escalation or info gathering.\n\nThe next two events involve svchost.exe and powershell.exe both setting registry values. Svchost is a legitimate process, often used by services, so that's not alarming. Powershell is commonly used for scripting but can also be abused. However, without more context on the commands run, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe third event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that includes adding a type and creating a bitmap to save an image. This looks like it's taking a screenshot and saving it as a PNG in the TEMP directory. Screenshotting can be part of legitimate activities or could indicate data theft if combined with other actions.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads images, specifically mscoree.dll and others related to .NET framework. These are standard libraries that PowerShell uses, so this isn't concerning on its own but shows the script is using these components for functionality.\n\nThe following events have similar command lines as before, taking screenshots and saving them under different filenames like tarefa_comum.png, componente_principal.png, etc. This repetitive behavior of capturing screenshots might be part of a data collection routine or surveillance tool, which could be malicious if not authorized.\n\nAlso, the tasks associated with these events vary between Process Create, Registry changes, Image Load, and Provider Lifecycle. While some are normal operations for scripts, others like registry modifications can be indicators of configuration changes that may be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of powershell.exe executing multiple times with specific commands to take screenshots and interact with the system. This behavior could indicate malicious activity such as screen recording or data exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, the repeated use of Add-Type suggests they're loading custom assemblies, which can be a red flag for potential exploit code.\n\nI'm not seeing any direct evidence of malicious actions beyond these indicators, but the combination of registry modifications and screenshotting is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence level isn't extremely high, maybe around 0.7, because while the behavior is suspicious, it's possible that a legitimate script could perform such actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands to take screenshots and save them to the TEMP directory, combined with registry modifications. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity or unauthorized system interaction.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, the initial events show powershell.exe being used with command lines that involve capturing the screen. The commands use System.Windows.Forms to take a screenshot and save it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. This is a bit concerning because taking screenshots can be part of malicious activities like screen scraping or surveillance. Also, using Powershell for such tasks might be an indicator of potential scripting abuse.\n\nNext, there's an event where a PowerShell script is deleted. The path mentioned is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1. The fact that it's in the Temp folder and has a somewhat random name suggests it might have been executed temporarily, which could be part of a malicious script's cleanup process to remove evidence.\n\nThen, there are events related to pipe creation by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for interprocess communication, but in the context of Powershell, this could indicate command execution or remote operations. This adds another layer of concern because it might be a way to communicate with other processes or systems.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where a file is created related to the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. While legitimate scripts can create such files, the non-interactive nature might mean it's part of an automated process, possibly malicious in intent.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so this could be normal behavior if it's being used to collect logs. However, without more context, I'm cautious because sometimes attackers use such tools for data exfiltration.\n\nThere are also registry modifications by ApplicationFrameHost.exe and chrome.exe. While Chrome accessing AMSI DLL might be normal for anti-malware scanning, unexpected registry changes can indicate malicious activity trying to persistence or modify system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated Powershell activities with screenshot captures, script deletion, pipe creation, and file operations in TEMP directories suggest possible malicious behavior. The combination of these events is more concerning than isolated ones because they show a pattern that could be part of an attack chainâ€”reconnaissance (screenshot), execution (script), cleanup (deletion), and possibly persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile there's no concrete evidence, the indicators point towards potential malicious activities. The confidence isn't very high because some events might be legitimate, but the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes captured screenshots and executed scripts in TEMP directory, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
