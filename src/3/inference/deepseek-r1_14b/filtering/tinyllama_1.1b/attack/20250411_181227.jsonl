{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe with a command line that looks suspicious. The command lines all seem similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. They're trying to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This looks like an attempt to create a persistent backdoor since it's scheduled to run on startup. That definitely raises red flags because creating tasks that run at logon can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing the registry and loading images, which could be part of how it's setting up the task or evading detection. Also, the creation of a temporary .ps1 file in the user's AppData folder suggests that PowerShell might have executed some script there. Temporary files created by scripts can sometimes indicate malicious activity, especially if they're not supposed to be there.\n\nHowever, there are also other events like chrome.exe creating a pipe and loading images, which are normal activities for a browser process. These don't seem suspicious on their own. But the combination of these with the PowerShell events makes me think that the unusual behavior is coming from PowerShell.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because multiple instances of potentially malicious activity (scheduling tasks with high privileges and creating temporary files) are present across several log entries. While some events might look normal, the overall pattern points to potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including registry modifications, image loading, and file creation suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's an event where powershell.exe is used to delete a file. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The file path seems suspicious too—it's in the Temp folder with a .ps1 extension, which is PowerShell script. So that might indicate some kind of scripting activity.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where 'Execute a Remote Command' is logged. This could mean someone is trying to run commands remotely on the system, which is potentially malicious. It's concerning because remote command execution can be used for things like lateral movement in an attack.\n\nI also see several instances where chrome.exe is modifying registry values. While Chrome sometimes does that during updates or configuration changes, multiple writes might indicate something more nefarious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nThere are some events related to scheduled tasks being created using powershell.exe again. The commands in the PowerShell script look like they're setting up scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. That's definitely suspicious because it suggests persistence mechanisms—meaning attackers might be trying to maintain access on reboot or user login.\n\nLooking further, there are entries from svchost.exe modifying registry values and WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. Svchost is a common process but can be used maliciously, especially when combined with other activities. The DLL being loaded could be part of normal operation, but the context here makes it worth noting.\n\nThere are also some file creation events for .yml and .txt files in user directories. These might be part of legitimate processes or tools logging data, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, if these files are created by powershell.exe or other scripts, they could be related to malicious activities.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file seems like it could be an agent running, possibly for log management. But in the context of other suspicious events, even this might warrant closer look.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern here with powershell.exe being used to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe at logon as administrators. This is textbook for persistence—attackers often set up such tasks to ensure they can regain access after a system restart or user logout. The multiple remote command executions and registry modifications by chrome.exe add to the concern, suggesting possible lateral movement or configuration changes to hide traces.\n\nThe fact that there are two separate powershell.exe instances setting up different scheduled tasks (estrutura_auxiliar and unidade_comum) makes me think this is part of a larger campaign. These names don't seem like standard system naming conventions, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nWhile some events might be legitimate (like chrome modifying registry or winlogbeat creating files), the combination with malicious-looking activities points towards potential compromise. The high number of remote command executions and the use of administrative privileges in scheduled tasks are particularly worrying signs.\n\nSo overall, this batch shows multiple indicators that could align with a cyberattack, especially focusing on persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation. Therefore, it's definitely interesting from an investigation standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell script execution to create scheduled tasks, remote command executions, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
