Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events where powershell.exe is involved. It starts with a task related to setting a registry value and then loading several image files. The paths look legitimate—like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are standard .NET framework components. So that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's an event about a pipe being created by powershell.exe. That could be normal if PowerShell is communicating with other processes or for remote commands, but it's also something to keep an eye on because pipes can sometimes be used for malicious communication.\n\nNext, I notice multiple Image Load events from different files related to the .NET framework and CLR. These seem pretty standard since PowerShell relies heavily on these libraries. But seeing so many in a short time might indicate some activity worth looking into, though it's not immediately clear if they're bad.\n\nThere are entries where services.exe and svchost.exe are setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process that hosts various Windows services, and services.exe is part of the service control manager. Both can legitimately make registry changes, so these events alone might not be suspicious unless there's an unusual pattern or access.\n\nLooking further down, there's a File Created event by powershell.exe in the user's AppData folder under Microsoft\/Windows\/PowerShell. That path seems related to PowerShell profiles. If this file is being created during a session, it could be normal, but if it's unexpected or modified after malicious activity, it might indicate something.\n\nThe last few events are File Created events for WindowsUpdate logs and more Registry value sets by svchost.exe. These don't stand out as unusual on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows a lot of legitimate-looking activities from PowerShell and system processes. While there's some activity that could be concerning, like pipe creation or file writes in user directories, nothing seems to cross into clear indicators of malicious behavior. However, the sheer number of events, especially around registry modifications and image loads, might warrant closer inspection. It's possible that a script or legitimate process is doing this, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nI think the classification should be INTERESTING because there are enough red flags to suggest potential malicious activity, but not enough concrete evidence to confidently label it as such. My confidence level is around 0.7 because while some events raise suspicions, they might also be explained by normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and image loads by powershell.exe and svchost.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, most of the events are coming from either setup.exe or svchost.exe. Setup.exe is a common installer, so that makes sense for creating files and registry entries during installation. But I'm noticing a lot of FileCreate tasks, ImageLoad, RegistryEvent changes, and PipeCreated events.\n\nLooking at the file paths created by setup.exe: they're all in the Microsoft Edge directory under Program Files (x86). The files include executables like msedge.exe and helper apps like notification_helper.exe. Also, there's a .bat file for showing third-party licenses, which seems legitimate.\n\nThen, there are events where svchost.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. Svchost is a known process that hosts system services, so it's normal for it to interact with the registry. But seeing several RegistryEvent entries might be worth looking into, as malicious software sometimes modifies the registry to persist or change configurations.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a pipe by setup.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, but if this is part of the Edge installation process, it's probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nI also notice that some events involve services.exe and setup.exe making changes to the registry. Again, during installations or updates, system services often need to modify the registry, so this isn't necessarily malicious unless there are other red flags.\n\nThe FileCreate events for Edge executables seem benign if it's a legitimate update or installation. The show_third_party_software_licenses.bat file is also something you'd expect from a proper software package wanting to display licensing information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, most of these activities align with what would happen during the installation or update process of Microsoft Edge. Setup.exe creating files and registry entries, svchost handling services, and pipes being created for communication—these are standard behaviors. I don't see any overt signs of malicious activity here, like creating hidden files, unusual file paths, or unexpected processes.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor such activities, especially since they involve system-level changes, the events as a whole don't raise any red flags that would classify them as interesting from a security standpoint. They seem consistent with normal software operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of standard file creation and registry modifications during Microsoft Edge installation, which is expected behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from 'setup.exe' setting registry values and creating pipes. That might be normal during setup processes, but repeated actions could indicate something suspicious, like a script running in loops.\n\nNext, I notice several entries from 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory and AppReadiness folder. Svchost is a common system process, but creating multiple temporary files, especially with unusual names, might be a red flag for malicious activity. It's possible they're part of legitimate operations, but it's worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThen there are entries from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' modifying registry values. Runtime Broker handles app container activation, so some registry changes could be normal. However, multiple writes without clear purpose might indicate tampering or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe last few events involve 'powershell.exe'. It loaded several DLLs and created a temp file. PowerShell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also execute malicious commands. The creation of a .psm1 file in the Temp directory stands out because script files like this could be part of a payload or persistence scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The repeated use of setup.exe, svchost, and powershell, along with specific file creations and registry modifications, suggest possible malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe accessing a process. That's common for scripts. The second is creating a file in the PowerShell Startup directory—this could be for profile initialization, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nThird, there's a command line indicating that PowerShell is executing some script with an execution policy set to Restricted. It's looking through INF files and checking for specific patterns. This might be legitimate admin work, but Restricted policies usually prevent script execution, so this could raise a flag.\n\nLooking at the image loads, they're loading various DLLs which is normal for PowerShell. The file creation in Temp for a .psm1 file—PowerShell module—is notable but again, not necessarily malicious unless it's doing something unexpected.\n\nNext, cmd.exe and Dism.exe are used with commands to disable Windows Defender features like Remove and NoRestart. Using Dism with such parameters is part of legitimate system administration, especially if you're trying to modify or remove defender components. However, disabling defender could be a red flag in some contexts, but it's also common for troubleshooting.\n\nThe Dism.exe process then creates files in a temporary directory, including executables and DLLs with names like AppxProvider and AssocProvider. These might be related to package provider operations, which is part of normal system updates or installations. The creation of DismHost.exe could be part of the update process—though sometimes malicious actors use such files as droppers.\n\nThe repeated FileExecutableDetected events for different DLLs might trigger alerts because they're detecting executables in temporary locations. This could indicate either legitimate file operations during an update or potential malware dropping files.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The script execution with restricted policies, disabling defender features, and creating multiple temp files could be signs of malicious activity. However, these actions can also occur in legitimate scenarios like system updates or admin tasks. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because there are several red flags, but I'm not entirely certain without further analysis. My confidence is around 0.6 because while the activities seem concerning, they might also be part of a legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands with potentially suspicious activity, including disabling Windows Defender features and creating temporary files which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}

It's a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing operating systems. So, on its own, seeing Dism.exe running isn't unusual.\n\nNext, the winlog field in each event indicates that it's the \"File Executable Detected\" task with a specific rule. This suggests that the system is monitoring file operations and detecting executable files. Again, this is standard Windows behavior to prevent malicious executables from being run without detection.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp' in various subfolders. The naming conventions like 'DismProv.dll.mui', 'IBSProvider.dll.mui', and so on seem to be related to system components or language files. These are common in temporary directories where Windows might extract files during updates or installations.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. Dism.exe is a known legitimate process, the file paths point to standard temporary locations, and the detected files appear to be part of normal operations.

Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n- The process name is 'Dism.exe' and it's related to File Executable Detected.\n- Then, there are multiple events where 'DismHost.exe' loads various DLLs like Provider.dll files.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing operations. It's part of the Windows Deployment Services. The fact that it's detecting executables and loading images doesn't seem unusual on its own because these are normal operations during deployment or system setup.\n\nThe paths all lead to temporary directories, which makes sense because temporary files are often created there during such processes. All the file paths point to the same user directory, indicating a single instance of DismHost.exe handling multiple DLLs, which is expected behavior for such tools.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like unexpected process names or access to unusual files.

That seems normal because DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tools are used for servicing Windows images. The second event is the termination of that process, which also aligns with standard operations since processes start and stop regularly.\n\nNext, I see multiple events from Dism.exe performing file deletions in a temporary directory. The paths all point to files under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by various DLLs and MUI files. These are typically part of the DISM tool's operation when cleaning up after servicing or updates.\n\nI notice that each event is logging a file deletion, but these deletions occur during normalDISM operations. The files being deleted are temporary and related to system updates or image servicing. There's also an event where Dism.exe changes the creation time of a file, which could be part of the cleanup process.\n\nSince all these actions are within the context of DISM processes and involve standard file operations in a temp directory, they don't raise any red flags. The repetition of file deletions is consistent with how DISM handles temporary files during servicing tasks.\n\nTherefore, while each individual event might look suspicious at first glance, considering them collectively shows that this batch relates to legitimate system maintenance activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file operations by DISM processes, including loading and deleting temporary files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

It seems like it's related to some system activities on a Windows machine. Let me break it down piece by piece.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries in the logs. Each entry has three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The values under these keys provide different kinds of information about what's happening on the system.\n\nLooking at the first entry:\n- **Process**: It mentions a specific process with an image path and some GUIDs, tasks, file hashes, etc. This seems detailed but might be part of some monitoring or logging tool.\n- **Winlog**: The task here is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\", which tells me that something changed in the Windows registry.\n- **File**: It's null, so no specific file was involved in this activity.\n\nThe second entry has:\n- **Process**: Named 'services.exe', which I recognize as a system process related to services and driver components.\n- **Winlog**: Again, \"Registry value set\", indicating another change in the registry.\n- **File**: Still null, so not tied to any specific file.\n\nThird entry:\n- **Process**: 'sppsvc.exe' is listed. This seems familiar; I think it's related to software protection or updates.\n- **Winlog**: The task is \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\", which means a DLL or other image was loaded into memory.\n- **File**: Points to 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\taskschd.dll', which is the Task Scheduler service.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell commands here, which is interesting because they can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is being executed with commands that create a new service and start it. The command lines look suspicious because they're using `New-Service` and `Start-Service`, which could indicate an attempt to install or run unauthorized services on the system. The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\", seem unusual and possibly crafted to look legitimate but might actually be malicious.\n\nThen there are other events where PowerShell is used with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which restricts script execution but could also be a way to hide malicious activities. The commands here write \"Final result: 1\" or similar messages, which might be part of a check or verification process during an attack.\n\nSome entries have `task` values like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks are related to service provider and engine events in Windows, so seeing them paired with these PowerShell commands makes me think that the scripts could be manipulating services or components at a low level, which is a red flag for potential attacks.\n\nI also notice that similar commands are repeated multiple times across different event logs. This repetition might suggest a script running multiple instances or part of a larger campaign to ensure persistence or spread across systems. It's concerning because it indicates possible automated malicious activity rather than isolated incidents.\n\nPutting all this together, the batch shows several signs of potential malicious behavior: creating new services, using PowerShell with restricted policies, repeated suspicious commands, and events tied to system service management.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events in JSONL format and determine if they're interesting for investigation or not. The user has given me four events, each with some process details, Windows logs, and file info.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure. Each line is a separate event. Let's parse them one by one.\n\nThe first three events all have similar command lines in the 'process' field. They're running powershell.exe with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command itself seems to be scanning INF files in the Windows directory, checking for specific patterns related to installation sections. It looks like it's trying to determine if any of these INF files contain a particular section name.\n\nThe fourth event is different; the process is 'None', but there's a 'winlog' task called 'Special Logon'. This usually relates to user logon events, possibly indicating system startup or user login activities.\n\nNow, looking at the 'task' field in the winlog entries: two of them are 'Engine Lifecycle' and one is 'Provider Lifecycle'. These seem related to Windows Event Tracing for Security (ETW) events. The first three events might be part of some process monitoring activity, perhaps an integrity scan or a script checking system files.\n\nThe command line in the process events stands out because it's using powershell.exe in restricted mode. Restricted mode can limit certain operations but is sometimes used by legitimate scripts to prevent malicious code execution. However, it could also be a way for attackers to hide their actions if they're trying not to be detected by the system.\n\nThe script reads all INF files in the Windows\\inf directory and looks for specific patterns. The regex '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]' is looking for a section that starts with 'defaultinstall.nt' followed by an architecture type. This could be part of checking for driver or component installations, perhaps verifying the presence of certain system components.\n\nI wonder why this script is being run multiple times. The first three events are identical except for their winlog tasks, which might indicate different phases of a process or timing.\n\nThe fourth event with 'Special Logon' makes me think about logon processes and whether they're happening around the same time as these script executions. Could there be a correlation between user logons and the script running?\n\nPutting it all together: the batch involves a powershell script checking system INF files, which could be legitimate for system health checks or updates. However, since it's using restricted execution, it might be trying to avoid detection mechanisms, which raises a red flag. Also, repeated executions of similar commands without clear justification could indicate malicious activity.\n\nI need to assess whether this combination is unusual enough to warrant investigation. The presence of multiple identical process events and the use of powershell in restricted mode under different log contexts (like engine lifecycle and special logon) might suggest a broader campaign or unauthorized access.\n\nOn the other hand, these could be part of normal system maintenance scripts, especially if they're scheduled. But given that there's no file access mentioned, just process logs, it's hard to say definitively without more context.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of repeated powershell executions with restricted policies and checking system INF files might indicate malicious intent or at least unusual behavior that deserves closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell executing a script in restricted mode, scanning for specific patterns in system INF files, combined with special logon events and engine lifecycle tasks suggest potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
