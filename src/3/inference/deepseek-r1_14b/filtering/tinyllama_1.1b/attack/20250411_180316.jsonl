{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this batch of system log events is something that needs investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries from `powershell.exe` accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be a red flag because attackers often use it. The fact that it's accessing different processes (like `Process accessed`) might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nThen there are several instances where `chrome.exe` sets registry values. While Chrome itself doesn't usually do malicious things, unusual registry modifications could be suspicious, especially if they're done multiple times across sessions.\n\nI notice `WMIC.exe` being used with a command to delete processes (`wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete`). WMIC is known for its remote execution capabilities and can be abused by attackers. Deleting processes might indicate attempts to cover tracks or terminate protective services.\n\nLooking at the `cmd.exe` events, one has a command line argument deleting a scheduled task (`schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f`). Deleting tasks could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms, which is a common tactic in malware. Another cmd.exe event runs `whoami.exe`, which might be used to gather system information, possibly for reconnaissance.\n\nThere's also a process involving `svchost.exe` modifying the registry. Since svchost is a legitimate Windows process, but it can be exploited by malware, this could indicate malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential attacker behavior: using PowerShell and cmd for suspicious actions, deleting tasks, using WMIC to terminate processes, and running whoami. The repetition across different processes suggests coordinated activities rather than isolated incidents. This makes me think there's a high likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events such as registry modifications by various processes, including PowerShell and cmd.exe, deletion of processes via WMIC, and the use of whoami.exe.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell is being used, which immediately catches my attention because it's a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The task here is setting a registry value, which can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe creating a process with an empty command line. That seems odd; usually, you'd see some actual command being executed. Empty might mean it's waiting for something else or trying to hide its actions.\n\nThen another cmd.exe setting a registry value again. This repetition makes me think of scripts or automated processes that might be running multiple times, possibly trying to stay under the radar.\n\nMoving on, Chrome loading AMSI and MpOAV DLLs is normal; those are part of Windows Defender. No issues there, so not too concerning.\n\nThe conhost.exe setting a registry value also stands out. Conhost is often used in command-line tools but can sometimes be involved in malicious activities as it's lightweight and can execute commands without being easily detected by antivirus software.\n\nI notice multiple entries where PowerShell accesses other processes. This could indicate process injection or lateral movement within the system, which are red flags for potential attacks. Also, there are several image loads from .NET frameworks, which might be normal but sometimes used maliciously to load harmful libraries.\n\nThere's a file deletion event logged by PowerShell, specifically deleting a temporary script. That makes me think about attempts to remove evidence or scripts that could have been executed earlier. Temporary files related to PowerShell scripts can indicate malicious activities trying to clean up their tracks.\n\nTwo events with 'powershell.exe & {}' in the command line look suspicious. The '&' might be used to execute additional commands, but having it empty suggests something's off. It could be a way to bypass certain logging or detection mechanisms by not directly showing the command run.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, especially registry modifications, process accesses, and file deletions. These actions don't seem to be normal user behavior. The repeated use of these processes, coupled with suspicious command lines and evidence of script deletion, increases my concern. There's a pattern suggesting potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence or move laterally within the system.\n\nHowever, without more context on the baseline activities for this system, it's hard to be certain. But given the number of red flags, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities including registry modifications, process accesses, and file deletions suggest potential malicious behavior. The repeated use of these processes with suspicious command lines indicates possible script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm looking at a batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each line represents an event with some attributes related to processes, Windows logs, and files.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts. The repeated use of `powershell.exe` could be a red flag if the commands being executed are not clearly benign.\n\nLooking closer, some events show that `powershell.exe` is being called with command lines that include conditional checks using `Test-Path`. For example:\n```\n{command_line': 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}'}\n```\nThis seems to be checking if a specific `.bat` file exists. The fact that the script exits with 0 if the file exists and 1 otherwise might indicate an attempt to verify the presence of another malicious script or payload on the system.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where `powershell.exe` loads various DLLs like `MpClient.dll` and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. While these could be part of normal operations, certain DLLs being loaded without clear context might warrant investigation. Furthermore, registry value sets (`RegistryEvent`) can be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes made by malware.\n\nAnother point is the event where `whoami.exe` was executed:\n```\n{\"process\":\"{'name': 'whoami.exe', 'command_line': '\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\whoami.exe\\\"'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}\n```\nWhile `whoami` is a legitimate command, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities could be part of an attack chain to gather system information.\n\nThere's also an event where the file path includes `.winlogbeat.yml.new`, which might suggest that this is from the WinlogBeat installation or configuration. This doesn't seem immediately suspicious on its own but could be related if there are other indicators pointing towards malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple instances of `powershell.exe` with potentially malicious scripting, file checks, and registry modifications, along with the execution of other tools that don't have clear benign explanations in this context. These activities collectively suggest possible malicious behavior, making the batch relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances executing suspicious scripts and checking file existence, along with registry modifications and other potentially malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs. There are multiple events here, all involving processes running powershell.exe and chrome.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several events where powershell.exe is loading images, creating files, deleting files, and accessing the registry. These actions aren't inherently suspicious on their own since PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks. However, the specific file paths mentioned might raise some eyebrows. For instance, a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 being created and deleted quickly could be part of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to bypass certain security policies. The fact that this happens in the Temp directory is a bit concerning because temporary files are often used by malware for short-term operations.\n\nAnother point is the use of Registry value sets by chrome.exe. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings, multiple entries without any context could indicate something fishy, especially if they're not related to typical browser activities. But considering it's just three events and all from chrome.exe, maybe it's part of an update or setting change.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some powershell.exe processes, there are attempts to create files with .bat extensions using Set-Content and New-Item cmdlets. This seems like script injection or file creation that might be trying to execute arbitrary commands on the system. The paths used here seem a bit convoluted, moving up directories multiple times, which could be an attempt to write scripts in non-standard locations, possibly avoiding detection.\n\nThe repetition of loading MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender is interesting too. These are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded multiple times by powershell.exe, it might indicate some form of process injection or malicious activity that's leveraging known system binaries to stay under the radar.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are signs that could point towards potential malicious behavior—like script creation in Temp and registry manipulation—the fact that these actions are done by a legitimate process like PowerShell means they aren't conclusive. However, the combination of multiple such events across different files and processes does raise the suspicion level. It's possible that an attacker is using PowerShell for persistence or to execute scripts, which would make this batch worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show file creation, deletion, and registry activity, including attempts to create .bat files.

I'm trying to determine if there's anything suspicious here that would require investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers for command execution and script operations, so it's something to watch out for. \n\nLooking at the first event, the process shows a command line with some PowerShell code creating files in specific paths like \"modulo_base\" and \"pacote_temporario\". The commands are using New-Item and Set-Content, which could be legitimate but might also indicate file creation as part of malicious activity.\n\nThe next few events show various tasks related to file operations, image loading, registry access, and pipe creations. These activities in themselves aren't necessarily suspicious unless they're done outside normal user behavior or at unusual times.\n\nI see multiple instances where powershell.exe is being used with If-TestPath conditions. This might be an attempt to check if certain files exist before proceeding, which could be part of a script trying to establish persistence or perform actions only under specific conditions.\n\nThe file paths mentioned are quite generic and don't immediately raise red flags, but the repeated use of PowerShell across multiple events is concerning. It's possible that this could be part of an attempt to drop malicious scripts or execute commands without user interaction.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior. The repeated command-line operations and file creations using PowerShell are indicative enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating files in various locations with complex paths and using If-TestPath conditions, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. So, I'm supposed to analyze all these JSON objects together and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. That immediately catches my attention because PowerShell is often used by both admins and attackers for various tasks. It can be a red flag when there's a lot of activity from it, especially unusual commands or behaviors.\n\nLooking closer, several events show file creations. For example, in line 1, winlogbeat.exe creates a new YAML file, which seems normal for log management tools. But then, multiple PowerShell instances are creating files and checking paths like \"C:\\objeto_principal...\"—that doesn't look standard. Why would they be testing if certain files exist?\n\nThere's also process creation events where PowerShell is invoked with specific command lines. The commands seem to be checking the existence of certain files and exiting based on that. That behavior could indicate a script trying to verify if it has the right setup or maybe attempting to download something, but it's hard to tell from just these logs.\n\nI see tasks like Image Load, Process Access, Pipe Created, and Registry Value Set. These are common for legitimate processes, but when combined with repeated file checks, it could mean something more malicious, like persistence mechanisms or credential dumping attempts.\n\nThe fact that multiple events are from the same user account (fiddelis) doing similar actions across different directories is concerning. It might indicate a script running in the background performing checks across various locations on the system.\n\nI'm also noticing that some of these events are repetitive and target specific file paths, which could be part of an attempt to ensure malicious files are present or to spread across the system. The use of RegistryEvent tasks suggests they might be trying to create or modify registry entries for persistence.\n\nConsidering all this together, while individual events might not seem suspicious, the combination points towards potential malicious activity, possibly related to lateral movement or establishing persistence. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are showing file creation attempts and registry modifications, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by analyzing each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting and potentially malicious activities. However, not all powershell usage is bad; sometimes it's legitimate for system administration.\n\nI notice that several events mention tasks like \"Process Create\" and \"Process Access.\" These could indicate normal process activity, but repeated accesses to the same file or process might be suspicious. For example, if a script is checking for the existence of specific files multiple times, it could be part of an infection check or persistence mechanism.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some powershell.exe instances have complex command-line arguments. They're using \"if\" statements to test whether certain files exist in various directories. If these files don't exist, they exit with 0; if they do, they exit with 1. This behavior could be part of a script checking its own presence or verifying required components before executing malicious code.\n\nThe fact that the same pattern repeats across different paths suggests a possible attempt to check multiple locations for specific files. This kind of activity is common in malware where it tries different locations to avoid detection or to ensure all necessary components are present.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where powershell.exe accesses a registry value. Registry access can be part of legitimate operations, but combined with the file checks, it might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or gather information, which could be malicious.\n\nThe files mentioned in the events don't seem suspicious at first glance—paths like System32 and Windows are standard. However, the repeated checking of specific .cs files across different paths could imply a more targeted approach, possibly related to injecting code into processes or altering system behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions might not be alarming, the combination of multiple powershell.exe instances with complex command lines checking various file paths and accessing registry values raises concerns. This pattern resembles potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence or verify conditions before executing further commands.\n\nTherefore, this batch is classified as INTERESTING because the repeated process creations and file checks could indicate a malicious script attempting to ensure it's running in an environment conducive to its purpose.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with command-line arguments checking for specific files across various paths, potentially indicating malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see... There are several entries here, all involving powershell.exe and some other processes like whoami.exe.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve powershell.exe with different command lines checking for the existence of various script files. For example, one event checks C:\\estrutura_temporario\\entrada_ativo\\tarefa_base\\src\\elemento_base.cs and another checks C:\\tarefa_geral\\unidade_logico\\tarefa_logico\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repeated checking of different script paths seems suspicious. It looks like the process is verifying if these scripts exist before proceeding, which might be a tactic to avoid detection or ensure that certain malicious scripts are present.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files are created and then deleted, such as __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1 and __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Temporary script files being created and deleted could be part of a process to execute malicious code without leaving long-term traces, or perhaps testing if the scripts are allowed by certain policies.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe is common in cyberattacks because it's a legitimate tool with powerful scripting capabilities. The repeated file operations and registry modifications (like setting a registry value) might indicate an attempt to persist across reboots or change system configurations maliciously.\n\nMoreover, some events show pipes being created. This could be related to communication between processes or possibly for stealing credentials or other sensitive information. Also, the loading of various DLLs like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll might be part of obfuscating the attack or using legitimate components in an unauthorized way.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is running, which typically retrieves user information. If this is triggered by a malicious script, it could be gathering details about the system's current user for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell instances checking for scripts, creating and deleting temporary files, registry modifications, pipe creations, and the use of whoami.exe. These activities don't seem to be part of normal user behavior or standard system operations. They exhibit several red flags commonly associated with malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms, file manipulation, and information gathering.\n\nTherefore, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation because it shows signs that could indicate a potential security breach or attack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances checking for script existence, creating\/deleting temporary files, and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

This script likely has malicious intent since it's trying to see if the file exists and exit otherwise. The fact that this script is located in temporary directories like \"tarefa_temporario\" suggests it might be part of an attack.\n\nNext, there are several registry modifications by PowerShell, which could indicate tampering with system configurations or persistence mechanisms. Registry changes can be a red flag for malicious activity as attackers often set up persistent backdoors.\n\nLooking at other events, I see Chrome making network connections and DNS queries, which is normal, but since the focus is on suspicious activities, these might not raise flags on their own. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell executions with specific scripts and registry changes makes this batch concerning.\n\nThe events are spread across different timestamps, showing a series of actions that could be part of an attack chain, such as initial access, script execution, and system configuration changes. This sequence is indicative of potential malicious behavior rather than normal user activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of PowerShell activities checking for a specific script and making registry changes raises suspicion.

Let's break down each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial event shows PowerShell.exe deleting a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_usaxxrks.kqe.ps1. That seems suspicious because scripts with \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" often relate to bypassing script execution policies, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.\n\nThe next few events show PowerShell.exe creating pipes and executing commands like 'ls -recurse', 'get-childitem -recurse', and 'gci -recurse'. These are directory listing commands but repeated multiple times. Repeating these could be part of enumerating the file system, which might indicate reconnaissance or data gathering.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they consistently call PowerShell with ampersand and curly braces, which is a technique to execute code in a way that's less easily detected by some monitoring tools. The repetition of this exact command line across multiple events suggests automation or scripting, possibly part of a larger script or malicious payload.\n\nThere are also events where other processes like winlogbeat.exe create files. For example, creating .winlogbeat.yml.new might be legitimate, but it's worth checking if this process is running as expected and whether the file creation is authorized. However, since it's from a known log tool, it might not be malicious on its own.\n\nAnother event shows PowerShell accessing a registry value. This can be part of configuration or persistence mechanisms, which are often used by malware to maintain their presence on a system.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that could be for enumeration, script deletion indicating possible attempts to cover tracks, and repeated command lines suggesting automated behavior. These factors increase the suspicion level because they exhibit behaviors commonly associated with malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell.exe executing commands that could be part of reconnaissance or script execution, including file deletions and repeated directory listings.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
