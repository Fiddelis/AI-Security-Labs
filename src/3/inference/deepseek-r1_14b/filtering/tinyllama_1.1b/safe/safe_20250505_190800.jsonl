{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal because it's probably just the log shipping agent doing its job.\n\nNext, there are multiple powershell.exe processes being created and various image loads from .NET frameworks. These could be standard operations since PowerShell often uses these components.\n\nI notice several events related to Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle for PowerShell. Again, this is typical behavior when PowerShell starts up or interacts with certain modules.\n\nThere's an event where a file is deleted in the Temp directory. The path includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1\". This looks suspicious because script policy test files are often used by malicious scripts to bypass restrictions, so this could indicate some kind of scripting activity.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. Malware sometimes creates or modifies profile data to persist across reboots, which adds more concern.\n\nThe last event mentions executing a Remote Command, which is a red flag because remote commands can be used for lateral movement or to execute malicious code on other systems.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of script policy testing, file deletions in Temp, and remote command execution suggests potential malicious activity. While some events are normal, others point towards possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities including file creation\/deletion and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
