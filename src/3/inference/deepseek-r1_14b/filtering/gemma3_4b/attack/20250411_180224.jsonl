{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe being used with commands that create scheduled tasks. For example, there are multiple instances where schtasks.exe is called with parameters like \/create, which suggests the creation of new tasks. The command lines within these events are trying to execute PowerShell scripts, some of which reference non-existent files like NonExistingScript.ps1 and entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. This might be a red flag because using non-existent script paths could indicate an attempt to bypass detection or perhaps the script was deleted after execution.\n\nNext, I see several registry events (Registry value set) from processes like svchost.exe and cmd.exe. Svchost is a common system process, but repeated registry writes can sometimes be malicious activities, especially if they're part of creating persistence mechanisms for malware. Also, multiple attempts by different processes to modify the registry might indicate an ongoing attempt to establish persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThere are also file creation events where powershell.exe creates files like estrutura_geral.txt. Without knowing the content of this file, it's hard to say, but creating new files can be part of data exfiltration or setting up malicious configurations.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that there are multiple instances of chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does update its settings in the registry during updates or installations, so many events from Chrome could be suspicious if they're not aligned with known updates or user activities.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the sequence of events, it seems like a series of commands executed over time that involve creating scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and file operations. The repetition and combination of these actions across different processes (cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, powershell.exe) might be indicative of automated malicious activity or an attack chain.\n\nThe fact that some of these events reference non-existent scripts suggests possible failed attempts or obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. Malware often uses such tactics to ensure that its commands don't leave clear traces.\n\nIn summary, the batch shows multiple indicators of potential malicious behavior: creating scheduled tasks with suspicious command lines, registry modifications by various processes, and repeated actions that might not be typical user activity. These factors together make me think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of process creation, registry modifications, and file operations involving potentially malicious activities such as creating scheduled tasks with powershell.exe commands.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I have a batch of five JSON events that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, looking at each event:\n\n1. The first event is from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file named `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely updating its configuration.\n\n2. The second and fourth events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any activity with it might be worth looking into. \n\n3. The third event shows that PowerShell accessed a process. This could mean it's interacting with other running processes, which might be part of normal scripting but could also indicate something more nefarious like process injection or privilege escalation.\n\n4. The fourth event again is `whoami.exe` being run. While this command itself is generally benign and used to check user information, seeing it alongside other PowerShell activities might raise some flags, especially if there's an attempt to gather system information as part of a larger attack.\n\n5. The fifth event repeats the `ProcessAccess` task from PowerShell. Repeated process access attempts could be trying to do something systematically, which might not be normal.\n\nPutting this together, I notice that multiple events involve PowerShell accessing processes and creating files. This combination could indicate that an attacker is using PowerShell for command execution or script downloading. The creation of the `entrada_ativo.txt` file by PowerShell is also suspiciousâ€”maybe it's writing a malicious script or configuration to disk.\n\nAdditionally, seeing both `winlogbeat.exe` and `whoami.exe` alongside PowerShell might be part of an attack chain where the attacker first gathers information with whoami, then uses PowerShell for more invasive actions. The repeated process access events suggest possible lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these activities are definitively malicious, but they do present enough red flags that merit closer investigation. Therefore, I think this batch is interesting and warrants further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes and creating files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
