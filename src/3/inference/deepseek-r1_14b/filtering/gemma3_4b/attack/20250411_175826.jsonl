Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are from various processes. The majority involve 'chrome.exe' with network connections and DNS queries. These seem pretty normal because Chrome is a common browser that does make network requests. So, multiple entries of this might just be regular browsing activity.\n\nThen there's 'powershell.exe' appearing several times. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so it catches my attention more. The events show things like process creation, accessing processes, modifying registry values, and file operations. This could indicate scripting or automated tasks. However, without specific indicators of compromise (like known malicious scripts), it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking closer at the PowerShell command line in one event: it seems to be changing the last write time of a file using 'Get-ChildItem' and setting it to an old date. This could be an attempt to hide the file's true modification time, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. That definitely raises a red flag.\n\nThere are also multiple image load events from PowerShell, which might just be normal operation since scripts often load various libraries. But combined with other actions, it adds some concern about potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file creation and deletion of '__PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1' in the Temp directory. Temporary files are common, but deleting them quickly might be an attempt to remove evidence, which is another red flag.\n\nOther processes like 'RuntimeBroker.exe' and 'notepad.exe' modifying registry values don't seem unusual on their own. They could be part of legitimate operations or system tweaks.\n\nPutting it all together, while some actions by PowerShell are concerning (registry modifications, file timestamp changes, creating\/deleting temp files), without concrete evidence of malicious behavior, it's hard to definitively label this as an attack. However, the combination does warrant closer examination because certain activities, like changing file timestamps and using PowerShell for potentially malicious scripting, could indicate a threat actor attempting to hide their tracks or perform malicious tasks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe performing actions such as process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and network activities. These actions could indicate potential malicious behavior, particularly the modification of a file's last write time and the creation\/deletion of temporary files in PowerShell.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell.exe processes with command lines that look suspicious. They're using Get-ChildItem to find files in various paths and then changing their LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\", which is the epoch time. This seems like an attempt to modify file timestamps, possibly to hide recent changes or activity. That's a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events where svchost.exe is modifying registry values. Svchost.exe is commonly used by legitimate services, but it can also be abused by malware for persistence or other malicious activities. The fact that these events are repeated might indicate some kind of automated process trying to establish persistence in the system.\n\nThere's also an event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. While this isn't inherently suspicious on its own, when combined with the other activities, it could be part of a broader attack vector. Malware often uses legitimate processes like Calculator or svchost.exe to execute malicious code.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a file by PowerShell in the StartupProfileData directory. This might indicate that some configuration is being set up during startup, which could be used for persistence after system reboots. Additionally, the process named conhost.exe modifying registry values adds another layer of concern, as conhost is often associated with command-line tools and can sometimes be exploited.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file. While WinlogBeat is a legitimate tool for log management, if it's part of this batch, I need to check if its activity aligns with expected behavior. If it's behaving abnormally, that could signal tampering or misuse.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they exhibit signs of potential malicious activities such as timestamp manipulation, registry modifications, and the use of legitimate processes for suspicious tasks. The combination suggests a possible attack chain where an adversary is attempting to cover their tracks, establish persistence, or deploy malware on the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell.exe activities with file timestamp manipulation and potential registry modifications, along with other unusual process behaviors that may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few different processes here: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and some others. The tasks mentioned are things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Pipe Created, Image loaded, File created, etc.\n\nI notice that Calculator.exe is setting a registry value. That's not too unusual, but it depends on what exactly it's doing. Then there's powershell.exe being used for both a registry change and some file creation. Powershell can be malicious if used to execute scripts or create files in unexpected places.\n\nBut looking closer, most of the events are from chrome.exe. It seems like Chrome is doing a lot of Registry value sets—like 13 times. Also, it's loading some system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are standard Windows Defender components. That part seems normal because Chrome would need to interact with these for security purposes.\n\nThere are also events from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so that's probably just setting up its environment.\n\nThe two FileCreate tasks by powershell.exe and chrome.exe caught my attention. Specifically, the powershell.exe created 'unidade_logico.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's a bit odd because why would PowerShell create a file there? It might be innocent if it's part of some script, but it could also be malicious activity trying to hide data.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the events are standard operations from legitimate processes like Chrome and Windows Defender components. The repeated Registry writes by Chrome could indicate something, but given that Chrome is a browser with many extensions and plugins, some registry activity isn't unusual. However, the volume here seems high—13 times—so it's worth noting.\n\nI also think about whether these events are part of a larger pattern. If there were more suspicious activities, like multiple processes accessing the same files or registry keys, that would be a red flag. But in this case, each event is isolated to its own process and task, so it might not indicate coordinated malicious behavior.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while some actions are concerning, they don't definitively prove malicious activity without more context. The powershell.exe creating a file could be part of legitimate script execution, but it's worth monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creation by Chrome and PowerShell may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
