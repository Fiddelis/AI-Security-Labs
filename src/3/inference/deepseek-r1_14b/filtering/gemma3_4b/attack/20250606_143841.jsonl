Let's look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The first few events show powershell.exe being created, which could be normal but might indicate something if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one event shows powershell.exe with a command line that includes \"& {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". That looks suspicious. The New-PSDrive cmdlet is used to create a new PowerShell drive, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack. The argument \"-unidade_auxiliar\" doesn't look standard; maybe it's a typo or a mistake, but it raises flags.\n\nThere are several events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and creates files in temporary directories. For example, creating \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\" in the Temp folder is unusual. Temporary script files can be used to execute malicious code without persisting on disk for long. The fact that this file is created and then deleted shortly after (as seen in a later event) suggests an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .dll files. While normal scripts do load libraries, the specific ones here might be indicators of malicious activity or part of legitimate operations. However, combined with other events, it's concerning.\n\nThe batch also includes whoami.exe being executed twice. Whoami is often used to check user privileges and can be part of reconnaissance during an attack. The fact that it's run in conjunction with powershell activities might indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting this all together: repeated powershell activity, including creating drives, writing temporary scripts, accessing registry, loading modules, along with whoami executions, suggests a potential malicious campaign, possibly involving persistence or lateral movement. The actions seem like they could be part of an attack chain, making the batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines and activities including registry access, file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, and the use of whoami.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is being accessed and created. That immediately raises some flags because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell for malicious activities due to its built-in capabilities for scripting and system management.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a cmd.exe process with an empty command line, which seems suspicious on its own but combined with the PowerShell activity could indicate something more. Then, I see whoami.exe being executed, which is often used to check user privileges or permissions. This might be part of reconnaissance activities to understand the system context.\n\nAnother point that stands out is the file creation and deletion events by PowerShell. Specifically, a script file is created and then quickly deleted. Such behavior can be indicative of attempting to bypass certain security policies or leaving minimal traces. Additionally, there's a pipe created, which could be used for inter-process communication—something attackers might use to hide their command-line arguments or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe numerous image loads from various DLLs might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but the combination with other events suggests potential malicious scripting execution. The repeated FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected tasks on temporary files further support the idea that something was being tested or executed without leaving持久性 (persistence) behind.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple PowerShell instances, creation\/deletion of script files, use of whoami.exe, and suspicious file operations—it seems like this batch could be part of an attack chain. The activities could be linked to testing system permissions, executing malicious scripts, or attempting persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances with file creation\/deletion and suspicious activity indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user mentioned that it's a JSONL format with each line being a JSON object.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. There are several instances where powershell.exe is accessing processes, setting registry values, and loading various images. These actions alone might be suspicious, but I need to consider the context.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a file creation event for __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1 in the Temp directory. That script name sounds like it could be testing some policy or might be part of a persistence mechanism. Also, right after creating this file, it's deleted. This create-delete cycle is a common tactic to avoid detection by leaving fewer traces, which makes me think there's something to hide here.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs, includingclrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. While some of these are normal part of Powershell's operation, others like clrjit might be related to obfuscation or malicious activities. The use of Windows Defender platform files being loaded could indicate attempts to mimic legitimate processes.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory, which could mean persistence across reboots if it's not properly managed. Combining all these events, the repeated powershell.exe activity with file creation\/deletion and registry modifications suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the red flags like script testing, file deletions for cover, and possible persistence mechanisms. The confidence is high because several indicators together point to possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and loading of various DLLs suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's a common system utility used to display user information. Not inherently suspicious unless it's part of a larger pattern. Next, there's a PowerShell process being accessed, but no file involved. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye on how this unfolds.\n\nThe third event shows \"svchost.exe\" creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization directory. That seems odd because svchost is typically associated with system services, not usually creating files there. Maybe it's related to some optimization process, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen again, PowerShell accesses something without a file context. It could be checking permissions or running scripts. The next event has whoami.exe being created again, which might indicate repeated attempts or part of a script.\n\nLooking further down, another PowerShell process is started with a command line that checks if \"procdump.exe\" exists in a specific path and exits based on its presence. Procdump is a legitimate tool for capturing processes but can also be used maliciously to check if certain tools are present, possibly to avoid detection. This behavior seems more suspicious.\n\nThere's a series of events where PowerShell loads various DLLs, which is normal for script execution. However, then it creates and immediately deletes a file in the Temp directory. Creating temporary files and deleting them quickly can be part of malicious activities to avoid leaving traces. Also, the fact that it uses a named pipe (Pipe Created) might indicate communication with another process.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of PowerShell and the specific checks for procdump.exe, along with creating and deleting files in Temp, could indicate command and control or payload delivery. The combination suggests possible malicious behavior, so this batch is definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion, registry access, and suspicious process checks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each log is showing.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is involved. Powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, so that raises an eyebrow. Then, whoami.exe was run a couple times, which might not be suspicious on its own but could be part of privilege escalation attempts if combined with other actions.\n\nI notice cmd.exe being used with the command \"\/c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". That's a classic way to disable Windows Defender Firewall. Disabling antivirus or firewall is often an indicator of malicious activity because attackers want to prevent detection after compromising a system.\n\nAlso, there are several instances where netsh.exe was used with similar commands to turn off the firewall. This repetition makes me think it's intentional and part of a broader attack strategy.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe events, which is another common process that can be legitimate or malicious. The logs show multiple registry changes, which could indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or create persistence points for malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of disabling firewall settings with powershell and netsh commands, along with potential registry modifications by svchost.exe, suggests a coordinated attack. These activities are often red flags for security professionals because they can lead to system compromise or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the pattern of events aligns with common tactics used in cyberattacks. The confidence is high because multiple malicious indicators are present across different processes and actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities, including the use of powershell.exe for process access, creation of files in user-specific directories, disabling of Windows Defender Firewall using netsh commands, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events that all have the same structure. Each event shows that svchost.exe is running and there's a registry event indicating an object was added or deleted. Since these are standard operations often performed by legitimate Windows services, they don't seem suspicious on their own. Plus, there's no additional context like file access or other anomalies to suggest anything malicious. So, I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show svchost.exe modifying the registry, which is common for legitimate system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I'm given a batch of 20 JSONL events, each representing some system activity on a Windows machine. My task is to determine whether this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of each event. Each JSON object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The file field seems to always be null in these events, so I won't focus on that for now.\n\nLooking at the first 14 events, all of them involve 'svchost.exe' as the process name and a registry-related task in the winlog. Specifically, they mention either \"Registry object added or deleted\" or \"Registry value set.\" Now, svchost.exe is a known legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. It's common for such processes to interact with the Windows Registry because many system services store configuration data there.\n\nThe next events (15-20) are different. Here, the process command line shows powershell.exe executing a script: {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}. This translates to creating a new PowerShell drive mapped to a remote location at \\\\Target\\\\C$. The winlog tasks here are either \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle.\"\n\nAt first glance, using powershell.exe to create a network drive might raise some flags. However, I need to consider the context of these events together with the others in the batch.\n\nSo, the initial 14 events are all registry-related by svchost.exe. While it's true that malicious actors often use svchost.exe for their activities due to its legitimate reputation, there's nothing inherently suspicious here without more context. These could be legitimate system processes updating or accessing registry keys.\n\nThe latter events involving PowerShell are a bit more concerning because they involve network activity—mapping a drive to a remote location. However, in this case, the command seems to be creating a new PS Drive for filesystem access at \\\\Target\\\\C$. Without additional information, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just part of some script or legitimate administrative task.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of these events—multiple instances of the same process and tasks—is notable. If this were an attack, I would expect more varied activities across different processes or at least some attempt to blend in with normal traffic. Here, the repetition might indicate automated testing or configuration rather than malicious intent.\n\nAnother angle is the source of these logs. If this was a real-time monitoring scenario, seeing multiple Registry changes by svchost.exe followed by PowerShell commands could be concerning. But since it's a batch of events without timestamps or other context like user activity, it's harder to assess the timeline and sequence of events.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether the combination of these activities is unusual. If svchost.exe is making multiple Registry changes and then another process (powershell.exe) is creating network drives, is this a common behavior? It depends on the system's normal operation. On a system where services are being managed or scripts are run regularly, such events might be part of normal operations.\n\nFurthermore, I don't see any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like known malicious file hashes, unusual process behaviors beyond what's expected for these processes, or signs of privilege escalation. The fact that the powershell.exe command is creating a drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$ could imply targeting another machine on the network, but without knowing if \"Target\" is an actual hostname and whether this access is authorized, it's hard to judge.\n\nThe lack of file activity in all events also makes me less concerned because many malicious activities would involve file operations. Since files are null across the board, there's no evidence of file creation, deletion, or modification here.\n\nIn summary, while each event individually might raise some eyebrows, collectively they don't present a clear pattern of malicious behavior. The repetition and type of processes involved align more with legitimate system activity or script execution rather than an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: NOT INTERESTING**\n\n**Justification:**\n- **svchost.exe Registry Activity:** The initial events involve svchost.exe interacting with the Windows Registry, which is a common and legitimate activity for system services. Without additional context indicating malicious behavior, these events are likely part of normal operations.\n  \n- **PowerShell Network Drive Creation:** The latter events show powershell.exe creating network drives. While this could be concerning, it doesn't necessarily indicate malicious intent without evidence of unauthorized access or other suspicious activities.\n\n- **Repetition and Context:** The repetitive nature of the events suggests they may be part of automated testing or legitimate script execution rather than an attack. The absence of timestamps and other contextual data hinders a more detailed analysis.\n\n**Confidence Score: 70%**\nThe confidence is moderately low due to the lack of clear malicious indicators but higher than average for this type of activity given the provided information.\n\n---\n\nThis classification concludes that, based on the available data, there's no sufficient evidence to classify these events as suspicious or concerning."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they merit investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve PowerShell executions. The command lines vary slightly but generally seem to be invoking powershell.exe with some script blocks. For example, one line has \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\", which caught my attention because it's creating a new PowerShell drive mapped to \\\\Target\\C$. That seems suspicious because such commands can be used for lateral movement in an attack, especially if the target is another system on the network.\n\nThen there are several events where the command line is just \"powershell.exe & {}\", which doesn't show any specific malicious activity at first glance. But considering that PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, repeated executions without clear purpose could be concerning. It might indicate script testing or credential dumping attempts.\n\nLooking further, some events have command lines checking if a file exists: \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This seems like an attempt to verify the presence of a specific file, possibly before executing it. Procdump is a legitimate tool for dumping processes, but in the wrong hands, it can be used maliciously.\n\nThe 'winlog' field shows tasks like 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle'. These are typical PowerShell internal events that happen when starting or stopping PowerShell. However, the combination of these logs with the command lines could indicate something more nefarious, such as script execution or module loading activities.\n\nAnother point is the frequency of these events. There's a significant number of entries (over 20), which might suggest repeated attempts or part of a larger campaign. Attackers often test multiple times to ensure their payload works without being detected.\n\nI also notice that most command lines don't have associated files (\"file\":\"None\"), meaning there are no direct file operations logged here, but the script blocks themselves could be doing other things in memory, which is harder to track.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes a mix of events. A few are more concerning (like creating a drive mapped to another system) while others are less so but still involve PowerShell without clear benign purposes. The overall pattern suggests possible malicious activity, even if individual events might not look suspicious on their own. So, the combination makes it interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple PowerShell executions with varying command lines, including attempts to access remote drives and check file existence.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system events that the user provided. There are two identical JSONL entries here. Each one describes a process where PowerShell is being executed with a specific command line.\n\nFirst, let me parse what's happening in each event. The command line seems to be checking if a file named procdump.exe exists in a certain directory. If it does, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1. This suggests that the script is trying to verify the presence of another executable on the system.\n\nNow, considering the context: PowerShell scripts are commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but they can also be vectors for malicious activity. The fact that this script is checking for the existence of procdump.exe caught my attention because I'm not immediately familiar with what that tool does. Upon a quick mental note, I recall that ProCDump is related to debugging and process dumping, which could have legitimate uses but might also be used by attackers to extract information or inject malicious code.\n\nThe two identical events indicate repeated attempts to check for the same file. This repetition makes me think of a few possibilities: perhaps the script is part of a larger process that relies on procdump.exe being present, or it's testing whether the system has certain tools installed before proceeding with something else. In cybersecurity terms, this kind of probing behavior can be a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the file field in each JSON object, it's set to \"None\". That means there's no additional file information captured alongside these events. If there were file access or creation logs, that might provide more context, but without them, I have to work with what's here.\n\nI also note that the Windows event log task is labeled as 'Engine Lifecycle', which typically relates to process creation and termination. This supports the idea that PowerShell is being launched and then exiting based on the presence check of procdump.exe.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: repeated attempts to check for a specific file using PowerShell could indicate reconnaissance or testing by an attacker. While it's possible that a legitimate script is doing this, the lack of additional context makes me lean towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to potential malicious intent.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't too high because I can't definitively prove malicious activity without more data. However, the behavior is unusual enough and aligns with common attack patterns that it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated attempts to check for the presence of procdump.exe using PowerShell, which may indicate malicious activity or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
