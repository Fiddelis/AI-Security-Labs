Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from 'chrome.exe'. There are five entries where Chrome is making network connections. That's normal because Chrome does connect to various websites for browsing. The DNS queries also make sense since browsers need to resolve domain names.\n\nNext, there are several entries involving 'powershell.exe'. This catches my attention because PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers. Let me look at what each of these events says.\n\nThe first PowerShell event shows that it accessed some process (ProcessAccess). Then, another entry creates a new process (ProcessCreate). The command line looks suspicious—it's encoding something and sending it over HTTP to example.com. That could be a sign of data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value sets from PowerShell. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. Also, several ImageLoad events load different DLLs, which is normal but combined with other actions might indicate something's off.\n\nThen, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_j0wb0i2i.xpe.ps1. PowerShell scripts in temporary folders can be risky because they're often used for malicious purposes. After creating this script, it's deleted, which is another red flag—malware might delete its traces to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell performing network activities, modifying the registry, loading various DLLs, and creating\/deleting a potentially malicious script in the Temp folder. These behaviors are not typical for legitimate use of Chrome or PowerShell. It looks like there's a high probability of malicious activity here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including registry modifications, loading of DLLs, and creation\/deletion of a script in the Temp directory suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first event is a process named powershell.exe with a task related to Pipe Created. That's interesting because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nThen, the next six events are all from the same command line in powershell.exe. They seem repetitive but let me look closer at what they're doing. The code inside is base64 encoded? Wait, no, it's using XOR with a key to encrypt some plaintext. The plaintext includes \"Path\" and a path to C:\\Users\\victim.\n\nThe encryption here might be an attempt to hide data being sent over the network. The script sets Expect100Continue to false and makes an HTTP POST request to example.com. Sending encrypted data over the internet without proper justification could indicate exfiltration of sensitive information, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it looks like someone is using PowerShell to encrypt files or data, possibly stealing information from the system. The repeated execution suggests that this might be part of a larger script or loop, which adds to the concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it involves suspicious activities: encryption without clear purpose, multiple attempts, and network communication to an external domain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing the same XOR-encrypted data POST request to an external domain may indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with some command-line arguments. The command line in the first event has a Base64 encoded string or perhaps XORed data because it's using the -bxor operator. This looks suspicious because attackers often encode their commands to evade detection. They're encoding plaintext which includes a path, and then sending it via an HTTP POST request to example.com. That seems like they might be exfiltrating data or communicating with a command-and-control server.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where PowerShell is loading different DLLs, like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. While these could be legitimate system files, the repeated loading of such modules alongside other suspicious activities raises an eyebrow.\n\nAnother point is the file creation events by winlogbeat.exe. This might be part of a log management solution, but it's worth checking if this process has suddenly started creating new configuration files in specific directories. The path mentioned seems related to a user named 'fiddelis', which could indicate user activity or perhaps an attacker using a legitimate user profile.\n\nThen there are registry changes and process accesses by various executables like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, etc. Some of these are known for being part of standard system operations, but the combination with PowerShell activities could be concerning. For instance, modifying registry values might be setting up persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations.\n\nThe DNS query event to example.com is also notable. If this domain isn't commonly visited by the system or there's no legitimate reason for it, it could indicate communication with a malicious server. Additionally, seeing multiple events where the same or similar PowerShell commands are run suggests repeated attempts at potentially malicious activities, possibly testing different ways to execute code or exfiltrate data.\n\nConsidering all these together—the use of XOR encoding in PowerShell scripts, multiple file creations and registry changes by known malicious tools, and repeated communication attempts—it seems like there's a pattern here. These indicators point towards possible unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or the installation of malware on the system. The confidence level is high because several red flags are present across different types of events, suggesting a coordinated attack rather than random noise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities, including encoded command-line arguments and network communication attempts, along with file creation and registry changes, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several instances where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious, as legitimate software often modifies the registry. But seeing multiple such events might be a red flag if they're part of an unusual pattern.\n\nThen I notice that chrome.exe is involved in multiple Registry value sets and image loads. The image load for amsi.dll could be interesting because it's related to antivirus scanning. But looking at another file path, MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender, seems normal. However, the fact that chrome.exe is accessing these might warrant closer look if there are other anomalies.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new config file. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping and management, so this is likely benign unless it's doing something unexpected with logs.\n\nWhoami.exe being executed without any unusual command line arguments seems normal—it's often used to check user permissions. However, the use of whoami in conjunction with other activities could be concerning, but here alone it doesn't raise a flag.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe events, there are multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by both admins and attackers. The command line for one instance shows an attempt to remove a batch file: Remove-Item with -Force and ignoring errors. This could indicate deletion of files, which might be malicious, especially if the script isn't authorized.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event has a command line that's obfuscated or trying to execute something tricky. The fact that it's using '&' suggests chaining commands, which is common in scripting but can also be used for hiding malicious activities.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry modifications by various processes, especially the use of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines attempting file deletions and other actions, stands out. These could be indicators of potential malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by various processes including PowerShell with potentially malicious command-line arguments, which may indicate unauthorized system changes or malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one to see if there's anything unusual.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading images and creating files. Powershell can be legitimate, but it's often used in attacks too. The file paths mentioned seem standard for .NET Framework components, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. Browsers do change registry settings during updates or configuration changes, so this is probably normal unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory. The creation and deletion within a short time could indicate script execution, which might be testing for something like file persistence or malicious activity. The specific filename __PSScriptPolicyTest seems related to PowerShell's own checks, but seeing this paired with deletions raises an eyebrow.\n\nThe last few events show powershell.exe being used with command lines that remove several .bat files from different paths. Using Remove-Item in PowerShell is common for deletion tasks, but the paths mentioned (like \"modulo_principal\" and \"registro_logico_script.bat\") seem arbitrary. This could be part of legitimate script execution, like cleaning up temporary files, but it might also signal malicious behavior such as deleting system files or logs to cover tracks.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances with file deletions and unusual command lines, along with registry changes from chrome.exe, create a concerning pattern.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of events from system logs, and my goal is to determine if these activities are interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows powershell.exe being used with a command line that removes a file using Remove-Item. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The use of \"-Force\" could indicate they're trying to remove something that might be hidden or protected, which isn't usual in normal operations.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is creating pipes and loading the Windows Defender Platform DLL. That seems a bit odd because I don't recall standard PowerShell scripts needing to create named pipes often. It makes me think of lateral movement techniques used by attackers to communicate with other processes or to hide their commands.\n\nLooking further, several events show file creation and registry modifications by powershell.exe and cmd.exe. These actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious, but when combined with the previous observations, they raise a flag. Attackers often clean up their tracks by deleting logs or files, which might explain why there are multiple Remove-Item commands.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run, which is typically used to check user permissions. However, in this context, it could be part of reconnaissance to gather system information or privileges. Additionally, the use of sc.exe to stop and delete services stands out. This could be an attempt to disable security-related services like antivirus or logging tools, which is a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nThe multiple registry accesses and modifications are another red flag. Attackers frequently modify the Windows Registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks makes me think this activity isn't just routine.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here: powershell.exe running scripts that delete files, creating pipes, accessing processes, and modifying the registry; cmd.exe being used to stop and delete services; and whoami.exe checking system details. These behaviors are indicative of malicious activities such as payload execution, persistence mechanisms, and attempts to evade detection by disabling security tools.\n\nI'm also noticing that several events involve the same processes and command-line arguments, which suggests a coordinated effort rather than random or unrelated actions. This batch of logs doesn't show the usual day-to-day system operations; instead, it looks like someone is trying to execute commands with persistence and possibly exfiltrate data or disrupt services.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the activities described in this log batch are highly suspicious. The combination of file deletions, registry modifications, service stops, and process creations points towards potential malicious behavior. There's a clear pattern that aligns with known attack tactics like persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated PowerShell command execution attempting to delete files, registry modifications, and service management which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.\n\nSo, I've got these JSONL events here, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be just one result with CLASSIFICATION, JUSTIFICATION, and CONFIDENCE. Got it.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all seem to be process-related events. For example:\n\n1. Powershell.exe accessed something.\n2. Registry value set by powershell.exe again.\n3. Cmd.exe was used with a command to delete a file in the temp directory.\n4. Another instance of powershell accessing something.\n\nHmm, I remember that PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag for malicious activities. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might indicate something suspicious, especially if combined with other actions like registry modifications and file operations.\n\nThen there are more events where cmd.exe sets registry values and deletes files. That could be normal admin work or part of an attack. Also, there's a whoami.exe process which is usually used to check user privileges—another tool that can be innocent but might have malicious intent when combined with other actions.\n\nOne event stands out: powershell.exe creating a file in the temp directory and then deleting it immediately. That seems odd. Creating and then deleting a script file quickly could be trying to avoid detection or execute something malicious without leaving traces. The filename has \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which sounds like it's related to script policy testing, but the path is specific to the user's temp folder.\n\nI also notice multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various .NET and clr files. That might be normal operation, but combined with other activities, it could indicate something more nefarious, especially if these modules are being used in a way that's not standard.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple process creations, registry modifications, file deletions, and quick script creation\/deletion—this pattern looks like possible signs of malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe with varied commands (some legitimate, others less so) could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this batch is interesting for investigation because the combination of events suggests potential suspicious behavior that could indicate an attempt at hiding traces or executing malicious scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing resources and modifying registry values, as well as cmd.exe deleting files in the temp directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That seems normal since it's part of the log management process. Then, powershell.exe is mentioned multiple times with various tasks like pipe creation and provider lifecycle events. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so repeated instances could be suspicious.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\" as the command line. That's unusual because it doesn't look like a typical script execution. This might indicate some form of obfuscation or an attempt to hide commands. Also, there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which could be part of establishing persistence or communication channels.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's odd because Defender should be a trusted process, but if Powershell is accessing it, it might be trying to bypass detection mechanisms. There are also file creation events in specific user directories, which could be setting up malicious profiles or storing configuration data.\n\nThere's an event where whoami.exe is run, which might be used by attackers to gather information about the system. Additionally, cmd.exe is deleting a file in the TEMP directory and modifying registry values. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up traces after malicious activities, especially if done with parameters like \/f (force) and \/q (quiet). Registry modifications could be for persistence or altering system configurations.\n\nCombining all these, I see multiple instances where Powershell is used with unusual command lines, file operations in user directories, deletion of files, and registry changes. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or lateral movement within a network. The repetition of these actions increases the suspicion level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including unusual PowerShell command lines, file deletions, and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of PowerShell activity here. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has so many capabilities.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. There are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessed and files are created. One file is 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\tarefa_comum.txt'. That path seems a bit generic, but not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\n2. I notice several instances where the command line argument is trying to remove a file: {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore}. This cmdlet deletes a log file in the TEMP directory and ignores any errors if it doesn't exist. Deleting files isn't inherently bad, but doing so with a script might be part of a larger operation.\n\n3. There are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks logged. I'm not too familiar with all the specifics, but these might relate to how PowerShell is handling different modules or providers. The repetition makes me think there's a script running that's causing multiple events.\n\n4. Registry value sets are happening. Modifying registry settings can be normal for configuration changes, but it's another sign of potentially script-driven activity.\n\n5. There are several image load events, all related to system32 and .NET framework components. This could be standard when running scripts or applications that require these libraries.\n\n6. A file is created in the Temp directory named '__PSScriptPolicyTest_0ysdkreo.yib.ps1' and then immediately deleted. Creating and deleting temporary script files is something a legitimate script might do, especially during testing or cleanup. However, it could also be part of an attempt to execute code without leaving evidence.\n\n7. There's a pipe created event. Named pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious but can be a vector for attacks if misused.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch shows repeated use of PowerShell with the same command line arguments, deletion of files in TEMP, creation and deletion of script files, and multiple provider\/lifecycle events. While each individual action might not be suspicious, the combination suggests a script is being executed that's trying to clean up traces or perform actions that could be malicious.\n\nI'm thinking about how attackers use PowerShell for persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The repeated attempts to remove files and the temporary script file are red flags. Also, the command line arguments look like they're part of a larger script designed to erase logs or evidence of their activity.\n\nSo, considering all these points together, this batch is likely interesting because it shows behavior that could be indicative of malicious activities, even though each event on its own isn't necessarily suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch indicates repeated PowerShell activity including file deletions and temporary script creation\/deletion, suggesting potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are a lot of PowerShell executions. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for malicious activities. The command lines show things like removing files in the TEMP directory and creating scripts which could be indicators of foul play.\n\nI notice several registry value sets by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to survive reboots. Also, multiple ImageLoad events for different DLLs might indicate that malicious code is loading various components or obfuscating its presence.\n\nThere's a file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory. The script named __PSScriptPolicyTest sounds suspicious—it could be a test script trying to bypass policies. The fact that it's deleted right after might mean it was executed and then cleaned up, which is common in attacks to cover tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events, which can allow communication between processes. This could be part of a larger attack chain where multiple components need to communicate securely.\n\nConsidering all these activities together—multiple PowerShell instances, file operations, registry modifications, and potential script execution—it paints a picture of possible malicious behavior. The repeated actions suggest an attempt to establish persistence or execute commands that shouldn't go unnoticed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell and system changes, which are definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with suspicious command lines, including attempts to remove files in the TEMP directory and create\/execute scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180711.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with an empty command line. That's a bit odd because usually when you run PowerShell from the command line, there's some command or script specified. Empty might mean it's just launching without doing much, but I remember that sometimes attackers use this technique to hide their commands or inject them later.\n\nThen, there are events where task is 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These seem related to Windows Defender processes. I think these are normal system activities when the antivirus scans or updates. But seeing multiple of these might be suspicious if they're happening too frequently or at odd times, but in this case, maybe it's just regular operation.\n\nNext, there's an event where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll from a specific path. That's within the Windows Defender directory, so that seems legitimate. Powershell often uses DLLs for functionality, especially when interacting with system components.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created in the user's AppData folder under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. I'm not too familiar with this specific location, but PowerShell does use profile files to store configurations or other data. If it's creating a new profile on startup, that could be normal, especially if the user is non-interactively logged in.\n\nThere are several events where Registry values are set and processes are accessed. These are common operations for legitimate software as well as malicious actors trying to maintain persistence or modify system settings. Without more context, it's hard to say if these actions are suspicious.\n\nI notice a few instances of whoami.exe being run. Whoami is often used in scripts to check user permissions or credentials. It's not inherently malicious, but repeated use could indicate something like privilege escalation attempts or simply script testing.\n\nThere are also events involving winlogbeat.exe, which I believe is part of the ELK stack for log management. It's creating a configuration file, which makes sense if it's being used to ship logs from this system. This doesn't seem concerning on its own.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events occur over a short period and involve multiple instances of powershell.exe and whoami.exe without clear justification, it could raise flags. The repeated process creations and file\/registry modifications might be part of a script or a malicious payload trying to establish persistence or gather information.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several indicators that could point towards potential malicious activity, such as repeated use of powershell.exe with empty command lines, whoami.exe executions, and creation of files in non-standard locations. These activities might be part of a larger campaign to gain access or move laterally within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with empty command lines, whoami.exe executions, and file\/registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, first, I'll go through each event one by one and look for patterns or anything that stands out.\n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe being accessed multiple times with ProcessAccess task. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it's also commonly used for legitimate admin tasks. However, the frequency might matter here. There are several entries of powershell.exe being accessed, which could indicate something suspicious like script execution or command injection.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe running multiple times. The command line shows it's just executing normally, so that in itself isn't too bad. But if it's called by another process, especially from PowerShell, it might be part of a larger chain of events.\n\nLooking at the 8th event, powershell.exe is accessing a registry value. That's interesting because modifying the registry can be a sign of malicious activity, like persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations. This adds to my concern about PowerShell being used inappropriately.\n\nThe ninth event again mentions ProcessAccess for PowerShell. It's just another instance of the same process, but combined with the previous events, it strengthens the idea that there's something unusual going on.\n\nThen there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so this seems normal unless it's doing something unexpected like accessing restricted files or running at odd times. In this case, it looks okay because the path seems standard.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell accesses, including registry modifications, and repeated whoami.exe executions. The repetition of ProcessAccess events might indicate a script running in a loop or some automated process that's trying to stay under the radar. Registry changes are particularly concerning as they can be used for persistence or system-wide configurations, which malicious actors often do.\n\nI'm also noticing that these events aren't isolated—there are several instances of the same processes being triggered within a short period. This clustering could suggest an attack campaign where multiple tools are used in sequence to achieve a goal. For example, using whoami.exe to gather information and PowerShell to execute commands or hide activities.\n\nThe confidence level here is pretty high because while each event on its own might not be suspicious enough, the combination of repeated PowerShell activity with registry modifications stands out as potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the number of events involving these processes increases the suspicion that it's not just normal user activity but something more targeted and possibly harmful.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing system resources and modifying registry values, along with repeated execution of whoami.exe, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
