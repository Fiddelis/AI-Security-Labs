{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event is a process named powershell.exe accessing something with ProcessAccess. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that catches my attention. Then there's whoami.exe being executed without any command line arguments. That's normal because it usually shows user info, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe access event. It seems like there are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing different things. Then there's a Registry value set by PowerShell. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware, which is suspicious.\n\nLooking at the fifth event, it's a ProcessCreate for powershell.exe with a command line that includes Compress-Archive. This cmdlet is often used to create zip files. The path in the command seems to point to specific directories like \"modulo_temporario\" and \"objeto_secundario\". That looks a bit fishy because the paths are not standard, which could indicate that they're trying to package some files without a clear legitimate reason.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell scripts as they load these libraries when running. Not too suspicious on their own, but combined with other events, it's something to note.\n\nThe 11th event shows a file being created in the TEMP directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1. The creation and then immediate deletion of this script is concerning because attackers might drop scripts temporarily to bypass certain policies or execute them without leaving a trace.\n\nFollowing that, several events show powershell.exe executing similar Compress-Archive commands with different paths. Each command seems to be trying to compress files from various \"modulo_temporario\" directories into zip files in the TEMP folder. The repeated use of \"-Force\" suggests they're overriding any existing files, which could indicate an automated process that might not be intended.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing the registry and creating\/deleting scripts in temp folders, along with compressing arbitrary files. These actions are often associated with malicious activities like lateral movement or data exfiltration. The use of Compress-Archive with specific paths could indicate an attempt to package sensitive information or to spread across systems. Therefore, this batch shows signs that might require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell accessing the registry and creating\/deleting scripts in temp folders, combined with compressing files from non-standard directories, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me start by going through each event one by one and then see if there's a pattern or something that stands out.\n\nThe first few events all involve powershell.exe with command lines that execute Compress-Archive commands. They're creating zip files in the TEMP directory. That's a bit concerning because Powershell is often used for malicious activities, but on its own, compressing files might not be suspicious. However, multiple such events could indicate something more.\n\nThen there are several events where powershell.exe is mentioned without specific command lines, just that it was executed or created a process. These are common and can be part of legitimate system operations, so maybe not too alarming yet.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see various Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Pipeline Execution Details, etc. These seem related to how Powershell is running scripts or modules. The file paths mentioned, like Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1, are standard Powershell modules, which doesn't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is usually for log management, so that's probably normal unless it's doing something unexpected elsewhere.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be interesting because startup scripts could potentially run malicious code at login, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value sets by different processes like powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and notepad.exe. While registry modifications can be part of legitimate software behavior, frequent changes or unusual locations could indicate malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that many events involve Powershell using the Compress-Archive cmdlet to create zip files in TEMP. Repeated use of this command might suggest data exfiltration, where an attacker is compressing and sending sensitive files out of the system. The fact that each event uses different paths but consistently creates a zip in TEMP could be a pattern worth investigating.\n\nThe presence of multiple Powershell processes accessing different modules and performing various lifecycle tasks makes me think there's a script running, possibly one that's attempting to stay persistent or perform multiple actions. The use of the Registry for setting values across different processes (powershell.exe, conhost.exe) might indicate an attempt to create persistence points or modify system configurations in a way that's not typical.\n\nOverall, while each individual event might not be highly suspicious on its own, the combination—especially the repeated Powershell commands creating zip files and multiple registry modifications—does raise some red flags. It could indicate data being packaged for exfiltration or an attempt to maintain persistence across reboots.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes compressing files into zip archives in TEMP directory, combined with registry modifications and other powershell activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be tricky because it's often used by legitimate services but also by malware to hide their activities. So multiple instances of Registry value sets might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're happening frequently.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems unusual because I don't recall Calculator needing such a module for its basic functions. Maybe it's trying to inject some code or load a DLL that could be malicious.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating files in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is an ELK Stack tool used for collecting logs, so this might just be normal if someone is setting it up. But the path seems specific and the filename has \".new\" which makes me think there might be a file being renamed or overwritten.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe also sets registry values. This process is related to Windows shell components, but again, seeing it perform registry writes could be part of legitimate operations, though it's worth monitoring if this happens too often.\n\nPowershell.exe shows up multiple times with both Registry value sets and Process accesses. Powershell is a powerful tool that can execute scripts and is often targeted by attackers for command-line executions. The repeated activity here raises a red flag because attackers might use it to run malicious commands or move laterally within the network.\n\nChrome.exe has several entries: some are registry writes, which could be part of its normal operation when updating settings, but others involve loading specific DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. While these are legitimate Windows modules, frequent loads might indicate something amiss, especially if they're part of exploit attempts.\n\nThere's also an entry for whoami.exe being run from the command line. Whoami is typically used to get user information, but in certain contexts, it can be a tool for reconnaissance or credential dumping. The fact that it's executed without any arguments seems suspicious; usually, it would have parameters if being used maliciously.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple processes writing to the registry (svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe), Powershell activity, and whoami execution are all points of interest. These could be signs of a potential attack or system compromise. The combination suggests possible exploit attempts or persistence mechanisms being established.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events repeat the same actions, which might indicate automated behavior or scripts running multiple times. This repetition isn't normal for standard user activities and could point towards malicious processes trying different methods to stay undetected or establish persistence.\n\nTaking into account all these factors—suspicious process activities, repeated writes to the registry, use of Powershell and whoami without clear benign context—the batch as a whole definitely stands out. While individual events might not be alarming on their own, together they form a pattern that's worth investigating for potential security issues.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, Powershell activity with ProcessAccess events, and an unusual Calculator.exe loading a DLL. These indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
