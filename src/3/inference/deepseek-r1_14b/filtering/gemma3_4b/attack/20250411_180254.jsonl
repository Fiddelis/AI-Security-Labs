Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst event: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal because browsers do that all the time. Not suspicious.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe making a registry change. PowerShell is commonly used, both benign and malicious, but a single registry access isn't enough to raise flags.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe running systeminfo and reg query. Systeminfo is standard for info gathering, and reg queries are common admin tasks. No red flags here.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe being accessed again. Still within normal usage if someone's using it for scripting or admin tasks.\n\nFifth event: another cmd.exe with registry changes. Again, could be part of system management scripts.\n\nSixth event: systeminfo.exe creating a process and loading AMSI.DLL. Wait, but then in the next event, it loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal because these are legitimate processes and DLLs used for various functions.\n\nSeventh event: notepad.exe making registry changes. Notepad is typically benign, though sometimes attackers might use it as a loader, but without more context, this isn't suspicious.\n\nEighth event: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a common tool; urlmon is part of Windows URL handling. Not concerning.\n\nNinth event: svchost.exe making registry changes and creating files in winevt logs. Svchost is a known legitimate process for various services, so these actions are standard unless they're out of place with other events.\n\nTenth event: WmiPrvSE.exe running as expected with wmiutils.dll. This is related to WMI, which can be used maliciously but in this case seems normal.\n\nEleventh and twelfth events: svchost creating files in winevt logs. Again, standard logging activities unless there's a pattern of excessive writes.\n\nThirteenth event: reg.exe querying the same registry key as before. Using reg query is common for information gathering, especially by scripts or admins.\n\nFourteenth event: conhost.exe making registry changes. Conhost is often used in command-line environments; no immediate issues here.\n\nFifteenth and sixteenth events: services.exe logon and a special logon without process name. Services.exe is part of Windows services, and the special logon could be related to service accounts or system processes.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these are normal user and system activities. There's no consistent pattern of malicious behavior across the logs. While some commands like using cmd.exe with reg queries can be part of attacks, there's no clear indication of an attack here. The events don't show any unusual combinations or repeated suspicious actions.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually and collectively, these events fall within normal system behavior without evidence of coordinated malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of common user activities such as browser usage, process creation, and registry operations which are typical in a standard computing environment. There is no indication of unusual or malicious behavior when considered collectively.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that the logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. The events involve different processes like winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and Calculator.exe.\n\nLooking at the tasks:\n- winlogbeat.exe is creating files. It's setting up some configuration file (winlogbeat.yml.new). Since this is likely part of the logging setup, it might be normal behavior unless there's something suspicious about the path or frequency.\n- ApplicationFrameHost.exe sets a registry value. This seems standard as Windows processes often interact with the registry for configuration.\n- powershell.exe sets a registry value and accesses another process. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but it can also be a vector for attacks. However, just accessing processes might not be malicious unless there's evidence of unauthorized access or script execution.\n- chrome.exe has multiple events: creating pipes, setting registry values, loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are normal operations for Chrome as it loads various components and interacts with system libraries. The repeated registry writes by chrome.exe could be updates or tracking usage data, which is typical.\n\nI also see that winlogbeat.exe creates a file at the same path twice, which might indicate an attempt to overwrite or duplicate a configuration file. However, without context on what's in the file content, it's hard to say if this is malicious. Similarly, powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'â€”this translates to \"default_object.txt\" in Portuguese. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with other actions by powershell.exe, it could be something to look into.\n\nBut considering all the events together, most of them are standard system activities. Chrome's frequent registry writes might be part of its update mechanism or telemetry. Powershell is often used legitimately, but so many registry changes could be a sign, though not necessarily malicious without more context. The winlogbeat.exe events seem like setup steps for logging.\n\nThere's no indication of failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or known malicious file hashes. Without anomalies like unusual files, network traffic, or process behavior beyond typical operations, the batch doesn't show clear signs of malicious activity. However, the volume of registry writes by Chrome could be worth monitoring if it's significantly higher than usual.\n\nOverall, while some actions are notable, they don't collectively indicate a breach or attack. They might be legitimate activities but could warrant closer inspection to ensure nothing is amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes and activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and process interactions without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I'm given a JSONL file with some log events, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The user mentioned it's about cybersecurity analysis, so I have to think like a specialist in that area.\n\nLooking at the event provided: {\"process\":\"{'name': 'chrome.exe'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}. Hmm, okay, so this is from Windows logs. The process name is chrome.exe, which is legitimate because Chrome is a common browser. But the task is about setting a registry value.\n\nI know that malicious actors often use registry modifications to persistence or change system configurations. So seeing Chrome set a registry value could be normal if it's part of its standard operation, like setting user preferences. But I'm not entirely sure what specific registry keys Chrome would modify. If this event shows an unusual registry path or happens at an unexpected time (like outside of regular updates), it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nAlso, the file field is None here, which probably means no file was accessed in this particular event. So the focus is purely on process and registry activity.\n\nConsidering all this, the single event doesn't provide enough context to be sure if it's malicious or just normal behavior. Since there's only one event in the batch mentioned, I have to decide based on that alone. Without more events showing unusual patterns or behaviors, it's hard to classify this as interesting. It could just be a legitimate Chrome update or user action.\n\nI think the confidence level should be low because while registry modifications can be malicious, they're also common in normal operations. So without additional context or multiple related events, I'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event involves a legitimate process (chrome.exe) performing a standard registry operation, which is not indicative of malicious activity in this context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
