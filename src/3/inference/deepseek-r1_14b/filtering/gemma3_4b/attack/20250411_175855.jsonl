Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal because browsers do that all the time. Then, MpDefenderCoreService.exe also connects, which makes sense as it's part of antivirus software monitoring networks.\n\nNext, I see several powershell.exe processes being accessed and modifying registry values. Powershell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a tool for attackers. The fact that it's accessing and setting registry entries might raise an eyebrow because such actions could be malicious.\n\nThere are cmd.exe instances running commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' followed by findstr looking for .key files. This seems suspicious because searching for keyfiles might indicate attempts to locate sensitive information or encryption keys, which is a red flag for potential data theft or ransomware activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple process creations and file operations, like creating a new winlogbeat.yml file and another text file named tarefa_geral.txt. The winlogbeat.exe is likely an ELK stack tool, so that's probably legitimate. However, the creation of random files by powershell or cmd could be part of malicious scripts.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple network connections from chrome, registry modifications with powershell and cmd, and file operations might indicate some level of suspicious activity, especially if these processes don't align with normal user behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation, network connections, and file operations involving potentially malicious tools like powershell.exe and cmd.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening. The first event shows that 'winlogbeat.exe' created a file at a specific path. That makes sense since winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting logs, so it's likely creating or updating its configuration files. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and various instances of 'svchost.exe' all performing registry value sets. Registry operations in themselves aren't unusual, especially since many legitimate processes interact with the Windows Registry for configuration settings. However, I'll keep an eye out if these activities seem excessive or if they're modifying sensitive areas of the registry.\n\nLooking further, there are events from 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' loading the 'urlmon.dll' file. While calc is a benign process, it's interesting that it's accessing urlmon.dll, which is related to URL parsing in Windows. This could be normal if the calculator is part of a script or has some embedded functionality, but it might also indicate something more malicious if there are multiple such events.\n\nThen, I notice several instances where 'powershell.exe' is involved. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators for legitimate tasks, but it's also commonly exploited in attacks due to its scripting capabilities. The event shows that powershell accessed processes and set registry values. This could be red flags depending on the context. However, without more information about what the script is doing, it might not necessarily be malicious.\n\nThere are a lot of events from 'chrome.exe' setting registry values and loading specific DLLs like 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. These DLLs are related to anti-malware scanning interfaces (AMSI) and Windows Defender's OAV engine. It's normal for legitimate processes to interact with these, especially when they're being monitored or updated. However, repeated attempts to load or modify these files could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures.\n\nPutting it all together, I see a variety of processes performing standard operationsâ€”file creation, registry modifications, and loading system DLLs. While some of these actions (like powershell and multiple chrome.exe events) might raise eyebrows in certain contexts, there's nothing overtly malicious evident here. The frequency seems high for some activities, like the 12 'Registry value set' events from chrome.exe, but without a clear pattern or other indicators of compromise (IoCs), it's hard to classify this batch as suspicious.\n\nI also consider that system logs can be noisy, especially with processes like svchost.exe, which are part of Windows services and often appear in logs due to their legitimate operations. The events involving winlogbeat.exe creating files might just be part of its normal operation cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several activities worth monitoring individually (especially powershell and chrome.exe), the entire batch doesn't present a clear or immediate threat. It's possible that these events are part of regular system operations or legitimate user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and loading standard DLLs by common processes like winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. There is no indication of malicious behavior or unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let me look through each event one by one and see what they're showing.\n\nThe first event has a process named powershell.exe. The task in the winlog is ProcessAccess, which means it's an access event related to a process. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be something to look into. But I don't have any additional context here about what exactly was done with PowerShell.\n\nThe second event is whoami.exe being executed. The command line shows that it's running as \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\". Whoami is a standard Windows tool used to display information about the current user, so this could be part of legitimate user activity or maybe part of an enumeration process by attackers trying to understand the system.\n\nThe third event again shows powershell.exe with ProcessAccess. So we have two instances where PowerShell was accessed within the same batch. Since it's a scriptable tool, multiple accesses might be concerning if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nNow, considering all these together: seeing whoami.exe run alongside multiple PowerShell accesses could indicate potential malicious behavior. Attackers often use such tools to gather information (like user credentials or system details) before moving on to more harmful actions. The repetition of the powershell.exe access might suggest scripting or automated activity, which raises suspicion.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps, user accounts involved, or other related events (such as file creations\/modifications), it's hard to be certain. But given that both PowerShell and whoami are involved, it's definitely worth investigating. So I'd classify this batch as interesting with a reasonable confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe access alongside execution of whoami.exe may indicate potential malicious activity such as system enumeration or persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
