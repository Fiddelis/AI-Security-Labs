I'm looking at each event and trying to understand the context.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that involve creating scheduled tasks. The commands are using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is typically a harmless app but can be malicious if run with elevated privileges. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the user group is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. This means these tasks will run at logon with high privileges, which is a red flag for potential persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe first six events show similar PowerShell commands creating different scheduled tasks with various names like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc. These task names don't seem to have any legitimate purpose and might be attempts to create multiple backdoors or persistence points.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is started without a command line, which could mean it's being used interactively or another script is involved. Following that, there are registry access events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or tracking changes to the system configuration.\n\nLooking at the file paths loaded by powershell.exe, mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are part of the .NET framework, so their loading isn't unusual on its own, but combined with other events, it might indicate that PowerShell is executing .NET-based code or scripts.\n\nConsidering all these together—the creation of multiple scheduled tasks using elevated privileges, repeated registry accesses, and script execution—it's highly indicative of potential malicious activity. These could be signs of a cyberattack attempting to establish persistence on the system, which would definitely merit further investigation.\n\nI'm confident enough that this batch shows signs of suspicious behavior, so I'd classify it as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and atlogon triggers suggest potential malicious activity for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine whether this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to consider all the events together and make a single judgment.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Event 1**: Powershell.exe loads an image (clr.dll). That seems normal because PowerShell often uses .NET components.\n2. **Event 2**: Another load from powershell.exe, this time mscorlib.ni.dll. Again, standard for .NET framework usage.\n3. **Event 3**: clrjit.dll loaded by Powershell.exe. This is part of the Just-In-Time compiler and is normal.\n4. **Event 4**: MpOAV.dll loaded by Powershell.exe. This file is related to Windows Defender's antivirus scanning. Not unusual, but it could be suspicious depending on context.\n5. **Event 5**: A file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Temporary script files are common, especially with PowerShell. However, scripts generated at runtime can sometimes indicate malicious activity, like avoiding detection by creating a new file each time.\n6. **Event 6**: The same file deleted immediately after creation. Deleting temporary files is normal, but the combination of creating and deleting within the same session might warrant closer look.\n7. **Event 7**: A pipe created in Powershell.exe. Named pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is common but could also be a vector for command injection or persistence.\n8. **Event 8**: Powershell.exe runs a script that creates a scheduled task called \"estrutura_auxiliar\". The command line has some red flags:\n   - It's using `Register-ScheduledTask` with parameters like `-RunLevel Highest`, which allows it to run with elevated privileges.\n   - The action is executing calc.exe, which in itself isn't malicious, but the way it's constructed might be suspicious. Malware often schedules tasks for persistence or privilege escalation.\n9. **Events 9-14**: These are from chrome.exe making several registry changes. While Chrome does modify the registry for settings and extensions, multiple such events without a clear pattern could indicate something amiss. Alternatively, it might just be normal behavior if they're setting user preferences.\n10. **Events 15-24**: Multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks with no process or file context. This is concerning because executing remote commands without proper justification can be a sign of unauthorized access or command-and-control activity.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch together:\n\n- The presence of Powershell.exe activities, especially creating and deleting temporary scripts, loading antivirus components (which could be an attempt to bypass detection), and setting up scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is suspicious.\n- The use of remote commands without context might indicate communication with external systems, which could be part of a C2 protocol.\n- While some events are normal, the combination points towards potential malicious activities. The Powershell script creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon as an Administrator suggests persistence and privilege escalation, common in attack chains.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence due to the indicators of potential malware or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious activities including Powershell.exe creating and deleting a temporary script file, loading antivirus-related DLLs, and setting up a scheduled task with elevated privileges. Additionally, multiple remote command executions raise concerns about potential unauthorized access or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to be an event with process info, windows logs, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have \"winlog\" as \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds suspicious because remote commands can be part of malicious activities. But wait, I should check if these are just legitimate remote operations or something else.\n\nThen there's an event where process is 'powershell.exe' with some command line parameters. The command seems to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon as an admin with highest privileges. That's definitely concerning because it looks like a persistence mechanism used by attackers to maintain access. Using PowerShell for such tasks is common in attacks.\n\nNext, I see WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll and svchost.exe making several registry changes. Svchost is often used by malware because it's a legitimate process that can be manipulated. The multiple registry writes might indicate configuration of malicious activities or persistence.\n\nThere are also events where files are created, like 'unidade_comum' in the Tasks folder. That name doesn't ring any bells, but creating such files without user interaction could be part of setting up a backdoor or persistence.\n\nLooking further down, there's another PowerShell event that writes to a file called 'entrada_principal.txt'. The path seems normal, but combining this with previous actions, it might be part of an attack chain. Additionally, Chrome accessing certain DLLs and registry edits could be unrelated or potentially indicators if they're out of the ordinary.\n\nThe last few entries are about installing winlogbeat, which is a legitimate tool for log management. So those events are probably not malicious but system-related.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern here: multiple remote command executions, scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, file and registry modifications, and suspicious PowerShell activity. These indicators collectively point towards potential malicious behavior rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potentially malicious activities such as scheduled task creation, remote command executions, and suspicious file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first eight events:\n- All of them have \"process\" as 'chrome.exe'.\n- The \"winlog\" field shows tasks related to registry value sets. So, Chrome is modifying some registry entries, which is normal because applications often do that for configuration.\n- There's no file information in these events, so it's just process and log activity.\n\nThe ninth event:\n- Process is still 'chrome.exe', but now the task is a DNS query. This makes sense as part of browsing behavior; Chrome would typically perform DNS lookups to navigate to websites.\n- No file involved here either.\n\nTenth event:\n- The process name changes to 'winlogbeat.exe'.\n- The task is 'File created' for a .yml.new file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log management, so creating configuration files isn't unusual.\n- File path seems standard; nothing suspicious here.\n\nEleventh event:\n- Process is 'powershell.exe', which immediately raises some flags because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously.\n- The task is again 'File created' for a text file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. The path is in the same Downloads folder as before.\n- Creating files with .txt extensions isn't inherently suspicious, but combined with the use of PowerShell, it could indicate script execution or other activities. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all events together:\n- Most events are normal user activity: Chrome setting registry values and making DNS queries.\n- The winlogbeat.exe creating a config file is expected behavior for log management tools.\n- The only event that stands out is the PowerShell creating a file. While PowerShell is a common tool, it's often used in scripting and can be a vector for malicious activities. Without additional context like timestamps or other related events, it's hard to assess if this is part of legitimate script execution or something more nefarious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the majority are normal activities. However, the presence of PowerShell creating a file could be a red flag. I should consider whether there's enough information to warrant investigation. Since only one event is out of place and there's no clear pattern or additional malicious indicators, my confidence isn't very high in this being an actual security issue.\n\nTherefore, after weighing all factors, I think the batch is not particularly interesting for further investigation unless more context emerges.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly normal user activity with Chrome modifying registry settings and performing DNS queries. The creation of files by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe doesn't indicate malicious behavior without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
