{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that stands out is the multiple entries from powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for malicious activities. I notice several instances where PowerShell processes are being created with command lines that might be obfuscated or doing unusual things.\n\nThe first event shows whoami.exe running, which in itself isn't suspicious, but it's followed by multiple process accesses and creations of PowerShell. The command line in one of the events is quite long and includes a path to a .ps1 file, which could indicate script execution. That's interesting because scripts can perform a wide range of actions, some of which might be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several Image Load events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs including mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are standard for PowerShell as it uses the .NET framework, but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or use these to execute code in memory.\n\nThere's a File Create event of a temporary file in the user's Temp directory, followed immediately by a File Delete logged event for the same file. This behavior is red flags because creating and then deleting a file quickly can be a way to test if script execution is allowed or to erase evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there are Registry value sets from both PowerShell and svchost.exe. Modifying registry entries without clear justification could indicate an attempt to persistence or change system configurations maliciously.\n\nWhile svchost.exe is legitimate and often used by services, the File Create event in the SoftwareDistribution directory might be part of Windows Update, but the combination with other suspicious activities makes it worth looking into.\n\nConsidering all these events together—multiple PowerShell invocations, script execution attempts, quick file creation\/deletion, and registry modifications—it seems like a potential indicator of malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some of these actions could be part of normal administrative tasks or legitimate scripts, but the combination raises concerns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with potential script execution and file operations suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events show processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and svchost.exe performing registry value sets. Registry modifications can be normal, especially during software installations or system updates. I don't see anything immediately suspicious here, but I'll keep an eye out for patterns.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. This is a bit concerning because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious commands. The path mentioned seems related to the user's profile, which might be standard, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen, I notice multiple instances of svchost.exe performing various tasks—registry writes, file creations, and image loads. Svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts services, so some activity from it isn't unusual. However, the number of events from this process could indicate something. The files being created are in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory, which might be part of system updates or patches.\n\nLooking further, several file creations under \"C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\" with various .dll and .exe files stand out. These paths don't immediately ring alarm bells, but they could be part of legitimate update processes. However, multiple similar events might suggest something is being installed or modified in bulk, which could warrant closer inspection.\n\nThere are also image load events for urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll by several processes, including svchost.exe, msedge webview2, and backgroundTaskHost.exe. These DLLs are part of Windows' URL handling and BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) components. Their use isn't inherently suspicious unless combined with other indicators.\n\nThe PowerShell process setting a registry value is another point to consider. While PowerShell is a common tool, certain registry modifications could be malicious. The justification here is that an attacker might try to hide their presence or enable persistence through the registry.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it's hard to say definitively if they're malicious without more context. However, the combination of multiple registry writes, file creations in system directories, and PowerShell usage raises some flags. These activities could be part of a legitimate process like an update or installation, but they might also indicate malicious behavior such as payload deployment or persistence mechanisms.\n\nMy confidence isn't very high because while there are red flags, it's possible these events are part of normal operations. I'll classify this batch as interesting due to the potential for malicious activities, especially the PowerShell usage and multiple file creations in system directories.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by svchost.exe, along with PowerShell activity, suggest potential malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, all the events involve svchost.exe, which is a common system process in Windows. It's part of the services host and runs various services. However, it's known that svchost.exe can be associated with malicious activities because attackers often use legitimate processes to hide their actions.\n\nLooking at the tasks: most are either 'Registry value set' or 'File created'. Registry modifications are common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. The files being created have paths like C:\\Windows\\Logs\\... and others under SoftwareDistribution and ServiceProfiles. These locations can be related to Windows Update, system services, or other legitimate activities.\n\nI notice multiple instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values repeatedly. Malware often uses the registry for persistence, so repeated writes could indicate suspicious activity. Additionally, the creation of files in these specific directories might not be typical unless the system is undergoing updates or certain services are running.\n\nHowever, since all events are under svchost.exe and the tasks are standard ones, it's hard to tell without more context if they're malicious. The number of repeated RegistryEvent tasks stands out as potentially concerning. While svchost.exe can perform these actions legitimately, multiple writes in a short period might warrant closer examination.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying the batch as INTERESTING because of the high frequency of registry modifications and file creations, which could be indicators of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe performing Registry value set operations and creating files in potentially suspicious locations may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I need to determine whether the given batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. The logs are provided in JSONL format, each representing an event with process information, Windows log task details, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. **svchost.exe** processes are involved. I know svchost is a common system process that hosts services, so it's not inherently malicious, but it can be used by malware if compromised.\n   \n2. The first event shows a registry value being set by svchost.exe. That could be normal for system services but might also indicate configuration changes by malicious software.\n\n3. Next, there are several file creation events under the path `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install`. Specifically, one of them is an executable named `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe`. This seems suspicious because it's a patch file being created in that directory, which might be part of a legitimate update process, but could also be indicative of malicious activity trying to hide or install components.\n\n4. Moving on to the **MpSigStub.exe** process, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating multiple files in temporary directories with long GUID-like filenames and extensions like `.vdm`. These might be part of normal operations for updating antivirus definitions, but again, if these processes are happening outside their usual patterns, they could indicate issues.\n\n5. There are multiple file creation events by `MpSigStub.exe`, each with different names, which seems repetitive. This repetition might not be a red flag on its own, but combined with the other activities, it's worth noting.\n\n6. The **setup.exe** process is creating several files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. These include executables like `ie_to_edge_stub.exe` and others. While setup.exe typically installs software, having multiple such files could be concerning if they're not part of a legitimate installation or update.\n\n7. There are events from **MsMpEng.exe**, which is another Windows Defender-related process, loading DLLs. This seems normal unless there's an unusual pattern in how these modules are being loaded.\n\n8. Lastly, the **RuntimeBroker.exe** and **powershell.exe** processes accessing registry values and other system areas could be normal administrative tasks or part of malicious scripts attempting to gain access.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm considering whether these events indicate malicious activity or if they're just part of legitimate operations. svchost.exe setting registry values and creating executables in non-standard directories, combined with the repetitive file creations by MpSigStub.exe, might suggest something is off. However, without more context on what's normal for this system, it's hard to be certain. It could still be legitimate updates or background processes.\n\nI also need to weigh how confident I am in each assessment. The main red flags are the creation of executable files in locations that aren't typical for software installations and the activities involving known system processes but outside their usual patterns. However, these might not necessarily indicate malicious intent without further evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes and Their Activities:**\n   - **svchost.exe:** Known for hosting services; suspicious if it creates or accesses unexpected files.\n   - **MpSigStub.exe, MsMpEng.exe:** Related to Windows Defender; their file creations could be normal but need context.\n   - **setup.exe:** Typically used for software installations; multiple file creations might indicate malicious activity.\n\n2. **Analyze File Paths and Creation Events:**\n   - Files created in `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution` by svchost.exe are concerning as they're not standard directories for legitimate updates.\n   - Temporary files with GUID-like names could be part of legitimate processes but also a tactic used by malware to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Check for Repetitive or Unusual Patterns:**\n   - Multiple file creation events by MpSigStub.exe in temporary directories might indicate an attempt to deploy malicious components repeatedly.\n\n4. **Consider the Context:**\n   - Without baseline data on normal activities, it's challenging to definitively label these as suspicious.\n   - Legitimate updates and system processes can sometimes mimic suspicious behaviors.\n\n5. **Assess Overall Likelihood of Malicious Activity:**\n   - The combination of svchost.exe modifying registry settings, creating executables in unusual locations, and the repetitive nature of file creations by MpSigStub.exe increases suspicion.\n   - However, there's not enough evidence to conclusively determine malicious intent without further investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, while there are several red flags such as suspicious file creation activities and registry modifications, these could potentially be explained by legitimate system processes or updates. To confirm whether this indicates malicious activity, it would be prudent to conduct a deeper investigation, including checking for additional indicators of compromise, reviewing baseline behaviors, and possibly deploying further monitoring tools.\n\n**Answer:** The batch of events is not definitively indicative of malicious activity but warrants closer monitoring and further investigation."}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. I notice that most of them involve 'powershell.exe' and some other processes like 'whoami.exe' and 'services.exe'. The tasks logged include things like process creation, file access, registry changes, image loading, and more.\n\nLooking at the first event, 'whoami.exe' is run, which seems pretty benign. It's a common utility to check user information. But then I see multiple entries of 'powershell.exe' accessing files and registry values. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nIn particular, one of the events shows 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the temporary directory: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1'. Creating scripts in temp directories can be suspicious because attackers often use such locations to execute malicious code.\n\nMoreover, right after creating this file, there's a log of deleting it. That seems odd because why create and then immediately delete a script? It might be an attempt to bypass certain security checks or leave no trace. Alternatively, it could be testing script execution policies, but in the context of multiple registry changes, it feels more suspicious.\n\nI also notice that 'powershell.exe' is loading several .NET framework components and Windows Defender files. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, the combination with other actions makes me think there's something more going on here.\n\nThe events involving 'services.exe' modifying the registry multiple times are another red flag. Services can be legitimate, but attackers often create or modify services to achieve persistence or perform malicious tasks at boot.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated PowerShell activity with file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and process creations that could indicate service installations. These actions are commonly seen in attack patterns for persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of events suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.85 because while each individual action might not be conclusive, the sequence and variety point towards something worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directories, registry modifications, and potential service installations, indicating possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. Each event has three fields: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that the process is 'tarefa_logico.exe' and the Windows log task is about an image being loaded (ImageLoad rule). The files involved are mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, and clrjit.dll. These all seem like standard .NET framework components. So, this process loading these modules doesn't immediately raise red flags—it looks like normal operation for a .NET application.\n\nNext, I notice an event where 'powershell.exe' creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory under the user's AppData folder. That might be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting and can be a vector for malicious activities. However, sometimes legitimate scripts use this too, so it's not conclusive yet.\n\nThen there are events where 'powershell.exe' sets registry values. The task description mentions RegistryEvent. Again, this could be normal admin activity or part of script execution, but I'm keeping an eye on it since registry modifications can be indicators of malicious behavior.\n\nThe next few entries are interesting because the process is None, and the Windows log task is Execute a Remote Command. This suggests that something outside the typical process is executing commands. The file paths point to PowerShell scripts located in 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. These paths look a bit generic but could be hiding malicious activities, especially since they're being executed via remote command execution.\n\nLooking deeper, several events show the same command line for powershell.exe, which includes importing a module from 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1' and invoking 'Invoke-entrada_principal'. The fact that the same script is being executed multiple times might indicate repeated attempts or part of a loop. Additionally, the use of error handling (try-catch) and waiting for 5 seconds could be signs of persistence or ensuring the script runs successfully without interruption.\n\nConsidering all these events together: there's a mix of normal .NET process activity and then a shift to PowerShell executing scripts from specific paths, including remote command execution. The repeated invocation of the same script is concerning because it might suggest a persistent threat or automated malicious activity trying to remain undetected.\n\nWhile isolated events might not be alarming, the combination—especially the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious scripting and repeated attempts at executing the same script—raises my confidence level that this batch is worth investigating further. There's a pattern here that could indicate an attack vector or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions involving scripts from specific paths and repeated attempts, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed. The command lines show scripts importing modules and creating services. Specifically, the script `componente_auxiliar.ps1` is mentioned several times. This script is being imported in one event and then used to execute a remote command in others.\n\nI notice that many of these events involve the same file path: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1`. The fact that this script is repeatedly used might indicate it's part of legitimate system operations or could be malicious. But seeing it used multiple times, especially in remote command executions, raises a red flag.\n\nThe tasks mentioned are things like \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\", which are common in Windows for service-related activities. However, the frequency here is high—nine events with similar PowerShell commands creating services named \"objeto_ativo\". Creating many services quickly could be part of a persistence mechanism or a way to run malicious code at startup.\n\nThere's also an initial event where a script tries to invoke `entrada_principal` and then sleeps for five seconds. This might be a setup step before deploying more actions, which is typical in attack chains.\n\nAnother point is that some events have \"None\" for the process, but files are being accessed. This suggests file operations without a corresponding process, which could mean the file is being executed by another means or there's an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple attempts to create services using the same script, remote command executions, and repeated PowerShell activity—it seems like this batch shows potential malicious behavior. The pattern isn't typical of normal system operations and looks more like a coordinated attack attempt.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts from the same file path, creating services, and remote command executions indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we have here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents an event with three fields: process, winlog, and file. The first thing that stands out is the repetition of similar entries. Most events are from \"Execute a Remote Command\" task in the winlog field, pointing to the same file path every time. That's C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1.\n\nI remember that when analyzing logs for potential security issues, repeated identical events can be a red flag. It could indicate automated behavior or script execution, which might be malicious. The fact that it's a PowerShell script (as indicated by .ps1) is concerning because many malware tools use PowerShell to execute commands and evade detection.\n\nAlso, there are a couple of entries where the process is \"services.exe\" with a Logon task. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack vector, like service-related attacks or privilege escalation.\n\nThe file path in the logs seems quite long and specific. Sometimes attackers use such paths to avoid being detected by standard monitoring tools that only check common directories. The fact that this script is being executed multiple times could mean that it's part of a loop or automated process, possibly dropping malware components or performing malicious tasks each time.\n\nI also notice that some events don't have a file path, but the majority do. This uniformity suggests either a legitimate script run multiple times for different reasons or an attack where the same script is being executed repeatedly as part of a payload delivery.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch seems suspicious. The repeated execution of the same script could be indicative of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. Additionally, the involvement of services.exe might hint at service-related attacks which are common in more sophisticated threats.\n\nWhile there's a chance that this could be part of normal system operations (like scheduled tasks), the high frequency and specific file path make it more likely to be malicious. I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because it meets several criteria for potential security incidents, even if individually some events might not seem suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated executions of the same PowerShell script suggest potential malicious activity.

The user is providing a batch of JSONL events and wants me to classify whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. They’ve specified that I should return only one result in a strict JSON format without any additional text.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each event in the JSONL data. Each line represents an individual log entry. Let's break down what each part of these logs means.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n- The \"process\" field is \"None\", which might mean that there's no associated process or it wasn't captured.\n- The \"winlog\" field has a task, such as 'Execute a Remote Command'. This suggests some kind of remote command execution.\n- The \"file\" path points to \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". That's a PowerShell script, which is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nI notice that the same file path appears multiple times in the logs. Repeated attempts to execute the same script could be suspicious. Malware often runs scripts repeatedly as part of its payload delivery or execution process.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where the task is 'Windows Update Agent'. That’s a legitimate Windows service, so that might not raise red flags on its own. But it's present only twice in the logs amidst many other entries.\n\nConsidering all events together, having multiple instances of remote command execution targeting the same script file is concerning. It could indicate an attempt to run malicious code or establish persistence. The repetition suggests something abnormal, as legitimate activities usually don't involve such repeated attempts, especially with a script that might be flagged for suspicious activity.\n\nI should also think about possible false positives. Could these logs be from a routine system check or scheduled task? Maybe, but the number of repeats and the specific file path make it less likely. Plus, the fact that some entries have 'Windows Update Agent' tasks doesn't change much because even legitimate processes can be part of an attack chain.\n\nTaking all this into account, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\". The repeated remote command executions on a script file are significant enough to warrant further investigation.
