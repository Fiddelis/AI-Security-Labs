Let's start by looking at each event one by one and then consider the entire batch.\n\nFirst event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal as part of Windows operations. Next, Notepad.exe doing the same—also standard. Then there's PowerShell accessing processes, which could be suspicious but not necessarily if it's legitimate use.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, that file path looks legitimate since it's in System32. Similarly, Calculator.exe and other system processes loading known DLLs don't raise red flags immediately.\n\nI notice multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process, but repeated registry writes could be concerning, especially if they're not part of normal operations.\n\nThere's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory—this seems like it could be log rotation or configuration, which is expected behavior.\n\nWhoami.exe running with no command line parameters is benign; it's often used to check user information. However, when cmd.exe runs a wmic process to delete notepad.exe, that stands out. WMIC commands are often used in scripting and can be malicious if used for deletion or other actions without proper context.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of PowerShell accessing processes. While PowerShell is a powerful tool, repeated ProcessAccess events might indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement, which could be signs of an attack.\n\nThe cmd.exe event using wmic to delete notepad.exe is particularly concerning because deleting processes can be part of hiding traces or disrupting system operations. Additionally, the WMIC.exe process loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll—urlmon is legitimate, but amsi is related to antivirus; maybe trying to bypass detection.\n\nPutting it all together, while some events are normal, others like the wmic deletion command, repeated registry writes by svchost, and multiple ProcessAccess events from PowerShell could indicate malicious activity. The combination suggests potential attack vectors or attempts at system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple potentially suspicious activities such as process deletions using wmic and cmd.exe, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and several ProcessAccess events from PowerShell, which could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

I'll go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's from WMIC.exe loading a DLL file. That's a bit concerning because WMIC is often used in malicious activities, especially when loading external modules. The file path looks legitimate, but the combination of WMIC and an MpOAV.dll might warrant closer look, as sometimes attackers replace or manipulate system files.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, and conhost.exe all showing registry value sets. While these processes can legitimately interact with the registry, repeated registry writes without a clear purpose could indicate script activity or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe events, they show process accesses and registry modifications. PowerShell is powerful but often abused by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts. The frequency of its use here might be a red flag.\n\nThe cmd.exe event that copies an exe file to replace sethc.exe catches my attention. This is suspicious because replacing system executables can create persistence points or allow privilege escalation. It's a common tactic in malware to overwrite these files for later execution.\n\nThere are also multiple schtasks.exe events deleting tasks. Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers to maintain persistence, so deleting them might be an attempt to remove traces of such activities or disrupt legitimate ones.\n\nConsidering all these together: WMIC with a DLL, repeated registry changes across different processes, PowerShell and cmd commands modifying system files, and task deletions. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity. While individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination points towards possible attack vectors like persistence, privilege escalation, or file replacement.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the multiple red flags across different processes and system interactions that together indicate a higher risk of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, process creations, and file operations involving potentially malicious tools like WMIC.exe, powershell.exe, and cmd.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The goal is to analyze all these together to see if any malicious behavior stands out.\n\nStarting with the first event: schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal since those are legitimate Windows processes for task scheduling.\n\nNext, svchost.exe interacting with registry events. Svchost is a common process that often handles services, so this could be normal unless there's something unusual about the registry changes.\n\nThen there's cmd.exe and conhost.exe making registry changes. Both are command-line tools; their use can vary but isn't inherently malicious. However, repeated or unexpected use might raise flags.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with process access and registry events. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for scripting and execution, so its presence could be concerning, especially if there's no clear benign reason for it to run.\n\nLooking further, whoami.exe being executed seems odd but not necessarily malicious on its own—it could just be checking user information. The command lines in some events show \"\/c\", which suggests cmd is executing a command and then terminating, possibly as part of automation or script execution.\n\nAnother thing I notice is chrome.exe interacting with registry values and loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are standard operations for browser processes, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nIn total, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and created, which might indicate suspicious activity. Additionally, the repeated use of cmd.exe and conhost.exe with registry modifications could be signs of configuration changes on the system, potentially part of malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nWhile each individual event doesn't necessarily point to something malicious, the combination—especially multiple powershell instances and registry modifications—could suggest a potential attack.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each line has information about a process, some Windows log task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to keep in mind. There are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with different command lines. Some of these commands seem to be checking if certain .bat files exist. For example, one command is checking \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\\" and others check various paths ending with script.bat. This could indicate that the script is trying to verify the presence of specific files or maybe attempting to execute them.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the Windows log, I see events like Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. The fact that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs (like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll) might be normal, but it's worth checking if these are legitimate or part of some malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe was used to set a registry value. Conhost.exe is another process that can be used in command-line attacks, often related to remote access tools like Meterpreter. The combination of powershell.exe and conhost.exe using registry modifications could be a red flag, as attackers might use such techniques to maintain persistence.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in the logs. I'm not entirely sure what that entails, but it seems related to how services or providers are being managed. If this activity is happening frequently and in conjunction with other suspicious processes, it could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nI also notice that some command lines in powershell.exe have escaped quotes and complex paths. This might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual intent of the script, which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks. Obfuscation makes it harder for defenders to detect malicious activities by making the code look less suspicious.\n\nThe fact that multiple .bat files are being checked suggests some form of conditional execution based on file presence. If these scripts are part of an infection process, they might be trying to execute different payloads depending on whether certain files exist. This could indicate a multi-stage attack where initial access is followed by payload delivery based on specific conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the logs show that powershell.exe is accessing other processes and registry keys. Such accesses can be legitimate for administration tasks but also can be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network. The combination with other activities might mean there's more going on than just routine scripting.\n\nI'm a bit concerned about the number of events involving powershell.exe and conhost.exe, especially since they're performing writes to the registry and accessing various files. These actions are often part of persistence mechanisms or installing backdoors, which are signs of potential malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the overall pattern—especially the repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines, modifications to the registry, and obfuscation techniques—raises concerns. This combination makes me think that this batch is likely interesting for investigation because it could indicate a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities with suspicious command lines checking for specific .bat files, registry modifications, and potential obfuscation techniques suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, a lot of the events are from powershell.exe. That's a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks loading various DLLs. Some of these paths look normal, like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll which are part of .NET framework. But I'm noticing that some are from different locations, like the Windows Defender directory. That could be suspicious if those files aren't supposed to load into PowerShell.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate event for a script file in the Temp folder: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. It creates and then deletes this file shortly after. This might indicate some kind of test or maybe an attempt to bypass certain policy checks by creating and deleting temporary scripts quickly.\n\nAnother FileCreate is for elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. Not sure what that signifies yet, but it's a benign-looking name. \n\nSwitching over to chrome.exe events: seven entries where Registry values are being set. That's a lot of registry activity from Chrome. While browsers do interact with the registry, this volume might be worth looking into because sometimes malware uses excessive registry writes for persistence or tracking.\n\nLooking back at powershell.exe, there are several instances where it's checking if certain files exist using Test-Path in the command line. This could be part of a script trying to determine if specific malicious scripts are present before proceeding with something else. It might be an attempt to check if they can execute without being detected.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event from powershell.exe, which suggests inter-process communication. That's common for legitimate purposes but can also be used by malware to hide commands or exfiltrate data.\n\nThe confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards potential malicious activity: repeated file operations with temporary scripts, registry modifications from Chrome that seem excessive, and PowerShell checking for specific files which might indicate an infection check.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including temporary script creation\/deletion, file checks, and excessive registry writes, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that many of them involve powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The command lines have a pattern where they create new items in .bat files and set content using 'dir' as the value. This seems like the creation of batch scripts which might be used for directory listings or other actions.\n\nSome events show tasks related to Process Create, Process Access, Registry changes, and Image Load events within powershell.exe. These are common when a script is running and interacting with the system, but they could also indicate malicious activity if the commands are suspicious.\n\nI also see repeated patterns in the command lines across multiple events. They're creating files in different directories but using similar structures, which might be part of a larger script or batch process. The use of 'New-Item' to create files and 'Set-Content' suggests file manipulation, which is something that could be malicious if it's trying to hide files or overwrite existing ones.\n\nThe events with 'Provider Lifecycle' task might indicate the creation or deletion of system components, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, combined with the powershell.exe activity, this could be a red flag for potential exploitation.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe performing file operations and interacting with system components. While not all such activities are malicious, the repeated pattern of creating .bat files with 'dir' commands might be part of a script that's attempting to create persistence or execute malicious code. The confidence level is around 0.7 because there are signs of potential malicious behavior, but without more context on what these scripts are doing, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating and writing to .bat files with 'dir' commands may indicate script execution or file manipulation activities worth investigating.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events related to PowerShell executions and some file and registry activities.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that create new files in various directories. For example, the command lines are using New-Item and Set-Content to write scripts into batch files. This seems a bit suspicious because creating files can be part of malicious activities like dropping payloads or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the file operations: there's a file being created in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a PowerShell script test file, and then it's immediately deleted. That could indicate an attempt to check if certain scripts are allowed by the system, possibly related to bypassing security policies. Also, other files like .bat scripts are being written into different directories which might be used for executing commands later.\n\nThe registry modifications caught my eye too. There are multiple entries where both powershell.exe and conhost.exe set registry values. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers often modify system configurations to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated loading of various DLLs like MpClient.dll, mscoree.dll, etc., by PowerShell. While these might be legitimate parts of the script execution process, it's worth checking if any of them are being loaded from unexpected paths, which could indicate malicious activity.\n\nI also notice that there are multiple events related to Process Create and Process Access. This could be part of a process injection technique or just standard scripting behavior. It's hard to tell without more context, but combined with the other activities, it adds to the concern.\n\nThe fact that conhost.exe is involved in setting a registry value is interesting too. Conhost.exe is often used by attackers as a legitimate-looking process for command-line tools, making it harder to detect malicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions creating files, deleting test scripts, modifying the registry, and loading various system components could be signs of an attacker testing the environment or setting up persistence mechanisms. These activities don't seem to have clear benign explanations, especially when combined with the deletion of temporary script files which might indicate an attempt to clean up traces.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and multiple PowerShell executions could be indicative of malicious behavior.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell is being executed with commands that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The command lines are variations of checking paths like \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\\" and so on. This repeated pattern seems suspicious because it looks like they're trying to verify if specific scripts exist, possibly before executing them. If these scripts were malicious, this could be a way to ensure they're present or download them.\n\nNext, there are events where PowerShell creates temporary files in the user's AppData directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1. Creating and then deleting such files quickly might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace after execution. This behavior is often seen in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also events related to loading DLLs from Windows Defender's directory. While Defender itself is a legitimate process, having other scripts load these could indicate attempts to hide malicious activities or use legitimate processes for malicious purposes (living off the land techniques).\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, but creating files without proper authorization could be concerning if not explained by normal operations.\n\nLooking at other events, there are registry writes and process accesses logged. These actions can be common in both legitimate and malicious activities, but when combined with the previous points, they raise suspicion.\n\nThe overall pattern suggests a possible script or batch file execution attempt with checks for certain files, quick creation\/deletion of temp files, and potential manipulation of system processes. This combination is not typical of normal user activity and could indicate an attack or unauthorized access.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting because the behaviors observed are indicative of potential malicious activities. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But based on the given data, there are several red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with file checks and temporary file creation\/deletion patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events involving 'whoami.exe' and 'powershell.exe'. The initial log shows 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a standard command used to display user information. Usually, this isn't malicious on its own but could be part of legitimate activity or reconnaissance.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries where PowerShell is accessed with different command lines. Each command line seems to check the existence of specific files in various paths on the system. For example, \"if (Test-Path \\\"C:\\\\pacote_principal\\\\objeto_base\\\\estrutura_secundario\\\\bin\\\\entrada_base.exe\\\") {exit 0} else {exit 1}}\". This pattern repeats several times with different file paths. The consistent use of Test-Path suggests the script is checking for certain files.\n\nI'm curious about what these file checks imply. If an attacker is trying to see if specific malicious files exist, it might be part of a larger script or payload deployment. Alternatively, it could be legitimate system administration tasks checking for configuration files.\n\nLooking at the event types, some are 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set', which are common in both benign and malicious activities. However, the repeated use of these actions with varying file paths raises suspicion. The presence of multiple registry access events might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or hide traces.\n\nAnother point is the loading of several .NET framework components by PowerShell. This isn't unusual, but it's worth noting because some attacks load malicious libraries. However, without seeing actual attempts to execute or modify these loaded modules, it's hard to say if this is part of an attack.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's a pattern of repeated file checks across different directories. While each check individually might not be concerning, the combination could indicate an attempt to map out the system for later attacks, such as dropping files into specific locations or executing them. This behavior is often seen in reconnaissance or early stages of malicious activities.\n\nOn the other hand, these actions could also be from a script testing environment setup or configuration validation. To confirm, more context like timestamps and user identities would help, but they aren't provided here.\n\nGiven the repeated file access checks by PowerShell, especially across multiple paths, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting for investigation.

I'm trying to figure out if they indicate any malicious activity or if they're just normal system operations.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. That's not unusual because PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and potentially malicious ones. So I need to dig deeper into what these specific events show.\n\nLooking at the first event: It says 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which sounds like it's related to Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender would load its own components. The next two entries create and then delete a file in the Temp directory, __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1. This could be part of script validation checks by PowerShell itself.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is checking if certain executables exist using Test-Path. These exit codes (0 or 1) might be part of a script's initialization, ensuring required files are present before proceeding. That sounds like standard behavior for scripts setting up their environment.\n\nThere are also registry access and process access events, which could be normal as scripts interact with system configurations. The creation of profile data in the StartupProfileData directory is another common activity during PowerShell execution.\n\nThe cmd.exe and whoami.exe processes caught my attention too. Using whoami to check user permissions or cmd for executing commands isn't inherently bad, but it's something to monitor. However, looking at their command lines, they seem to be part of basic checks or initial setup steps, not malicious actions like privilege escalation.\n\nPutting it all together, the events are mostly about PowerShell initializing scripts, checking file existence, accessing system resources, and some basic process executions. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known malicious behavior patterns. These look like legitimate operations, possibly from a script that's setting up its environment before performing other tasks.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being not interesting because the activities are within normal operational parameters for a system using PowerShell and related tools.

Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers, so that catches my attention immediately.\n\nLooking at the first event: it's Image loaded for MpOAV.dll in Windows Defender. That seems normal since Defender uses these DLLs. But then the next event shows a file created in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. Creating temp files is common, but having a PowerShell script there might be suspicious.\n\nThe third event deletes that same script. So it's creating and immediately deleting a script. That behavior can be a sign of malicious activity because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses different registry keys or other processes. This could indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation, which is concerning.\n\nMultiple command lines in the events check for specific files (like Get-Keystrokes.ps1) and exit if they don't find them. This might be part of a script that's trying to ensure it has all necessary components before executing malicious code.\n\nI also see 'whoami.exe' being run, which is another red flag because it can reveal user information, potentially aiding in lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe repetitive checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 make me think it's part of an attempt to gather keystrokes or perform other malicious activities.

This behavior is suspicious because it might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies by creating a temporary script, running it, and then deleting evidence.\n\nLooking at the file paths, I see references to `mscoree.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, and other .NET framework components being loaded. While this is normal for PowerShell execution, in combination with the other activities, it could suggest that malicious scripts are loading additional modules or obfuscating their presence.\n\nThe events also show multiple instances where the process accesses itself (`Process accessed` tasks). This might be an attempt to check if the script is running under certain conditions or if monitoring tools are active.\n\nFurthermore, there's a `Pipe Created` event. PowerShell often uses pipes for communication between processes, but in this case, it could be part of a larger malicious activity, such as creating a backdoor or communicating with another process.\n\nI also notice that some events mention tasks like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These are related to the initialization and termination of PowerShell components. If these events occur alongside other suspicious activities, they might indicate the script is trying to load modules or initialize certain functionalities that could be harmful.\n\nAnother thing is the consistency in command lines across different events. Each time `powershell.exe` is run, it's using similar conditional checks but with slightly varied paths. This suggests a pattern where the attacker is checking for specific files in multiple locations, which might be an attempt to avoid detection or ensure persistence across different directories.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple attempts (different command lines) trying to access the same kind of script (\"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\") indicates potential retry logic. If one path doesn't have the script, it's trying another, which could mean it's part of a more sophisticated attack where the malware is checking in multiple locations for its payload.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a configuration file. While this might be unrelated, it's worth noting that if winlogbeat is running unusual activities or being used to log events, it could potentially interfere with security monitoring, though without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell executions with conditional checks on script existence, temporary file creation and deletion, loading various .NET components, process access attempts, and pipe creation. These behaviors collectively suggest a potential malicious activity such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within the network. The confidence is high because the combination of events points to indicators commonly associated with cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity, making them highly interesting for investigation.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:**\n   - Several `powershell.exe` instances are observed, each executing commands that check for the existence of specific `.ps1` files (e.g., `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`). This pattern suggests an attempt to run a script and may indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary file is created and immediately deleted, possibly to evade detection or remove traces of executed code.\n\n3. **File Path Variations:**\n   - Different command lines check for scripts in various directories, indicating potential persistence attempts across multiple locations.\n\n4. **Process Access and Pipe Creation:**\n   - Processes accessing themselves and creating pipes may be establishing communication channels, potentially for malicious purposes like backdoors.\n\n5. **.NET Components Loading:**\n   - Loading of .NET modules might be part of script execution or obfuscation techniques to hide malicious activities.\n\n6. **Event Consistency:**\n   - The repeated nature of command lines suggests a structured approach, possibly indicating a more sophisticated attack with retry logic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of these events strongly points to potential malicious activity, such as script execution, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network. Given the high confidence in these indicators, further investigation is warranted to assess the extent and impact of such activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where `powershell.exe` is running with various activities like file creation and registry modifications. Powershell can be a red flag because it's often used in scripting attacks. But sometimes legitimate scripts use it too. I should note how many times it appears and what actions it's taking.\n\nNext, I see several instances of `whoami.exe` being executed. It's a common tool for checking user information, but it might also be used by attackers to gather system details. However, without context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are events where `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, and other benign applications like `winlogbeat.exe` are running. These don't raise any immediate red flags on their own.\n\nLooking at the network activities, both `chrome.exe` and `svchost.exe` have multiple network connection attempts and DNS queries. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that can handle network traffic, frequent connections might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're to unknown domains.\n\nThe registry modifications by powershell.exe and svchost.exe could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Modifying the registry is a common tactic for attackers to maintain access or ensure their malicious code runs at startup.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with file and registry operations, combined with the network activities from chrome.exe and svchost.exe, suggests potential malicious behavior. While some events could be normal, the overall pattern raises concerns about possible compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including file creation, registry modifications, and process access, alongside network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. These could indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each representing some system activity. My task is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there's chrome.exe, whoami.exe, but mostly powershell.exe. PowerShell is often used by admins for legitimate tasks, but it can also be a red flag because attackers might use it for malicious scripts.\n\nNow, let me go through each event:\n\n1. The first event is Chrome doing a DNS query. That's normal; browsers do that all the time.\n2. Next, powershell.exe accessing something. Not sure what yet, but powershell can do many things.\n3. Then whoami.exe runs without any arguments, which usually just tells you the current user. Probably not malicious on its own.\n4. Powershell again accessed, maybe running a script or command.\n5. Another access by powershell, and this time it set a registry value. That's interesting because changing registry settings can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n6. Here, powershell is creating a process with some commands: ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse. Wait, that looks like it's listing directories recursively. Maybe enumerating files or directories. It could be part of data collection for later exfiltration.\n7. Powershell accessed again, and now there are multiple image load events. These are DLLs being loaded by powershell, which is normal if they're legitimate libraries. But sometimes attackers load malicious ones.\n8. Another file creation event: a PowerShell script in the temp directory. The filename looks like it's part of some test, maybe related to script policy testing. Then immediately after creating it, it deletes the same file. That seems odd because why create and delete a script you just wrote? Maybe trying to bypass certain security policies or leaving no trace.\n9. Pipe Created events in powershell: communication between processes could be normal but can also be used for command and control.\n10-15: Multiple provider lifecycle events from the same command line as before, which is the powershell script with ls commands.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of powershell activity. The creation and deletion of a temp script file in quick succession might indicate an attempt to execute something without leaving evidence. Also, the repeated process creations with similar commands could be part of a larger campaign, maybe attempting to gather information across the network or system.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because of the powershell activities, especially the file creation and deletion which could be hiding malicious actions. The confidence is about 0.8 because while some activities are suspicious, they might also be legitimate admin tasks. But given the combination, it's better to flag for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell instances executing commands that could indicate malicious activity, including creating and deleting a script file in quick succession.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this batch of events. I'm looking for signs of malicious activity by checking process commands and file interactions.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with commands like `ls -recurse` and `get-childitem -recurse`. These commands list files recursively, which could be part of data collection or lateral movement. Repeated use might indicate an attempt to gather information across the system.\n\nAdditionally, some events show file creations in different locations. For instance, a `.txt` file is created in the Downloads folder. While this isn't inherently suspicious on its own, combined with other activities like registry changes and repeated process access, it raises concern about potential data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe events also involve `winlogbeat.exe`, which is legitimate software for log management. However, seeing multiple file creations by this process in the same location might indicate tampering or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\nThere are several registry value modifications detected through `RegistryEvent`. This can be a red flag because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or change system configurations.\n\nFurthermore, there's an event where a DLL is loaded (`MpClient.dll`), which could potentially indicate malicious activity if it's part of a payload or used to execute additional commands. However, since this file is related to Microsoft Defender, it might not be suspicious unless it's being accessed abnormally.\n\nConsidering all these points together—multiple PowerShell executions with file enumeration, repeated registry modifications, and unexpected file creations—the batch shows patterns that could indicate malicious behavior. While some activities are benign on their own, the combination suggests a possible attack or unauthorized system access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', along with file creation events and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
