{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got a bunch of system log events to analyze and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **MicrosoftEdge_X64...** creating a file named setup.exe. That seems normal because Edge updates might create temporary files during installation.\n2. The same process changes the creation time of that setup.exe file. Hmm, why would it change the timestamp? Maybe just part of the update process, but could also be something fishy like tampering evidence.\n3. CompatTelRunner.exe loading amsi.dll – I know amsi is related to anti-malware scanning interface, so this is standard for defender components.\n4. It loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which makes sense as that's part of the security suite.\n5. setup.exe creates a pipe event. Pipes are often used for communication between processes, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n6. services.exe and logon events – these are standard system processes starting up, nothing unusual here.\n7. Multiple entries with User Account Management: these are typically about user login\/logoff or account changes, which are common in logs but could indicate activity like credential dumping.\n8. Powershell being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command they're running looks for .inf files and checks if they have a specific section. That's interesting because .inf files can be used for malicious purposes, especially if they're trying to detect or extract information from them. Using powershell in restricted mode might be an attempt to avoid detection while still performing some actions.\n9. svchost.exe setting registry values – svchost is often a red flag because it's a generic process that can host many services, including malicious ones. Modifying the registry could indicate persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\nPutting this all together: The batch includes legitimate system processes like Edge updates and Defender components, which are expected. However, the powershell command and svchost activity stand out. The powershell script checking .inf files might be trying to identify potential attack vectors or malicious configurations. Combined with svchost's registry changes, there's a possibility of something not quite right.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because some activities could indicate malicious behavior, like using powershell in restricted mode for file operations and svchost modifying the registry. However, without more context or evidence of direct malicious outcomes, the confidence isn't extremely high, but it's definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events that may indicate potential malicious activity, such as powershell.exe executing commands and svchost.exe modifying registry values.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the entire batch of system log events provided is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's from winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... That seems normal since winlogbeat is likely part of the logging setup.\n\nNext, two events from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, so these could be legitimate. I'll keep an eye on how many such events there are and if they seem out of place.\n\nThen, Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll sounds normal. Urlmon is part of Windows for handling URLs, so that's expected.\n\nThe fifth event is svchost.exe creating a process with the command line parameters including -k LocalService. That also looks standard, as some services run under svchost with specific parameters.\n\nChrome.exe setting a registry value again—nothing unusual there; many processes interact with the registry for configuration.\n\nMsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll is normal since it's part of Windows Defender related processes.\n\nAnother winlogbeat file creation event—this seems repetitive but not suspicious on its own.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe loading taskschd.dll, which again is a standard Windows component, so that's okay.\n\nNext, svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization paths. This could be related to Windows updates or delivery optimization features, so it's legitimate unless the file names look odd. The file paths seem normal.\n\nLooking at MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe both creating and deleting files. It's handling an update, which is expected behavior. The deletion of a temp file also makes sense during the update process.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading Defender-related DLLs—this aligns with Windows Defender activities. Creating a lock file in Temp might be part of its operation to prevent multiple instances.\n\nConhost.exe and mintty.exe setting registry values. These are typically used for hosting console windows, so their actions here don't raise flags unless they're doing something unexpected.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events involve standard system processes performing normal operations like creating files, loading DLLs, or interacting with the registry. There's a lot of activity from svchost.exe and Defender-related processes, which can be typical on any Windows machine. The only thing that catches my eye is multiple file creation events in the same location by svchost.exe, but without additional context indicating unusual paths or volumes of writes, it doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nI don't see signs of malware like unexpected processes, strange network activity, or hidden files. All actions are consistent with legitimate system operations and common software behaviors. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, file operations, and registry interactions by known processes like svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, and Windows Defender components.

I'm seeing several entries where the process is \"MpCmdRun.exe\" and others where it's \"git.exe\". The tasks mentioned are either \"Image loaded\" or \"File created\", which seems pretty standard for these processes.\n\nStarting with \"MpCmdRun.exe\", I know that this is part of Windows Defender, a legitimate antivirus tool. Its logs about loading images like MpClient.dll and MpCommu.dll are typical activities for such a process. No red flags there.\n\nNow looking at the \"git.exe\" entries, they're all related to creating files in a node_modules directory, specifically within a folder named after a course called \"Qualidade de Software\". The paths point to JavaScript files inside semver's functions and classes. This seems like someone is working on a Node.js project, possibly setting up dependencies or modules. Since the user name \"fiddelis\" is part of the path, it might be personal development work.\n\nPutting this together, there's nothing unusual here. The events don't indicate any malicious behavior.

So, all these JSON objects are system logs from Windows, each indicating that a file was created by the process \"git.exe\". The paths listed are all within a node_modules folder for semver functions.\n\nFirst off, git is a version control tool often used in software development. When you clone a repository or perform certain operations like checkout, git might create files or directories as part of its normal operation. The fact that multiple files are being created under node_modules\/semver suggests this could be related to installing or updating a Node.js package, possibly during a build process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all inside \"node_modules\" which is standard for JavaScript packages. The specific files like major.js, minor.js, etc., are typical parts of the semver (semantic versioning) library. So, git.exe creating these files might be part of fetching or updating dependencies in a project.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file names, locations outside the expected node_modules structure, or other red flags like file deletions or accesses to sensitive areas. It seems entirely consistent with normal software development activities.\n\nTherefore, while each event is technically an action that could be monitored, taken together they don't indicate anything suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event, they all have similar fields: process, winlog, and file. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which tells me it's related to Git, a version control system. The winlog task is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The file paths are all within the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\semver\\...\n\nSo, what's happening here? It seems like Git is creating multiple files in a node_modules folder under semver. Node modules are standard in JavaScript\/Node.js projects because they contain third-party libraries. Semver specifically stands for semantic versioning, which is a tool used to verify that version numbers make sense.\n\nNow, why would Git be involved in creating these files? Well, when you clone a repository or pull updates using Git, it's common for the process to download and install dependencies, including node_modules. So, if someone is working on a project that uses Node.js, Git might trigger the installation of these modules as part of the setup.\n\nI should consider whether this activity is normal. Given that Git is often used in development environments and node_modules are standard in such setups, it's likely benign. These events don't show any signs of malicious behavior like access to sensitive files, unusual process names, or deviations from expected paths. The repeated file creations under a well-known module directory suggest routine operations rather than something suspicious.\n\nAre there any red flags? None that I can see. All the file paths are within expected project directories, and the process is associated with Git, which is a legitimate tool. There's no indication of unusual timing, multiple failed attempts, or other anomalies that might hint at a breach or attack.\n\nI should also think about confidence levels. Since all events follow a consistent pattern without any variations, my confidence in classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" is quite high. There's minimal risk of these being related to malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Git creating multiple files within a node_modules directory, which is typical during project setup or dependency installations.

I've been given a set of JSONL events where each line is an event involving the creation of files by \"git.exe\". The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of each event. Each has a process name as \"git.exe\", which means it's related to Git operations. The task in winlog is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The paths all point to files within node_modules directories under a user's Downloads folder, specifically for a course titled \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\".\n\nI'm thinking about what's normal here. When developers work on projects using Node.js, they often clone repositories which include node_modules folders. Git is used for version control, and during the setup process, new files are created as part of initializing the repository or installing dependencies. The files being created are typical for a node_modules directory: package.json, index.js, README.md, LICENSE, etc.\n\nThe repetition of similar events makes me think this could be part of an installation or build process where multiple files are being set up. There's nothing unusual about Git creating these files during development work. Since all the paths are within expected directories and the actions are standard for a Node.js project setup, I don't see any signs of malicious activity here.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything missing that might raise flags. For example, if some of the created files were known to be malicious or if they were being accessed in an unusual way. But in this case, it's just the creation of standard files related to Node modules and Git repositories.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, this batch doesn't seem to indicate any suspicious behavior. It looks like normal development activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show file creations by git.exe within node_modules directories, which is typical during project setup or dependency installations and does not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All these events are happening in the same directory path, which points to various files in different node_modules folders.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that git.exe is commonly used for version control. When you clone a repository or install Node.js packages, Git can create or update files automatically. The file paths mentioned look like they're part of a typical Node.js project setup. For example, there are files like package.json, index.js, and README.md, which are standard in such projects.\n\nThe repetition of the same process name and similar tasks makes me think this is normal activity during development. It's likely that someone is working on a project using Node.js, and Git is being used to manage changes or dependencies. The files being created are all part of setting up modules, which is something developers do regularly when initializing new projects or adding packages.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown processes, or writes to sensitive directories. All the paths are within a user's Downloads folder and specific to their course on \"Qualidade de Software\", which suggests it's related to their studies.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, this batch doesn't seem suspicious.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each event is about a file being created by git.exe in a specific path on a Windows system. The user provided 15 such events.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the events have the same process name, which is git.exe. That's common when dealing with version control systems like Git. The task in each log entry mentions \"File created\" and refers to a rule called FileCreate. So these are file creation events being logged.\n\nThe files being created are all located under the node_modules directory of a folder named after a course: \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". This looks like it's part of a Node.js project setup, given the presence of node_modules. The specific paths include various files and subdirectories typical for npm packages—like package.json, index.js, test directories, README.md, etc.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within the side-channel and shebang-regex directories under node_modules. These are likely dependencies being installed as part of a project. It's normal during development or setup to have multiple files created in such a manner when installing or updating packages using npm.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is involved suggests this might be part of a build process or deployment where files are being checked out or updated via Git. The creation of these files could also be part of an automated workflow, like CI\/CD pipelines, where code and dependencies are fetched and set up.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's nothing indicating unauthorized access, encryption of files, deletion, or other indicators of compromise. All the activities seem to revolve around legitimate file operations related to software development.\n\nIt's possible that these events could be part of a routine update or installation process for the project, which is why multiple files are being created in quick succession. The presence of standard files and directories supports this interpretation.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure this isn't malicious because it's all within expected behavior for a development environment using Git and Node.js.

The tasks are consistently labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate),\" indicating that files were created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different locations within a node_modules directory for \"sshpk.\" For example, one event is creating \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\sshpk\\\\bin\\\\sshpk-sign\" and similar others. These paths seem to be part of a Node.js module structure, which makes sense because Git is often used in development environments where such modules are common.\n\nSo each event is a file being created by the Git process within this specific directory. Since they're all happening under node_modules\/sshpk, it seems like Git is cloning or pulling a repository that includes this module, or perhaps installing dependencies via npm which would involve creating these files as part of the package installation.\n\nNow, considering whether these events are interesting: typically, when developers work with Git and Node modules, such file creation events are normal. They don't indicate any unusual activity like access to restricted areas, failed login attempts, or unexpected process executions. There's no sign of errors or exceptions in the logs; it's all successful file creations.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's anything suspicious about the files being created. The paths include \"sshpk,\" which is a library related to SSH key generation and management. But since this is part of a Node.js module, it's standard for such tools to be present in development environments. There’s no evidence that these files are being accessed improperly or used maliciously.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if all events are within a short period, they might indicate a batch operation like an npm install, which would be expected and not unusual. If they were spread out over time without a clear pattern, it might raise more questions, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlso, considering the user context, \"fiddelis\" is the username in the path. It suggests this is a local user account on their machine, which aligns with typical development activity rather than an external attacker.\n\nIn summary, all events are related to normal Git and Node.js operations within a user's development environment.

Let me start by looking at the data.\n\nEach event is a JSON object with three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"git.exe\", which suggests Git-related activity. The winlog indicates that a file was created, triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths all point to various JavaScript files within the node_modules directory of a project named \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\".\n\nSo, these events are showing multiple file creation actions performed by Git. Node_modules is a standard folder in npm-based projects where third-party libraries are stored. It's common for Git to interact with these files during operations like cloning repositories or installing dependencies.\n\nI should consider the context of each event. Since all events involve the same process and similar file paths, it seems like part of a normal software development workflow. There's no indication of unusual activity such as access to restricted areas, multiple failed login attempts, or changes in user permissions. The files being created are standard library files for a project.\n\nI should also think about whether this kind of activity is typical. Developers using Git often clone repositories which involve creating many files, especially in node_modules if they're using npm packages. So, seeing several file creation events from Git in that directory doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nLooking at the number of events—16 in total—it's a considerable amount but still within what could be expected during an initial checkout or after a significant update. There's no pattern suggesting malicious behavior like repeated attempts on the same file or unusual times (e.g., late at night).\n\nI should also check if there are any anomalies. The user account is \"fiddelis\", which seems to be a standard username, not something like a service account or an automated process that might warrant closer scrutiny. All file paths follow a logical structure without any hidden folders or executable files outside the node_modules.\n\nAnother point is the consistency of the events. Each event has the same structure and origin, which is typical for legitimate operations rather than malicious ones that often show varied and inconsistent patterns to evade detection.\n\nIn summary, these events appear to be part of normal Git operations within a development environment. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or suspicious activities. Therefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup and does not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each line is a JSON object representing an event on a Windows system. The key components in each event are the process name, the type of Windows log task, and file information.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that all these events have the same process name: \"git.exe\". Git is commonly used for version control, so it's not unusual to see it creating files. The task in each case is labeled as \"File created\" with a specific rule called \"FileCreate\". This suggests that multiple files are being created during this process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different JavaScript files within a \"node_modules\" directory. Specifically, the path is: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\" followed by various filenames like fromJSON.js, func.js, etc.\n\nSince these events are all happening under the node_modules folder, it's likely related to a Node.js application or module installation. The tcomb library is a popular npm package used for type checking in JavaScript applications. Installing or updating dependencies via npm can result in creating multiple files within the node_modules directory as the packages are extracted and installed.\n\nAnother point is that all events are generated by the same process, git.exe. This could be because Git bash or another Git tool is being used to execute npm commands, which would then trigger these file creation events.\n\nI also consider the possibility of malicious activity. However, there's no indication here of unusual access times, unknown user accounts, or deviations from baseline behavior. The files created are standard for a Node.js module setup, and the process involved is legitimate.\n\nGiven that all activities fit within expected behaviors during software development and package installations, especially in a Node.js environment, these events don't raise any red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access or suspicious file operations.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor file creation events, particularly under node_modules which can sometimes be targets for malicious activity, this batch doesn't exhibit signs that would necessitate further investigation beyond routine checks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a Node.js module directory, likely related to package installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a batch of JSONL events where each event shows that git.exe is creating files in specific paths under node_modules\/tcomb\/lib. The filenames are things like isNumber.js, isString.js, and others with .d.ts extensions.\n\nHmm, first off, git.exe creating files sounds normal because when you clone a repository or pull updates, Git might create new files as part of the process. These file paths seem to be in a node_modules directory, which is typical for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects. The tcomb library is something I've heard of before—it's a TypeScript library for validation, so it makes sense that these files are being created during development.\n\nBut wait, could this indicate something malicious? If someone was trying to inject or modify files, they might do so in a way that creates new files or modifies existing ones. However, in this case, all the events just show file creation without any indication of content changes or unusual activity. They're all standard files related to tcomb.\n\nI should also consider if creating multiple files in quick succession is suspicious. But given that these are part of a node_modules folder, it's likely during a build or install process, which would create several files at once. There's no evidence here of anything out of place like file deletions, access outside the expected directories, or attempts to execute code.\n\nSo putting it all together: git.exe creating multiple files in a standard project directory doesn't raise any red flags for me. It seems entirely normal and related to software development activities. Therefore, I don't see any reason to classify this batch as interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is normal during development or repository setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
