{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events from a cybersecurity perspective. The first thing that stands out is the repeated use of PowerShell.exe across multiple entries. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be a vector for malicious activities because it has such high privileges and scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking at the process details, there's a command line argument that includes several commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. These commands are typically used to gather information about users and groups on a system. The fact that this script is being run multiple times with slight variations makes me suspicious—this could be part of reconnaissance activity before an attack.\n\nI notice that there's also a file creation and deletion event for a PowerShell script in the Temporary folder. Creating and then deleting a script file quickly can be a way to avoid detection, especially if it's used for malicious purposes. This could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code or drop files temporarily without leaving a long trace.\n\nThe events involving registry value sets are another red flag. Malware often modifies the Windows Registry to maintain persistence between sessions. By setting registry values, attackers can ensure their scripts run on startup or at regular intervals, which is a common tactic in more advanced attacks.\n\nAdditionally, multiple ImageLoad events for various .dll files within PowerShell suggest that the script might be loading additional components or modules. This isn't inherently malicious, but combined with other behaviors like file creation and registry modification, it raises concerns about potential payload delivery or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe repetition of these actions across multiple entries indicates a possible automated process or a script running several commands in succession. This could be part of an attack chain where the initial compromise is followed by privilege escalation, information gathering, and establishing persistence.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the use of PowerShell with elevated privileges, command-line arguments that gather system info, temporary file operations, registry modifications, and repeated execution—it's highly indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, this batch of events is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that gather system information, modify the registry, and create\/delete temporary files, which are indicators of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. First, I notice a lot of PowerShell activity. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it can execute commands and scripts, making it a red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are repeated calls using powershell.exe with various commands like 'net user', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and directory listings. These seem like they're gathering system information, which is often part of reconnaissance activities before an attack.\n\nThe events also show multiple instances where net.exe and net1.exe are used to query user accounts and groups. This could be an attempt to gather user credentials or permissions, which is a common step in lateral movement within a network.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in the user's Downloads folder (elemento_logico.txt) and changes to PowerShell profile data. Creating files can indicate data exfiltration or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are several registry writes by both powershell.exe and conhost.exe. Registry modifications often suggest attempts to maintain persistent access, as attackers might add keys to run malicious scripts at startup.\n\nAdditionally, there's a series of events labeled under \"Security Group Management\" without corresponding process information. This could be an attempt to manipulate group policies or permissions without leaving a clear trace.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell command execution, system reconnaissance, file creation, and registry modifications suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of similar commands and tools further raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell command executions with potentially malicious intent, including user enumeration, group manipulation, and file creation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let's see... The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event involves RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because many Windows processes interact with the registry.\n2. Next is powershell.exe setting a registry value. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this could be something to look into, but on its own, it's not necessarily suspicious unless combined with other actions.\n3. Another powershell.exe event shows process access. Again, common in scripts, but worth noting if there are multiple such events.\n4. Winlogbeat.exe created a file. That makes sense since it's an agent for collecting logs, so no issue here.\n5. Notepad.exe also set a registry value. While not typical, notepad can sometimes be used to write files or interact with the system, but I don't see anything immediately concerning here.\n6. Powershell.exe accessing process again—so multiple events from powershell might indicate script execution, which could be normal admin activity or something malicious.\n7. Calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Calculator is usually benign, and urlmon is a standard Windows DLL for handling URLs, so this seems okay.\n8. Svchost.exe setting registry values twice._svchost.exe is commonly used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, without more context, these events alone aren't suspicious.\n9. Calculator.exe loaded the same urlmon.dll as before—nothing unusual here.\n10. Powershell.exe accessed process again—so multiple instances of powershell interacting with system components could hint at scripting or command execution.\n11. Whoami.exe was executed. This is a standard tool to check user information, often used by scripts or admins, so nothing suspicious here.\n12. Another powershell.exe event accessing the process.\n\nNow, looking at the batch as a whole: there are multiple powershell.exe instances with ProcessAccess tasks and some setting registry values. Additionally, RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe are involved in registry operations, which could be part of legitimate activities but might also indicate something more if these processes are behaving abnormally together.\n\nThe fact that several different processes (powershell, calc, notepad) are interacting with the registry and other system components might raise a flag. While each individual event isn't necessarily malicious, the combination could suggest unauthorized access or lateral movement. For example, using powershell to execute commands and modify the registry is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nI'm also noting that there's no file operation except for winlogbeat creating a config file, which is expected. The other events are all process creations and system calls, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nSo, considering all these points together, I think this batch is interesting because it shows multiple process interactions that don't immediately seem to have a legitimate purpose when viewed collectively. The repeated use of powershell and modifications to the registry might indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry, along with other system interactions, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
