{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm new to this, so I might miss some things, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one and see what's happening. The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nStarting with the first event: Process name is RuntimeBroker.exe, task is Registry value set. Not sure if that's normal or not. Maybe some legitimate Windows process accessing registry?\n\nNext, notepad.exe also has a Registry value set task. Notepad isn't usually doing that, but I'm not certain. Could it be malicious? Or maybe part of some configuration.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe with Process accessed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and attacks. So this could be suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nCalc.exe accessing urlmon.dll. Wait, calc.exe is a calculator app; why is it loading a DLL from System32? That might not be normal. Maybe some malicious code injected?\n\nSvchost.exe doing Registry value sets multiple times. Svchost is a legitimate process that runs services, but sometimes malware can replace or create new svchost instances. Multiple registry writes could indicate something bad.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. That seems normal if it's updating config files or logs. Not sure if that's an issue.\n\nWhoami.exe running with no command line. It's a tool to display user information, but if executed without arguments, maybe just checking the current user. Probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother powershell.exe Process accessed. Again, this is tricky since it's a common tool.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe writing to registry. This process is part of Windows shell; it's legitimate, so probably nothing wrong here.\n\nCalculator.exe again writing to registry and loading urlmon.dll. Similar to calc.exe earlier—this might be concerning if these are legitimate processes but doing unexpected things.\n\nCmd.exe with a command line that says \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". Oh, wait, Wmic is a tool for managing services. Deleting notepad.exe process sounds malicious. Maybe trying to terminate something or hide its activity.\n\nWMIC.exe running a similar delete command and loading urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. AMSI is Anti-Malware Scan Interface; maybe the process is trying to bypass it? Or it's legitimate system management.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several red flags:\n\n1. Multiple instances of Registry value sets by various processes, especially svchost.exe which is often used by malware.\n2. Powershell and cmd with commands that could be hiding or deleting processes (like deleting notepad.exe).\n3. Calculator and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which might indicate DLL injection or malicious activity since they're usually simple apps.\n4. WMIC being used to delete processes; this is a common tactic in malware for persistence or to remove evidence.\n\nThese activities could be indicators of an attack. Registry modifications are often part of persistence mechanisms, and deleting processes might be an attempt to cover tracks. The use of legitimate tools like powershell and wmic in unusual ways raises suspicion.\n\nI'm not 100% certain because some events could be benign, but the combination seems concerning enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications by svchost.exe and powershell.exe, deletion of processes via cmd.exe and WMIC.exe, and unexpected DLL loads by calc.exe and Calculator.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not. The user has given me a set of JSONL entries, each with process info, Windows logs, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, schtasks.exe, etc. Each entry under \"winlog\" seems to describe different tasks, such as Image loaded, Registry value set, Process Create, or Process accessed.\n\nLooking at the first event: WMIC.exe loading a DLL file from a Microsoft Windows Defender path. That's interesting because WMIC is often used for remote command execution and can be a vector for attacks. The fact that it's loading a specific DLL might indicate some kind of activity, but I need to see if there are other suspicious events around this.\n\nNext, several entries show processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, etc., performing Registry operations—setting values in the Registry. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities, like persistence mechanisms for malware. The fact that multiple processes are doing this could be a red flag, but I need to check if these are common actions or unusual.\n\nI see powershell.exe being accessed and modified registry entries multiple times. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for script execution, so repeated access might indicate suspicious activity. Also, the command lines in some cmd.exe processes catch my eye: one copies an exe file, another deletes a scheduled task using schtasks. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but could be part of an attack chain.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where whoami.exe is run with its command line, which usually retrieves system information. While this can be innocent, it's often used in recon to gather user info, so repeated uses might suggest probing.\n\nThe use of schtasks.exe to delete a task (schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f) stands out too. Scheduling tasks and deleting them could be part of persistence or cleanup routines by malware.\n\nPutting it all together: there are several red flags—use of WMIC with a DLL, multiple registry writes by various processes, powershell access, command line operations that modify system files, deletion of scheduled tasks, and repeated use of whoami. These activities, especially in combination, could indicate malicious behavior. While each event on its own might not be alarming, the pattern suggests possible compromise or attack.\n\nI should also consider if these actions are part of normal user activity. For example, a user running cmd to delete a task might do that intentionally, but the frequency and combination with other suspicious activities lower the confidence in it being benign.\n\nTherefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the cumulative evidence points to potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple suspicious activities such as WMIC.exe loading a DLL, repeated registry modifications by various processes including PowerShell and cmd.exe, deletion of scheduled tasks, and use of whoami.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where different processes like schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, and chrome.exe are involved. The tasks mentioned include things like Image loaded, Registry object added\/deleted, Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create.\n\nI notice that many of these events involve registry activity or process creations. For example, cmd.exe is being used with command lines that look like they're executing commands, maybe even running scripts. Powershell.exe appears multiple times, which can be a red flag because it's often used for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks:\n- schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll might be normal for scheduling tasks.\n- svchost.exe is a common process but can sometimes be associated with malware.\n- cmd.exe and conhost.exe are shell processes, but repeated use could indicate something's off.\n- The multiple instances of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess or RegistryEvent tasks are concerning. Malware often uses these to modify system configurations or access other processes.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process which is typically used to get user information. If this is running without clear justification, it might be part of an attack vector to gather system details.\n\nConsidering the combination, the high number of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities with registry modifications stands out. These behaviors can be indicators of malicious scripts trying to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. The use of multiple processes could be an attempt to cover tracks or distribute the workload across different tools, which is common in more sophisticated attacks.\n\nWhile some events might be benign (like normal system processes), the overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with suspicious activities, such as registry modifications and process access, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events to determine if they're worth investigating. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated use might be a red flag. Looking deeper, there are instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and even creating files in temporary directories. The creation and subsequent deletion of a script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1) stands out. This could indicate that an attacker is testing execution policies or attempting to run malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are several events where powershell.exe interacts with the registry (Registry value set). Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it runs on system startup or remains undetected.\n\nAnother point is the use of command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\". This format is often seen in attempts to obfuscate commands, possibly to avoid detection by security tools. The repeated occurrence of such commands across multiple events suggests a concerted effort to execute code discreetly.\n\nFurthermore, there are file load events for mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components. While these are legitimate files, their loading from specific paths might indicate that powershell is invoking .NET-based attacks or reflective DLL injection techniques, which are common in malware.\n\nThe presence of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the logs could be related to how the powershell environment is being set up or torn down, potentially indicating a session setup for malicious activities.\n\nLastly, an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file might not be directly suspicious on its own, but combined with the other powershell activities, it adds context that system monitoring tools are in use. However, without more info, it's hard to say if this is part of normal operations or something else.\n\nPutting all these together—the repeated powershell executions, registry modifications, temporary script creation\/deletion, command line obfuscation, and .NET file loading—points towards potential malicious activity. The combination suggests someone is trying to execute code stealthily on the system, possibly for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directory, and command line obfuscation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers for malicious activities like command execution and lateral movement. So, multiple powershell.exe entries might warrant closer examination.\n\nLooking at the specific actions:\n- There are several events where powershell.exe is loading images (ImageLoad), which could indicate it's executing code or scripts.\n- File operations include creating files in user directories like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Creating new files, especially in non-standard locations, might be a red flag if the file content isn't known.\n- Registry modifications are present (Registry value set), which is concerning because attackers often use registry changes to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n- Process creation and access events show that powershell.exe is spawning other processes, potentially indicating command execution. The command lines in some events seem obfuscated with if statements checking for batch files' existence. This could be a technique to bypass certain security measures or execute code conditionally.\n\nThe repeated pattern of creating processes, accessing registry keys, and loading images suggests a possible script being executed, which might be malicious in nature. Additionally, the varied file paths mentioned (like modulo_geral, pacote_temporario) don't seem standard and could be part of a custom payload's structure.\n\nGiven that there are multiple events tied to powershell.exe with various suspicious activities, it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation. The confidence level is high because the combination of process creation, registry changes, file operations, and obfuscated command lines points towards potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious activities including file creation, registry modifications, and image loads suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user has provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of these events are related to PowerShell.exe activities. There are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading images, creating files, and interacting with the registry. For example, there's a file creation event for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 in the Temp directory. That looks suspicious because scripts dropped into temp folders can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nThen, I see that this script is created and then deleted right after. The back-and-forth between creating and deleting a file might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or test if certain policies are enforced, like script execution policies in PowerShell. This kind of behavior isn't typical for legitimate scripts; attackers often use such techniques to bypass security measures.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of registry activity from chrome.exe. Seven entries of Registry value set from chrome seems excessive and unusual because Chrome doesn't typically interact with the registry that much during normal operation. This could be an indication of tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up, which are common in malware.\n\nAlso, the command lines for powershell.exe look odd. They're using if statements to check for the existence of certain batch files and then exiting based on that. This seems like a way to test whether those files exist before executing malicious code. Such conditional checks can be part of reconnaissance or an attempt to avoid detection by only running when specific conditions are met.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is loading various .dlls, which might be normal for its operation, but combined with the other behaviors, it raises suspicion. Malware often uses legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute malicious commands because they're more likely to bypass security filters.\n\nConsidering all these events together: file creation and deletion of a script in Temp, registry modifications from an unexpected source (chrome.exe), and conditional checks using PowerShell—all point towards potential malicious activities. The sequence of actions seems coordinated rather than random, which is a red flag for an attack.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about each individual event's severity, but the combination does suggest something worth investigating. So, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including file creation and deletion of a script in Temp directory, registry modifications from chrome.exe, and conditional checks in command lines suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL events here, each representing some system activity. The user wants me to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe processes. That's already a red flag because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. Malware often uses it to hide its tracks or execute commands.\n\nThe first event shows that a new item is being created in a file path: \"C:\\estrutura_auxiliar\\modulo_secundario..pacote_base\\Componente_temporario_script.bat\". The command is using New-Item with -Force and redirecting output to Out-Null. Creating files, especially batch scripts, could be part of setting up persistence or dropping malicious scripts.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These look normal for PowerShell as it's .NET-based, but sometimes attackers load malicious libraries or use these legitimate ones for obfuscation.\n\nThere are also several events with the task 'Provider Lifecycle' and command lines that create new batch files in different directories. Each time, they're creating a new script bat file and setting its content to \"dir\". That's interesting because writing scripts to disk can be part of persistence mechanisms or dropping backdoors. The fact that multiple such files are being created across various paths suggests a pattern.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to navigate up directories using \"..\" which might indicate attempts to write to different parts of the filesystem, possibly trying to avoid detection by spreading out writes or targeting less commonly checked locations.\n\nThe command lines in each event vary slightly but follow a similar structure. They create a new batch script and set its content to \"dir\", which is a simple directory listing command. While that might seem benign, it's unusual for scripts to be created without any subsequent execution, especially when multiple such files are being generated across different directories.\n\nThe combination of creating multiple batch files with the same content and using powershell.exe could indicate script-kiddie activity or part of a larger campaign. Alternatively, it might be automated testing, but given the volume and varied paths, it's more likely malicious in nature.\n\nI'm also noticing that these events are spread across different directories, which isn't typical for legitimate script creation. It might be an attempt to create multiple points of persistence or to distribute malicious code across the system.\n\nSo putting it all together: repeated powershell.exe processes creating batch files with similar commands across various directories. This pattern is suspicious because it's not a common user activity and could be indicative of malicious scripting, possibly part of a script dropper or a way to create persistence points for later execution.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating batch files in various directories with similar command structures, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The user wants a single classification based on the entire batch. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so any PowerShell activity could be red flags. \n\nLooking at the first event, it's a process start with a command line that creates new items and sets content in batch files. Creating new files can be part of setting up persistence or dropping malicious scripts. The fact that these are .bat files might indicate scripting activity.\n\nThe second event shows a file creation of a PowerShell script in the Temp folder. Then, immediately after, it's deleted. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up traces. However, sometimes legitimate scripts also do this, but combined with other actions, it raises suspicion.\n\nThere are several Pipe Created events and Image Load events from powershell.exe, which might be normal for script execution, but they occur frequently here. The Registry value sets in multiple processes could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or create persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother event shows a check if a specific .bat file exists; if not, it exits. This might be part of ensuring the malicious script isn't already present before deploying it again, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid re-infection checks.\n\nThe multiple Image Load events loading various DLLs seem normal, but in combination with other activities, they add to the suspicion. The overall pattern—creating files, checking their existence, deleting temporary scripts—resembles behavior used by malicious actors to maintain persistence and execute commands without being easily detected.\n\nI'm considering if these actions could be legitimate. For example, a system might create temporary scripts during updates or backups. However, the repeated creation of batch files with specific names and the registry modifications are more concerning. The fact that multiple processes (powershell.exe and conhost.exe) are modifying the registry adds to the potential risk.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while some actions are suspicious, there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution. However, the combination of file creation, deletion, registry changes, and script checks leans towards potentially malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files in unusual paths, combined with registry modifications and file deletions, suggest potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm seeing multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of certain .bat files and exit based on their presence or absence. The paths in these commands are using variables like \"modulo_secundario\", \"registro_logico\", and others, which seem to be related to some kind of logical structure or module.\n\nThe fact that each PowerShell command is checking a different path pattern could indicate either legitimate script execution or something more nefarious, like a malicious payload trying different ways to verify its components. The repeated use of Test-Path suggests they're probing the file system for specific files, which might be part of an installation routine or a check before executing further commands.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where PowerShell creates and then deletes temporary files in the user's AppData directory. This behavior is often seen in malicious scripts to avoid detection by deleting traces of their activity quickly. The creation of \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\" and its subsequent deletion within a short time frame raises suspicion because it mimics how attackers might test execution without leaving long-term evidence.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's also an instance where \"winlogbeat.exe\" creates a configuration file in the Downloads folder. While this could be normal for some tools or scripts, combined with the PowerShell activities, it adds to the context that something is being set up or configured on the system.\n\nThe registry write and process access tasks might indicate that the script is attempting to establish persistence or modify system settings, which are common tactics in malware to ensure continued execution after a restart. The repeated use of \"powershell.exe\" across different events also stands out because attackers often abuse legitimate tools for their activities.\n\nOverall, while some of these actions could be part of normal administrative tasks, the combination of checking multiple file paths with variable names, temporary file creation and deletion, and registry modifications points towards potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm looking at the JSONL data provided.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it has a lot of capabilities for both good and bad purposes. The command lines in these logs look like they're checking if certain files exist using Test-Path. Each one checks a different path with names that seem to be in Portuguese, like \"entrada_base.exe\" or \"registro_ativo.exe\". That's unusual because most system processes wouldn't need to check so many varied paths, especially with such specific filenames.\n\nAlso, there are events where whoami.exe was executed. That tool is typically used to find out the current user's information. While not inherently malicious, it could be part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack, which would make it suspicious when combined with the other PowerShell activity.\n\nLooking at the tasks reported in the winlog field: there are Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Load events. The RegistryEvent for setting a registry value is notable because attackers often modify system configurations to maintain persistence or change system behavior.\n\nMoreover, several of these logs have 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. I'm not entirely sure what that entails, but it might relate to how the system handles certain processes or modules. It could indicate that PowerShell is loading various components, which in a normal scenario would be expected during operation, but combined with other indicators, it's something to watch.\n\nThe multiple checks for file existence could be part of a script trying to ensure certain files are present before proceeding, possibly to execute malicious code if those files aren't found. Alternatively, it might be testing the presence of files to bypass detection mechanisms or gather information about the system.\n\nI'm also noticing that some command lines have escaped quotes and backslashes, which is typical in PowerShell when invoking commands from scripts. This makes me think that these could be part of a script execution chain, possibly downloading additional components or attempting to execute code once certain conditions are met.\n\nThe repeated use of 'powershell.exe' across multiple events without any clear benign purpose raises my concern. While legitimate scripts do use PowerShell, the combination here seems more indicative of malicious activity. The varied file paths being checked don't seem to correspond to standard system files or known good locations, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nAdditionally, the process creation and access events for 'powershell.exe' might suggest that it's being spawned multiple times, possibly from different sources or in an attempt to evade detection by spreading out the activity across numerous log entries. This kind of behavior is often seen in attacks where the adversary wants to remain under the radar.\n\nThe involvement of mscoree.dll and other .NET framework components in Image Load events might be part of obfuscating the attack, using legitimate libraries to execute malicious code. While this isn't conclusive on its own, it's another piece of the puzzle that makes me think there's something more going on here.\n\nOverall, considering all these factors together—the repeated PowerShell activity with file checks, process creations, registry modifications—it seems like a coordinated effort that could be malicious. There might not be enough evidence for a definitive conclusion yet, but the combination of events is certainly red flagging as potentially suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with file existence checks and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The user wants me to analyze all these JSONL entries together and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see that almost every event involves powershell.exe. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. But wait, some of the events are about files being created, deleted, and registry changes. For example, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1 created and then deleted. That looks suspicious—maybe it's a script trying to bypass policies?\n\nAlso, looking at the command lines for powershell.exe, they have these long paths with spaces. That could be an attempt to hide malicious activities or execute commands in a way that's harder to trace. The fact that there are multiple attempts to access different files and registry keys might indicate a broader exploration of the system.\n\nThere's also whoami.exe being executed a couple of times, which is often used to check user permissions or gather information about the current user. That could be part of an attacker's footprinting phase. Plus, cmd.exe is running some IF EXIST checks, which might be testing for certain files that would indicate whether they can proceed with their attack.\n\nI also notice that some events are about processes accessing other processes and registry changes. This could be indicative of privilege escalation or setting up persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell executions with potentially malicious scripts, file deletions to cover tracks, command-line obfuscation, system exploration tools like whoami.exe and cmd.exe—this batch seems to show signs of potential malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the combination of these events isn't typical for normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and process access. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior such as script execution or system exploration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. They're all from the same process, powershell.exe, which is a common tool used by both admins and attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities.\n\nI see multiple instances where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check if certain files exist in specific paths. For example, one event checks if \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\estrutura_comum\\src\\estrutura_temporario.cs\" exists. If it does, the script exits with 0; otherwise, it exits with 1.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple such events, each checking different file paths across various directories (like C:\\modulo_secundario, C:\\registro_principal, etc.), suggests a pattern of trying to verify the presence of specific files. This behavior could be part of legitimate operations, like ensuring required scripts or components exist before proceeding with other tasks.\n\nHowever, the concern arises when multiple checks are made in different locations across the filesystem. In cybersecurity, repeated attempts to access or check for the existence of files can be indicative of malicious activity. Attackers might use such checks to ensure their tools or payloads are present without being detected, or they might be probing for certain configurations that could be exploited.\n\nAdditionally, the process creates PowerShell instances multiple times, and each time it's executed with a specific command line. This repeated execution could be part of an automated script trying different things in quick succession, which is another red flag. Powershell scripts are often used in attacks because they can execute code, download files, or interact with system resources.\n\nAnother point to consider is the file paths being checked. The paths seem structured but vary in their naming and locations across different directories. This might indicate that the script is attempting to access a variety of potential targets, possibly trying to find something it expects to be there. If these checks are failing (i.e., exiting with 1), it could mean that those files aren't present, which might not necessarily be suspicious on its own but could be part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nMoreover, the events include registry access and image loading, which are common in script executions as PowerShell loads various libraries. While these activities are typical for any PowerShell usage, the combination with multiple file checks raises the suspicion that this might be part of an attack chain.\n\nI also note that some events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" task type instead of more typical process creation or access tasks. This could mean that the script is interacting with system providers in a way that's not standard, possibly attempting to hide its tracks or interact with system services surreptitiously.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be highly suspicious, the pattern of repeated PowerShell executions checking various file paths across different directories over multiple events does raise concerns. This could indicate an attacker probing the system for specific files or attempting to execute malicious scripts conditionally based on file presence. The combination of these factors makes this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines checking various file paths, possibly indicating malicious activity or unauthorized system probing.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate JSON object. The main processes involved are 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see that powershell.exe is loading images like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These sound like they could be related to antivirus or system security components. However, when I check the paths, they're located under \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender...\", which does make sense for legitimate Windows Defender files.\n\nNext, there are file creation events by powershell.exe in temporary directories. For example, \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1\" is created and then deleted shortly after. This pattern looks like it could be part of script validation or testing. It's possible that PowerShell is checking if certain scripts exist before proceeding.\n\nI also notice several events where powershell.exe accesses other processes, which might be normal if it's querying process information. Additionally, there are multiple command lines calling powershell.exe with specific paths to check for the existence of files like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". This repetition makes me think it's part of a script checking multiple locations, perhaps during a configuration or setup phase.\n\nThe whoami.exe event is straightforward—it's a common utility to get user information and isn't inherently suspicious on its own. \n\nOverall, while some actions could be red flags if seen in isolation (like file creation\/deletion in temp directories), the combination here doesn't show any signs of malicious activity. The repeated checks for specific scripts might be part of a legitimate process or script execution flow. There's no evidence of unusual file operations beyond what's typical for PowerShell, and all the files referenced seem to belong to known Microsoft products or standard temporary data.\n\nSo, considering the entire batch together, it doesn't appear to indicate malicious behavior but rather normal system activities involving PowerShell scripting checks and antivirus-related processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate PowerShell activity including script validation and temporary file creation\/deletion, which are typical for Windows Defender operations. No signs of malicious behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell executing a command that checks for the presence of \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" in different paths. That script name sounds suspicious because it implies keylogging, which is malicious. The fact that it's checking multiple locations might indicate an attempt to ensure the script exists or perhaps it's trying to drop it somewhere.\n\nThe second event shows a registry value being set by PowerShell. This could be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing the script to run at startup, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nLooking through the other events, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing files and loading images. The image loads include .NET framework components, which is normal, but combined with the file creation and deletion events, it's worth noting. Specifically, a temporary PowerShell script is created and then immediately deleted. This behavior can be indicative of script injection or testing permissions before executing malicious code.\n\nThere are several \"Image loaded\" events for different DLLs. While these might seem benign, the combination with other activities could suggest that the script is loading various components to ensure it runs correctly or to avoid detection.\n\nThe last event shows a file being created by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely unrelated to malicious activity since it's part of log management software.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated checks for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\", the registry modification, and the temporary script creation\/deletion are red flags. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior such as keylogging or persistence mechanisms. The confidence level is high because these actions collectively indicate a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events checking for and potentially attempting to execute a suspicious script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), including file creation\/deletion of temporary files, registry modifications, and image loading activities indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe doing various things like file creation, registry changes, and process access. Powershell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be a red flag because it's commonly abused in attacks. The fact that it's accessing different files and registry values could indicate malicious activity, especially if these actions aren't part of normal user behavior.\n\nThen I see whoami.exe being executed twice. Whoami is usually harmless as it just displays user information, but it can sometimes be used to gather system info which might be a precursor to more malicious acts. It's something to keep an eye on, but by itself, not too concerning unless there are other signs.\n\nNotepad.exe writing to the registry and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll caught my attention. Notepad shouldn't typically interact with the registry much, so that could be suspicious. As for Calculator loading a DLL, it's unusual because such system files being loaded might indicate tampering or malware activities trying to hide themselves.\n\nThere are also entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is related to log management, but if this process is behaving abnormally, like creating unexpected files, it could be part of an attack on logging systems as attackers try to delete logs to cover their tracks.\n\nThen there's a lot of network activity from Chrome and svchost.exe. Svchost is a system process that can host various services, so seeing multiple NetworkConnect events might not be unusual, but combined with other activities, it could be part of data exfiltration or communication with command-and-control servers.\n\nLooking at the overall batch, there's a pattern of processes accessing files and registry entries (powershell.exe), network connections from svchost.exe and chrome.exe, and some unexpected actions like notepad interacting with the registry. These activities together might indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or system information gathering.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the combination of powershell's file and registry access, non-standard process interactions, and multiple network connections that don't seem to fit a normal user's activity. The confidence is around 0.8 because while there are several red flags, some could be legitimate, but the pattern suggests possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as powershell.exe accessing files and registry values, whoami.exe executions, unusual file operations by notepad.exe and calculator.exe, and network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. The first thing that catches my eye is the repeated use of powershell.exe with command lines that seem suspicious. They're using commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem in a way that could be enumerating directories recursively. That's a common tactic for reconnaissance or to gather information about the system.\n\nThen, I notice that there are multiple events where files are created and then deleted shortly after. The file paths look temporary, which might indicate an attempt to execute code without leaving long-term traces. Also, the repeated registry value sets could be modifying system configurations, possibly to maintain persistence or alter security settings.\n\nThe DNS query event from chrome.exe isn't too alarming on its own, but combined with the other activities, it adds up. The fact that whoami.exe was executed might suggest an attempt to gather user information, which is often a precursor to more malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these pieces together—multiple powershell executions with potentially harmful commands, file creation and deletion, registry modifications—it seems like there's a pattern of behavior indicative of possible malicious intent. This combination could be part of a larger attack campaign aiming to establish persistence or move laterally within the network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activity, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and repeated process creations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe with a command line that includes several PowerShell commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem'. This looks suspicious because PowerShell is often used in scripting, especially for malicious purposes. Repeated use of 'get-childitem' might be part of a script trying to gather information across directories.\n\nThe second event is another powershell.exe process with the same command line as the first one but under a different task category. It's still concerning because it indicates repeated activity from the same or similar processes, which could be part of an automated script running multiple times.\n\nLooking at the third event, again, it's powershell.exe, and this time, there's a file path mentioned for MpClient.dll. That seems odd because that's a legitimate Windows Defender file. Maybe the script is trying to load a malicious module or something from there? Or perhaps it's just loading system files, but I need to keep an eye on where else powershell.exe is accessing.\n\nThe fourth event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log management and may be part of ELK stack tools. However, seeing it creating a new config file could be normal during setup or updates, but without more context, I'm not sure if this is suspicious.\n\nThe fifth event again shows powershell.exe with the same command line as before. This repetition makes me think that maybe there's a script running multiple times, possibly trying to avoid detection or carry out multiple tasks across different directories.\n\nMoving on to the sixth event, it's another powershell.exe process creating a file in the user's local AppData folder under a Microsoft Windows PowerShell directory. The filename mentions 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', which sounds like it might be part of profile initialization but could also be a way for scripts to store configurations or malicious code.\n\nThe seventh and eighth events show powershell.exe and conhost.exe both setting registry values. Modifying the registry can be a red flag because attackers often use this method to persistence or change system settings to allow future access. Conhost.exe is usually associated with command prompt but sometimes used by scripts for elevation, which adds another layer of suspicion.\n\nThe ninth event has powershell.exe creating a file named 'estrutura_secundario.txt' in the Downloads directory. The filename doesn't immediately raise red flags, but combined with previous events, it suggests that powershell.exe is generating multiple files across different locations, which might be part of data exfiltration or setting up persistence points.\n\nThe tenth and eleventh events repeat the winlogbeat file creation and another powershell.exe process accessing something. Repetition can indicate automated behavior, possibly a script looping through directories or running multiple times to execute commands.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice several patterns: repeated powershell.exe processes with similar command lines, multiple files being created by these processes in various directories (Downloads, AppData), registry modifications, and the use of legitimate tools like winlogbeat. While some of these actions could be part of normal system administration or script execution, the combination—especially the repeated and varied file accesses and registry changes—is concerning.\n\nThe command-line arguments in powershell.exe are particularly worrying because they involve directory traversal with 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem', which might indicate data gathering across multiple directories. Additionally, the creation of files in user-specific locations could be a tactic to avoid detection or for persistence.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events might seem benign on their own, the overall pattern suggests potential malicious activity. The combination of repeated powershell.exe usage with directory traversal commands and file creations across different paths adds up to something that's definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with similar command-line arguments, including directory traversal commands, along with file creation and registry modification events. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
