{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where PowerShell.exe is accessed and there are registry changes. Specifically, there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe processes that adds an entry to the Run key with a path pointing to \"C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe\". That seems suspicious because adding entries to the Run key can allow persistence for malicious software.\n\nThen, I notice another event where reg.exe is used to add another registry value pointing to \"C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe\". This reinforces the idea that there might be an attempt to install something persistently on the system.\n\nThere are also events where files are created. One of them is by conhost.exe, which I know can sometimes be used as a command-line host for scripts or malicious activities. The file path \"modulo_padrao.txt\" doesn't immediately ring any bells, but combined with the other activity, it's worth noting.\n\nThe fact that both cmd.exe and reg.exe are being used to modify the registry suggests possible attempts to create persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the use of multiple tools like PowerShell and cmd could be an indicator of a script or toolset commonly used in attacks.\n\nI also notice that winlogbeat.exe is creating files related to its configuration. That's probably benign unless it's part of some malicious activity, but on its own, it doesn't stand out as suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of registry modifications and file creation by different processes raises flags for potential malicious behavior. The multiple attempts to modify system settings could indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or deploy malware.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creations, and the use of command-line tools like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.
