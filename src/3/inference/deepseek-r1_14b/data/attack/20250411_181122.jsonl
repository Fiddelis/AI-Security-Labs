That seems normal for a user checking their permissions, so probably nothing malicious there.\n\nNext up are several powershell.exe entries. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can do both good and bad things. Looking closer at the command line, I see they're using findstr to search for 'pass' in various file extensions like .xml, .doc, etc., which could be looking for sensitive information. That’s a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading different DLLs. While this is standard for script execution, the combination with the suspicious command line makes me think it's part of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event where a temp PowerShell script was created and then immediately deleted. That’s a classic technique to avoid detection by leaving no footprint on disk. Definitely suspicious.\n\nMultiple Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe suggest that the process is being monitored or possibly terminated, which could be an indicator of something trying to hide its activity.\n\nNotepad.exe accessing the registry isn't unusual, but in this context with all the other events, it might not add much unless it's part of a larger attack chain.\n\nFinally, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seems normal as part of its functionality, so no issue there.\n\nPutting it all together: repeated powershell usage with commands to search for passwords, creation and deletion of temp scripts, multiple process accesses and registry changes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe loading a DLL file. That's suspicious because PowerShell is often used in attacks. Then there's another event with a command line that uses findstr looking for passwords, which sounds like it could be data exfiltration or credential harvesting.\n\nNext, svchost.exe writing to the registry. SvcHost is a common process but unusual activity might indicate something. There are multiple such events, so maybe it's part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nCalculator.exe loading another DLL – not sure if that's normal. It's a benign app, but sometimes malware can hide under its name.\n\nFindstr.exe being called with specific arguments to search for 'pass' in various files. That's another data-mining attempt, possibly looking for sensitive info.\n\nThere are several registry writes by different processes like OfficeClickToRun and Calculator. Registry changes can be part of persistence or configuration for malicious activities.\n\nI notice a lot of activity from chrome.exe, including multiple registry writes and DNS queries. While Chrome is legitimate, the sheer number of events might indicate something's off, like extension abuse or tracking.\n\nA file creation event by winlogbeat – that seems okay if it's part of log management, but I'm not certain without more context.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple signs of suspicious behavior, especially the PowerShell and findstr activities looking for passwords.

But the combination raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as PowerShell command-line operations searching for sensitive terms and registry modifications that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user has provided several JSONL entries, each with process information, windows log tasks, and file paths.\n\nFirst, I'll start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with tasks like Image loaded, Registry value set, and Network connections detected. These seem normal since Chrome is a common browser that loads images and interacts with registries and network resources regularly. However, I should keep an eye out for any unusual activities related to these.\n\nNext, I notice some powershell.exe events where files are being created or accessed. Powershell can be used both benignly and maliciously, so this could be a red flag. For instance, one event creates 'objeto_logico.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. Another event creates 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. I'm not sure what these files contain, but file creation by powershell might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThen there are several instances where processes like cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are used with command lines that involve deleting scheduled tasks. The commands look like they're trying to delete specific task names, such as \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". This could be part of legitimate system administration or it might be an attempt to remove malicious scripts that run on startup. I need to consider whether these tasks are authorized or if they were added without proper permissions.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running, which is usually used to check user information. If this is triggered by something unusual, it could indicate reconnaissance activity, but in this case, it's hard to tell from just one event.\n\nAnother point is the schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. This is normal for scheduled task operations, so probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe svchost.exe modifying registry entries isn't too concerning unless there are other signs pointing towards malicious activity. Svchost is a common system process that can be used by various services.\n\nConsidering all these points, the main areas of concern seem to be:\n\n1. Powershell activities: Creating files could be for legitimate reasons, but without knowing what's in those files, it's risky. Malware often uses powershell scripts to execute commands and create malicious files.\n2. Process deletions with cmd.exe and schtasks.exe: If these tasks were created by unauthorized users or as part of a malicious payload, their deletion could be an attempt to cover tracks or remove persistent malware components.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of events. There are multiple powershell executions and process creations\/deletions which might indicate automated activity, possibly from scripts running at intervals.\n\nAdditionally, some processes don't have command lines (marked as 'None'), which is unusual and might be an attempt to hide certain operations or could indicate issues with logging.\n\nTo summarize my initial thoughts: The batch shows a mix of normal activities and potentially suspicious actions involving powershell and scheduled tasks. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination points towards possible malicious behavior that would merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided system log events indicates potential security concerns that warrant closer examination. Here is a structured summary of the findings:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Powershell Activities**:\n   - **File Creation**: Powershell.exe created files named 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt'. These files could be legitimate or malicious, depending on their content and purpose.\n   - **Registry Operations**: Powershell was used to set registry values, which can be part of legitimate operations but may also indicate malware activity.\n\n2. **Scheduled Task Manipulation**:\n   - **Task Deletion**: cmd.exe and schtasks.exe were used to delete scheduled tasks with names like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". These deletions might be part of removing unauthorized or malicious scripts, but their origin is unclear.\n\n3. **Process Execution**:\n   - **whoami.exe**: This process was used to gather user information, which could indicate reconnaissance activity if executed inappropriately.\n   - **svchost.exe**: Modified registry entries, which can be normal unless associated with other suspicious activities.\n\n4. **Event Frequency and Context**:\n   - Multiple powershell executions and process deletions suggest possible automated or script-based operations, potentially malicious in nature.\n   - Some processes lack command-line information, which might indicate attempts to obscure activity or logging issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe log events exhibit a combination of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The presence of powershell file creation and registry modifications, coupled with the deletion of scheduled tasks, raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or malware. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of these activities and ensure system security."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving schtasks.exe deleting a task. That's interesting because schtasks is often used for scheduling tasks, but deletion might indicate someone trying to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, svchost.exe accessing the registry stands out. Svchost is a legitimate process, but unexpected registry activity could be malicious. Similarly, cmd.exe being used with command lines like deleting processes (notepad.exe) and users suggests possible system manipulation or cleanup efforts.\n\nPowerShell executions are frequent here. While PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities, it's also commonly used by admins. However, repeated accesses and registry modifications without clear reason might be red flags.\n\nThe use of wmic.exe to delete processes is another concern. WMIC can be a tool for remote command execution, which is often associated with attacks. The fact that it's being used here could indicate an attempt to manage or kill processes remotely.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there are multiple instances of process creation and deletion, registry modifications, and deletions of user accounts via net.exe and net1.exe. These activities collectively show a pattern of potentially malicious behavior, possibly related to privilege escalation, persistence removal, or system compromise.\n\nI'm noticing that several commands are using redirection (>) to suppress output, which is a common tactic to avoid detection. The deletion of specific users and tasks might be an attempt to cover tracks or remove access points.\n\nWhile some events individually could be benign, the combination raises suspicions. The repeated use of tools like schtasks, cmd, powershell, wmic, and net for such actions without clear justification is concerning. This batch shows a high level of activity that could indicate a breach or attack.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, this batch is definitely interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as process deletions, registry modifications, user account removals, and the use of tools like schtasks.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wmic.exe, and net.exe in a manner that suggests system compromise or attack.

I'm going to go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows cmd.exe being used, but it doesn't have a command line specified. Then there's conhost.exe doing something with the registry—setting a value. Next, powershell.exe accesses some process. After that, whoami.exe is run without any arguments. Powershell again accessing processes.\n\nI see several entries where the process name is None and tasks are User Account Management or Security Group Management. These could be normal user activities like logins or group updates. \n\nLooking further down, cmd.exe is used with a command line to delete a user account: \"net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\". Deleting users can be part of system administration, but without context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThen there are more instances of net.exe and net1.exe deleting other users. Using 'net user' commands is common for managing accounts, so again, could be legitimate or part of an attack.\n\nThere's a command that deletes the service \"win32times\" using sc delete. Deleting services can be part of malware trying to remove competition or disable monitoring tools. The process names cmd.exe and sc.exe are used here, which seem standard but in this context might be concerning.\n\nMultiple events show powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. Powershell is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities, so repeated access could indicate malicious activity.\n\nThe services.exe processes are modifying the registry multiple times—adding or deleting objects. Services typically interact with the registry, but unusual patterns here could signal issues.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a lot of process creation and registry modifications, especially using cmd.exe and powershell.exe to delete users and services. These activities alone aren't necessarily malicious, but their frequency and combination might raise red flags. The repeated deletions could be part of an attack trying to remove evidence or disrupt system operations.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because the pattern suggests potential unauthorized access or system tampering. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But given the number of suspicious activities, I think it warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and registry modifications involving potentially malicious commands like user deletions and service removals.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. Both are common tools for legitimate tasks but can also be used maliciously. The first event shows powershell.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, but in large volumes or with specific patterns, it might indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process deleting files in the temp directory. Del commands can be part of cleanup by malware to remove traces of their activity. This could be a red flag, especially if these files are associated with known malicious processes or if they're being deleted systematically.\n\nAnother event is powershell.exe accessing a process. Powershell often has legitimate uses, but process access without clear justification might be worth investigating.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe setting registry values again and deleting another file in the temp directory. This repetition of using both cmd and powershell for similar actions is making me think that these could be part of a script or batch process trying to hide itself or its activities.\n\nThen there are multiple events where conhost.exe sets registry values. Conhost is typically used by command-line tools, but again, if it's doing this in combination with other processes, it might indicate malicious activity.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe entries accessing processes and setting registry values. The repetition here is significant. I recall that attackers often use these tools to maintain persistence or for lateral movement within a network.\n\nI also see whoami.exe being executed. While whoami is a legitimate tool to check user permissions, its execution in the context of other suspicious activities might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather information about the system.\n\nLooking at the file operations, there's a powershell.exe creating and then deleting a specific .ps1 script in the temp directory. This seems like it could be part of a script test or as part of obfuscation techniques where scripts are created temporarily and then deleted to avoid detection.\n\nThe number of events involving both cmd.exe and powershell.exe is high, which might not be normal user activity. Typically, legitimate use wouldn't involve such a combination unless running automated scripts, but given the context of deleting temp files and accessing registry values, it's concerning.\n\nAlso, some of the powershell.exe entries show command lines with '& {}', which is an empty argument. This is often used in script injection attacks where malicious code is appended after an ampersand. This could be a sign of command-line injection or abuse.\n\nThe file paths being accessed by powershell.exe seem to include system directories like Windows\/System32 and Microsoft.NET, which are standard, but the volume might indicate something more. Additionally, the creation and deletion of a .ps1 script in the temp directory is suspicious because attackers often use such files for malicious scripts that they don't want to persist on disk.\n\nIn summary, while individual events could be legitimate, the combination—using both cmd.exe and powershell.exe for file deletions, registry modifications, process access, along with command-line anomalies—points towards potential malicious activity. The repetition and specific actions like deleting temp files are red flags that shouldn't be ignored.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events exhibits a concerning pattern indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Repetitive Use of Powershell.exe and cmd.exe**: The extensive use of these tools, which are commonly exploited by attackers, raises suspicion. Both are legitimate but can be misused for scripting or persistence.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications and File Deletions**: Multiple events show registry value modifications and file deletions in the temp directory. These actions could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or establish persistence.\n\n3. **Process Access and Command-Line Injection**: Powershell.exe accessing processes and cmd.exe with empty command-line arguments suggests potential script injection or malicious activity, such as command-line attacks.\n\n4. **Temporary Script Creation and Deletion**: The creation and subsequent deletion of a .ps1 script in the temp directory could indicate obfuscation techniques used by malware to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Use of whoami.exe**: While legitimate on its own, the execution in tandem with other suspicious activities may suggest privilege escalation or information gathering.\n\nGiven these factors, the events collectively present a significant red flag, suggesting possible malicious intent rather than normal user activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here, each with process, winlog, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice that powershell.exe appears a lot. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it can do so many things, both good and bad. So seeing it multiple times might be a red flag. But sometimes admins use it for legitimate tasks too. Let me check what it's doing each time.\n\nLooking at the events, some of them are about processes being created or accessed. For example, whoami.exe is called a few times. That's usually harmless—it just shows user info. But in the context of powershell.exe running it, could that be part of some script? Maybe trying to gather user information.\n\nAnother thing I see is file creations and image loads. There's a mention of MpClient.dll being loaded by PowerShell. That's from Windows Defender, which is legitimate, so probably not an issue. But there are other files like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive being created—wonder what that's for. Could be part of normal profile loading, but I'm not sure.\n\nRegistry events are also frequent across various processes. Registry access can be malicious if it's modifying sensitive areas, but without knowing exactly what's being changed, it's hard to say. Some processes like RuntimeBroker.exe and svchost.exe accessing the registry might just be part of normal operations.\n\nI also notice that winlogbeat.exe is present. That's likely related to log management, so maybe this is part of data collection for logs, which in itself isn't malicious but could be used by attackers if compromised.\n\nThe variety of processes like notepad.exe and calc.exe with their own tasks doesn't raise many flags on their own. They're common apps, and their activities are standard.\n\nPutting it all together, while there's a lot going on with PowerShell and some potentially suspicious activity like repeated whoami.exe calls, I don't see clear indicators of malicious behavior. It could be normal admin tasks or scripts running. However, the volume of PowerShell activity might warrant closer inspection to rule out any hidden malicious commands.\n\nSo, my classification would be INTERESTING because of the multiple PowerShell instances and registry modifications, but without concrete evidence of compromise, it's not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe and other processes performing actions such as process creation, file operations, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... It looks like it's setting up some configuration file, maybe for the winlogbeat service itself. That doesn't seem suspicious on its own; log management tools often create and update their config files.\n\nNext, there are two events from powershell.exe accessing something. I know that PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. But in this case, it's just 'Process accessed', which could be anything—maybe an admin running some script or even legitimate activity. Without more context on what exactly was done, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run from the system32 directory, which is normal since that's a standard Windows binary. It's often used to check user permissions and shouldn't raise any red flags by itself.\n\nLooking further down, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values might be concerning because those are common processes but they shouldn't need to modify the registry much. However, these events could just be part of their normal operation or some legitimate configuration change.\n\nThe bulk of the logs are from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. While multiple network connections can sometimes indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication, in this case, they're all coming from Chrome, which is a browser. Users browsing the web naturally generate these events. The repeated DNS queries could be due to multiple tabs or extensions being active. Similarly, the network connections are part of normal internet usage.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity across the batch. Most events are related to legitimate system operations or user activities like browsing. While there's some use of PowerShell and whoami.exe, which could be concerning, without additional context or more specific actions being logged, they aren't enough to classify this as suspicious.
