{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Let me go through each one to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nFirst, several chrome.exe processes are making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since browsers do that frequently.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe accessing the registry isn't unusual either; many apps interact with the registry.\n\nPowershell.exe is involved a couple of times—process access and creation. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so I'll keep an eye on its usage here.\n\nLooking at calc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that's odd because Calculator usually doesn't load such DLLs. It might just be coincidence, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, the cmd.exe command lines stand out. They're creating scheduled tasks using schtasks with commands that run calc.exe on startup or logon. This is concerning because it suggests persistence mechanisms—malware often uses this to ensure it runs every time the system starts up.\n\nThere are multiple instances where schtasks.exe is used to create new tasks, all pointing to cmd.exe running calc.exe. This repeated activity is a red flag for potential malicious behavior. Scheduled tasks can be legitimate but in bulk and with specific commands, it's more suspicious.\n\nsvchost.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. Since svchost is a common process but often used by malware for persistence or privilege escalation, this adds to the concern.\n\nAlso, cmd.exe and conhost.exe are seen creating registry values. While they can be legitimate, combined with other activities, it raises suspicion.\n\nThe repeated file creations under C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks with names like pacote_secundario_005_OnLogon by svchost.exe are unusual. These tasks might be setting up malicious startup points.\n\nOverall, the combination of creating numerous scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe on startup\/logon, using svchost for registry modifications, and other process creations points towards potential malware activity aiming for persistence and system compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including repeated creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe on startup\/logon, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and unusual file creations. These activities suggest potential malicious behavior aiming for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event one by one and see if anything stands out.\n\nFirst, there are several events where different processes like svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe are setting registry values. Registry modifications can be tricky because legitimate software often does that, but too many in a short time might indicate something malicious. However, I notice that most of these events involve common system processes, so maybe they're just normal operations.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is usually used for log shipping, so if it's running as expected, this shouldn't be suspicious. But the path mentioned is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. I wonder why there's a .new suffix—maybe it's just an update or a backup file being created.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe accessing registry values and loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Chrome is a common application, so these activities could be part of its normal operation, especially since it often interacts with system components.\n\nOne event that caught my eye is powershell.exe creating the file C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\unidade_ativo.txt. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers for scripting. Creating files can be innocent, but combined with other actions, it might raise flags. However, in this batch, there's no indication of any malicious commands or unusual access patterns from powershell.\n\nAnother event shows whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to its standard path. Whoami is a common utility used to display user information, so unless it's part of an escalation chain, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting this all together, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious activity across the batch. The events seem to be a mix of normal system operations and standard application behaviors. There are no signs of privilege escalation, file deletions, or other red flags typically associated with cyberattacks. While some processes could be potentially suspicious on their own, without additional context or more concerning actions, this batch doesn't merit immediate investigation.\n\nI'm also considering whether the volume of events might indicate something, but given that most are from chrome.exe and are standard operations, it's likely just normal traffic. Therefore, I would classify this batch as not interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing routine actions such as registry modifications and file creations. There are no signs of malicious activity or anomalies in the logged actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
