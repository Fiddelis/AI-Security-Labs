{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events where powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines. The command lines look like they're creating scheduled tasks that run calc.exe at login. That's suspicious because using powershell to create tasks can be a common tactic in malware or scripts meant to persistence on a system.\n\nLooking deeper, the commands are setting up scheduled tasks with parameters that give them high privileges under the Administrators group. This might indicate an attempt to elevate privileges or ensure the task runs with maximum permissions, which is often a red flag for malicious activity.\n\nThere are multiple events with similar command lines but different task names: unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc. The repetition suggests this isn't just a one-time script but something being deployed across several tasks, possibly to avoid detection or ensure persistence in different ways.\n\nOther events show powershell.exe accessing the registry (RegistryEvent) and processes being created (ProcessCreate). These are common activities during malicious scripting where attackers set up registry entries for persistence or create new processes to hide their tracks.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and accesses the registry. While less immediately concerning than powershell activity, it's worth noting as sometimes legitimate applications can be used in unexpected ways, but it's still something to monitor.\n\nThe last few events involve images loaded by powershell.exe, specifically mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are part of the .NET framework and usually benign, but their loading alongside other suspicious activities could be worth looking into for context.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell with administrative privileges to create multiple scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe is concerning. This pattern aligns with tactics used in cyberattacks for persistence and lateral movement. While there's no direct evidence of malicious intent here, the combination of events raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and calc.exe execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe loading various DLL files. This is common since PowerShell often uses .NET components. However, the specific DLLs mentioned seem legitimate and part of standard Windows operations. So that's not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen there's a file creation and subsequent deletion of a PowerShell script in the user's Temp directory. The naming looks like it might be related to script policy testing, which could be normal admin activity or part of an automated process. But combined with other events, this could raise a flag.\n\nNext, I see a command line for powershell.exe executing a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges. This is suspicious because creating a scheduled task to run a calculator (a common executable) during logon might be a way to hide malicious activity or persistence. It's unusual to see this in legitimate use, especially when paired with other anomalies.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple registry writes from chrome.exe. While Chrome does modify the registry for updates and settings, several entries at once could indicate something fishy, like a potential persistence mechanism or unauthorized changes. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events where the process name is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This is concerning because having remote command executions logged with no associated process could indicate unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network. These entries stand out as potential signs of an active attack or unauthorized activity.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple red flags: suspicious PowerShell commands, file operations in Temp, scheduled tasks running at logon with high privileges, and remote command executions without known processes. The combination suggests possible malicious activities like persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or lateral movement. Even though some events could be benign, the overall pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell command execution, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, and remote command executions with no associated process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries with the task \"Execute a Remote Command.\" These are repeated multiple times without any additional context. While executing remote commands can be suspicious, especially in large numbers, the lack of other details makes it hard to assess immediate risk here.\n\nThen there's an event where PowerShell.exe is used to create a scheduled task. The command line shows that it's setting up a new task action to execute calc.exe at logon with high privileges. This stands out because creating a persistent task with admin rights could be malicious, allowing persistence and privilege escalation.\n\nNext, I see WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WMI is often used in attacks for remote command execution, so this might indicate an attempt to create or modify scheduled tasks, which ties back to the earlier PowerShell activity.\n\nThere are multiple entries from svchost.exe modifying registry values and creating files. Svchost.exe is a common process but can be abused by malware. The repeated registry modifications could be signs of malicious activity trying to establish persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAnother event involves Chrome.exe loading various DLLs, which in itself isn't unusual, but it's worth noting if there are other indicators related to the browser being exploited or misused.\n\nLastly, events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating files might be part of legitimate operations, like log shipping or script execution. However, without more context, they're harder to judge as suspicious on their own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of remote command executions, the creation of a potentially malicious scheduled task using PowerShell, WMI activity, and unusual svchost.exe behavior are red flags. These indicators suggest possible malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, and system configuration changes. Therefore, this batch is highly interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including remote command execution attempts, suspicious PowerShell activity creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges, WMI process loading system files, and multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values. These repeated entries might be normal since Chrome often modifies settings through registry changes. However, multiple such events could indicate something suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThen there's an event where \"winlogbeat.exe\" created a file at the path specified. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping and should be legitimate on a system running Windows logs. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new seems routine, possibly during configuration updates or backups. No immediate red flags here.\n\nNext, there's an event from \"powershell.exe\" creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. A new file created by PowerShell could be part of script execution, which might not always be suspicious, but it's worth looking into the context of how this file was created. The filename doesn't immediately suggest anything malicious, but it's also not a common one.\n\nConsidering the entire batch together: multiple registry writes from Chrome, which are generally benign; a log file creation by winlogbeat, which is expected; and a new file via PowerShell that might be part of normal operations or something more nefarious. Without additional information on timestamps, user activity, or other related events, it's challenging to definitively classify this batch as malicious.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple registry changes and a file creation by an elevated process (Powershell) could warrant further investigation. While not conclusive evidence of malicious activity, these events are notable enough to merit closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple Registry modifications from chrome.exe and file creations by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe may indicate potential malicious activity or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
