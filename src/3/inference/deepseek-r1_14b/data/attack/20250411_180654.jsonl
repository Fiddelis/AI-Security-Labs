{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That seems a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry frequently, especially not that many times in a row. I wonder why it's making so many changes—could it be related to some extension or update?\n\nThen, there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate tool, but its use can sometimes indicate privilege escalation attempts if used inappropriately. It's worth noting because knowing user information could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe main red flags are the powershell.exe processes. There are several instances where PowerShell is being run with command lines that execute scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That script name sounds suspicious—it might be designed to capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging. The fact that it's being executed multiple times and with different paths suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, the PowerShell processes are loading various .NET assemblies. While this isn't inherently suspicious, combined with the execution of scripts known for malicious purposes, it adds to the concern. Malware often uses legitimate tools and libraries to hide its activities.\n\nThe last two events mention 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks related to powershell.exe executing similar keystroke-capturing scripts. This repetition reinforces the idea that something is amiss—why would multiple processes need to execute the same script unless it's part of a larger, possibly malicious campaign?\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with potentially harmful scripts, along with unusual registry modifications by Chrome and the execution of whoami.exe, makes this batch of logs stand out. These activities could indicate a cyberattack, such as keylogging or persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) along with unusual process and registry activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that reference different paths leading to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. This script name suggests it might be related to capturing keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware for keylogging. The fact that the same script is called from various paths like C:\\objeto_secundario\\tarefa_padrao... and others makes me think this could be part of a malicious payload trying different directories or obfuscating its origin.\n\nLooking further, some events show powershell.exe loading different files, such as MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. These are legitimate Windows Defender components, so that might not be suspicious on its own, but paired with the other activity, it's worth noting.\n\nThere's an event where a file is created under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 and then immediately deleted. This behavior could indicate a script checking if it can run without being detected or trying to bypass certain policies by testing the environment before executing malicious code.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe created in powershell.exe, which is normal for inter-process communication but could also be used for command and control within malware.\n\nThere's an entry from conhost.exe setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows, but any unexpected registry changes should raise an eyebrow as potential indicators of malicious activity.\n\nAn event mentions executing a remote command via powershell.exe, which can be a red flag if it's not expected or well-known in the system. Additionally, there's a file creation by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely from the ELK stack for log management, so probably benign unless it's doing something unusual.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe creating a file sounds normal since it's a common service host process, but again, context matters. The presence of multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines and activities like file creation\/deletion could collectively indicate malicious behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, the repeated use of powershell.exe to execute keyloggers from various paths, coupled with environment testing and unexpected registry changes, points towards potential malicious activity. This batch definitely warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts named Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which are commonly associated with keylogging malware. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion events in the temp directory, and registry modifications by conhost.exe, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's break down each event.\n\nThe first event shows svchost.exe creating a file in the NetworkService profile directory. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware. The path seems a bit deep, which could be suspicious, especially since it's creating a new file.\n\nNext, there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is typically associated with log management and might be part of the system's monitoring tools. However, if it's creating files in user directories like Downloads, that's unusual unless it's configured to do so, which could indicate tampering or unauthorized activity.\n\nThe third event involves powershell.exe, known for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. The file being created is in the Downloads folder, which isn't inherently suspicious on its own, but combined with the other events, especially from svchost and winlogbeat, it raises flags about potential scripting or payload deployment.\n\nPutting them together, each event involves different processes creating files in unexpected locations. Svchost.exe is often a red flag because of its dual use, while powershell.exe adds another layer of concern due to its common exploitation by attackers. Winlogbeat's involvement could indicate attempts to cover tracks or disrupt logging mechanisms. The combination suggests possible malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or log tampering.\n\nSo, considering all three events together, the pattern looks concerning. There's a mix of processes known for both legitimate and malicious purposes creating files in areas that aren't their usual operating environments. This could signal an attack, such as credential dumping, lateral movement, or setting up persistence points.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple system processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in unexpected locations, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
