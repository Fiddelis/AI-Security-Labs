{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving processes like chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal since Chrome is a web browser that does that regularly. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen, I notice powershell.exe appearing several times with tasks like ProcessAccess and Registry value sets. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's accessing processes and modifying the registry could be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are also cmd.exe commands adding users and groups in the domain. For example:\n- net user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" \"registro_temporario_pass123!\\\" \/add \/domain\n- net group \"Domain Admins\" \"modulo_comum_Admin\" \/add \/domain\n\nThese look like they're creating new users and adding them to the Domain Admins group. If these accounts aren't supposed to exist, this could indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to gain higher-level access. This is definitely concerning.\n\nI also see cmd.exe and net1.exe being used in similar ways. The command lines are a bit hard to read, but they seem to be adding users and groups again. This repetition makes me think there's a pattern hereâ€”maybe someone is trying to create multiple backdoor accounts or expand their access within the domain.\n\nLooking further down, there are file creation events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating specific files. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component for log shipping, so that seems benign unless it's being misused. The powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_base.txt might be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated creation of SRUtmp.log by svchost.exe. This file is related to system restore and volume shadow copies. While this process is legitimate, frequent writes could indicate tampering with system restore points, which can be a sign of malware trying to hide its tracks.\n\nConsidering all these events together:\n- Creation of multiple domain admin accounts via command-line tools.\n- Use of powershell.exe for registry modifications and process access.\n- File creations that might be part of malicious activities.\n- Potential manipulation of system restore functionality.\n\nThese indicators point towards possible unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or the establishment of persistence mechanisms. The combination suggests a comprehensive attack rather than isolated incidents, making the batch highly interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential unauthorized user creation and domain admin group modifications, along with suspicious use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for registry changes. This suggests possible privilege escalation or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
