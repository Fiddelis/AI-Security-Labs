{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few lines involve processes like svchost.exe and chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. These are pretty common activities for many applications, especially browsers, so I'm not too worried about those yet. They don't stand out as malicious by themselves.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process being created. That seems normal; it's often used to check user permissions or just for legitimate system tasks. But later on, I see multiple powershell.exe processes accessing and modifying registry values, which is a bit concerning because PowerShell can be misused for malicious activities, like executing scripts or changing system configurations.\n\nLooking further down, there are several cmd.exe instances with command lines that create users and groups in the domain. The commands use \"\/add \/domain\" flags, which suggests they're adding new user accounts and groups across the network. The usernames and passwords look suspicious: \"pacote_principal_Admin\", \"registro_temporario_pass123!\", etc. These are not following strong security practices, but I need to check if this is part of legitimate administration or something malicious.\n\nI also notice net.exe and net1.exe being used with similar commands. It's a bit odd that both are used; maybe someone tried different tools for the same purpose. The fact that they're creating domain users and groups might indicate privilege escalation or setting up accounts for lateral movement in the network.\n\nThere are events where conhost.exe writes to the registry, which is another red flag. Conhost is often associated with command-line tools like cmd.exe, but it can sometimes be used by malware to maintain persistence or hide processes.\n\nAdditionally, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating files, which seems okay if it's part of log management software. But the paths look correct, so maybe nothing to worry about here unless it's unexpected behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows several high-privilege operations using tools like PowerShell and command prompt with suspicious commands. The creation of multiple admin-level users and groups could be a sign of an active directory compromise or setting up backdoor accounts. These activities are indicative of potential unauthorized access or credential stuffing.\n\nI'm not 100% certain, but the combination of these events is enough to raise concern. It's possible that someone with administrative privileges is performing legitimate tasks, but given the unusual naming conventions and multiple attempts with different tools, it's more likely malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple high-privilege operations using suspicious commands to create users and groups in the domain, which may indicate potential unauthorized access or credential compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Svchost is a common Windows process, often part of legitimate services, but sometimes used by malware. However, this could be normal system activity since SRUtmp.log is related to the System Resource Usage Monitor.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file in a user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is likely the Elastic winlogbeat agent, which collects logs. This seems routine as it's part of its data collection process, especially if it's during an update or configuration change.\n\nThe third and fourth events both involve powershell.exe. The first PowerShell event sets a registry value, and the second shows a process access. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administration tasks but can also be abused by attackers. Registry modifications could be part of persistence mechanisms or malicious configurations. Process access events might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nPutting it all together: two normal events from svchost and winlogbeat, which are expected. But the two PowerShell events raise a red flag. The combination of registry changes and process access is concerning because these actions can be indicators of malicious activity like creating persistence points or attempting to elevate privileges. While not conclusive on their own, the presence of multiple such events in a batch could suggest a potential threat.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as INTERESTING with high confidence due to the suspicious PowerShell activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes two suspicious PowerShell events involving registry modifications and process access, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
