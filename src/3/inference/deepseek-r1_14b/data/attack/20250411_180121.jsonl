{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first few entries are from chrome.exe with network connections and DNS queries, which seems normal because Chrome does a lot of networking.\n\nThen things get interesting when powershell.exe shows up multiple times. The command lines in the process events show that PowerShell is downloading files from various GitHub repositories into the Temp directory. That's a red flag because downloading files via PowerShell without clear justification can be malicious.\n\nI also notice multiple instances where files are created and then deleted, like __PSScriptPolicyTest.ps1. This pattern suggests an attempt to execute scripts temporarily, which could be part of a script-based attack.\n\nLooking at the Registry events and ImageLoad tasks in powershell.exe, it indicates that the process is loading several .NET framework components, possibly to hide its activities or execute malicious code.\n\nThe repeated Provider Lifecycle task without any obvious legitimate purpose adds to the suspicion. This could be related to persistence mechanisms or service installations.\n\nPutting it all together, these events suggest potential unauthorized execution of scripts downloaded from external sources, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks. The combination of downloading files, creating\/deleting temporary script files, and registry modifications points towards malicious activity that merits investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show command lines with WebClient.DownloadFile calls to external GitHub URLs, indicative of potential malicious script downloads.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process with a command line that downloads a file from GitHub into the TEMP directory. That immediately raises a red flag because downloading files via PowerShell can be a common tactic for malicious activities. I should note the URLs and see if they look suspicious. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different repositories, which seems odd because attackers might use legitimate-looking filenames to hide their tracks.\n\nThe second event is another PowerShell process with a similar command line, downloading from a different GitHub path. This repetition makes me think it's part of a script or batch process, possibly trying to download multiple files or modules. The fact that both are using Webclient.DownloadFile and saving to TEMP suggests they might be dropping files there for execution.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell creates a pipe. Pipes in PowerShell can be used for communication between processes, but in the context of these downloads, it could be setting up a way to receive commands or data after the files are downloaded. This is a bit concerning because it might indicate a backdoor or command-and-control communication.\n\nThen there's an event where a file was created by PowerShell at a specific path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. The filename seems generic, but combined with the previous downloads, this could be part of a payload being written to disk. It's possible that these files are malicious scripts or tools.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, repeated writes might indicate something amiss, especially if they're outside the usual patterns. However, compared to the PowerShell activities, this seems less suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's an event where a file was created by winlogbeat.exe, which is likely related to log shipping or monitoring tools. This doesn't seem malicious unless there's evidence of tampering with logs, but in this case, it appears normal.\n\nAnother event shows MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection. That's expected behavior for Windows Defender as it communicates with Microsoft servers for updates and threat intelligence. No red flags here.\n\nThe RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe events also modifying registry values aren't particularly worrying unless they're part of a larger pattern. Notepad is commonly used, so its activity alone isn't concerning.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from GitHub into TEMP, creating pipes, and writing to disk suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated downloads and the specific paths make me think it's a script attempting to gather or deploy something. While there are some benign events, the volume of suspicious PowerShell activities stands out.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of JSONL Events for Potential Malicious Activity**\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities:**\n   - **Event 1:** PowerShell downloads a file from GitHub into TEMP using Webclient.DownloadFile. The filename (LICENSE.txt) is generic but could be malicious.\n   - **Event 2:** Another PowerShell process downloads a different file, suggesting a script or batch process.\n   - **Event 3:** PowerShell creates a pipe, possibly for communication, indicating potential command-and-control activity.\n\n2. **File Creation:**\n   - **Event 4:** A file (elemento_padrao.txt) is created in Downloads by PowerShell, which might be part of a payload or malicious script.\n\n3. **Chrome Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Events 5-8:** Multiple registry writes by chrome.exe. While normal, repeated writes could indicate unusual behavior but are less concerning than the PowerShell activities.\n\n4. **Benign Activities:**\n   - **Event 9:** winlogbeat.exe creates a file, likely for log shipping.\n   - **Event 10:** MpDefenderCoreService.exe makes a network connection, expected for updates.\n   - **Events 11-12:** RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modify registry values, which are generally benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe batch shows multiple suspicious activities involving PowerShell downloading files and creating pipes, suggesting potential malicious behavior. While other events are mostly benign, the repeated and specific actions by PowerShell warrant further investigation into possible exploitation or command-and-control activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide whether they indicate something malicious or not.\n\nLooking at the first few events: there's a process named 'calc.exe' loading 'urlmon.dll'. That seems normal because calc.exe is a standard calculator app and urlmon.dll is part of Windows for handling URLs. But then, I notice that 'svchost.exe' is modifying registry values multiple times. Wait, svchost is usually a legitimate host process for services, so why is it making changes to the registry? That could be normal or suspicious depending on what's being changed.\n\nNext, there are several entries where 'powershell.exe' is accessed. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers because it can execute commands and scripts. The fact that it's accessed multiple times might raise a red flag. But sometimes legitimate admins use it too, so I need to look at the context.\n\nThere's also a process named 'whoami.exe' being created with a command line that looks normalâ€”it's just running whoami without any suspicious flags. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nThen I see 'cmd.exe' being used in some commands. For example, there's a SCHTASKS command to delete a scheduled task and another command deleting registry entries related to the Run key. That seems like someone is trying to remove traces of their activity or clean up after installing malware. Also, using REG DELETE to remove entries from HKCU\\Run might indicate an attempt to prevent the system from running certain programs at startup.\n\nLooking further, there's 'schtasks.exe' deleting a task and 'reg.exe' modifying the registry as well. These are tools that can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, but in this context, multiple deletions of scheduled tasks and registry entries might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or disable security mechanisms.\n\nAnother thing I notice is repeated process creations for 'powershell.exe', 'whoami.exe', 'cmd.exe', and others. This could indicate a script being run multiple times or part of a larger automated process. While not inherently malicious, it's worth looking into why these processes are being spawned so frequently.\n\nPutting this all together: there's a pattern of using legitimate tools (like PowerShell, cmd, reg) to perform actions that seem like they're trying to remove traces or disable certain features. The combination of registry modifications and deletion of scheduled tasks could be part of an attempt to make the system less secure or hide malicious activities.\n\nI'm leaning towards thinking this might be suspicious because it's a series of potentially harmful actions using tools known for their flexibility in both good and bad uses. However, without more context on when these events occurred and what exactly was modified, it's hard to say definitively. But the frequency and nature of these changes do raise concerns about possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a series of activities that, while not conclusive evidence of malicious intent, present several red flags indicative of potential cybersecurity concerns. The repeated use of legitimate tools such as PowerShell, cmd.exe, and reg.exe to perform actions like deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and accessing system processes suggests a pattern that could be associated with efforts to conceal activity or compromise system integrity.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Registry Modifications:** Multiple entries show changes to the registry, particularly deletions from HKCU\\Run, which may indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms used by malware.\n2. **Scheduled Task Deletion:** Use of SCHTASKS to delete tasks could be part of an effort to remove malicious scripts or tools installed on the system.\n3. **Frequent Process Creations:** The repeated spawning of processes like PowerShell and cmd.exe might suggest automated or script-based activity, often a tactic used in attacks.\n4. **Legitimate Tools for Illicit Use:** While these tools have legitimate uses, their use in conjunction with potentially harmful actions raises suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe observed activities are sufficiently concerning to warrant further investigation. They demonstrate behaviors consistent with those seen in cyberattacks, such as system modification and cleanup routines to avoid detection. To mitigate risks, it's advisable to conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system, review the changes made, and consider implementing additional security measures to detect and prevent similar activities in the future.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nThe events are deemed suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of these actions and ensure system integrity. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"assessment\": {\n    \"status\": \"suspicious\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"registry_modifications\": true,\n      \"scheduled_task_deletions\": true,\n      \"frequent_process_creations\": true,\n      \"potential_malware_cleaning\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. These are pretty standard for PowerShell activity, so maybe not suspicious on their own. But the frequency might be worth noting.\n\nThere's a Process Create event for powershell.exe, which is normal when starting a new script or command. Then there are several Registry value set events from powershell.exe. That catches my attention because modifying the registry can be a red flag if done unexpectedly, but it's also common in legitimate scripts.\n\nLooking at the file paths, most of them are system files like mscoree.dll and others under Windows directories. These are expected when running PowerShell as they're part of the framework. However, there's a File Created event for a temporary PS script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 in the user's Temp folder. That's concerning because scripts in temp can be malicious. But then it gets deleted right after, which is another red flagâ€”malware often deletes its traces.\n\nAnother event shows File Created and then File Delete logged for the same script. This behavior might indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic for attackers. Additionally, there are Pipe Created events, which can be used for communication between processes. Powershell sometimes uses pipes, but in certain attacks, they might create named pipes for malicious purposes.\n\nI also notice that some events have command_line as 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an attempt to run powershell without any arguments or perhaps a way to obfuscate the actual command. This could be a sign of script execution or process injection.\n\nLooking at the user context, the file paths mention \"fiddelis\" in the username. If this is a known user, it might not be suspicious, but if there's no prior knowledge, any unusual activity from that user should be flagged.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple powershell.exe processes accessing the registry, creating and deleting temporary scripts, using pipesâ€”these behaviors collectively could indicate malicious activity. While some events individually aren't alarming, their combination raises concerns about potential attack vectors like script execution, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes accessing registry values and creating\/deleting temporary scripts in the user's Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of system log events in JSONL format and wants me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're relevant for investigation. I need to classify the entire batch as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", provide a justification, and assign a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances of 'whoami.exe' being executed. Whoami is typically used to display user information and isn't inherently malicious, but repeated use might indicate probing or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nNext, I notice several entries for 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The events show process access, registry modifications, image loads, file creation, and deletion. Specifically, there's a script being created and then deleted in the Temp folder. This could indicate script injection or an attempt to bypass certain security policies.\n\nThere are also 'cmd.exe' instances with empty command lines, which is unusual because cmd typically runs commands. An empty command line might mean it's used as a parent process for other activities or potentially to hide commands.\n\nRegistry modifications across multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe) could be signs of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that allow malware to maintain access or alter system settings.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks under powershell.exe are less clear but might relate to how PowerShell initializes or loads modules. This could also be a red flag if it's part of a larger suspicious activity chain.\n\nAdditionally, the file operations like creating and deleting a script file in the Temp directory within the same process context are concerning because attackers often use such techniques to execute malicious scripts temporarily to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple high-privilege processes (whoami, powershell), registry modifications, file operations, and repeated process creations with unusual command lines suggests potential malicious activity. While individual events might not be alarming, their cumulative nature raises red flags. The use of PowerShell for creating and deleting files in Temp could indicate script-based attacks or attempts to execute code without leaving a permanent trace.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern indicates possible malicious behavior. My confidence is high but not absolute (0.8) because while the indicators are concerning, they might also be part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, the repeated and varied activities across different processes make it more likely to be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing registry values, creating files in the Temp directory, and deleting them shortly after.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity from powershell.exe. It's performing various tasks like creating pipes, accessing processes, and modifying the registry. That's not uncommon, but the frequency might be worth noting. There are also multiple instances where powershell is being executed with command lines that involve removing files or interacting with system directories, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n\nI see that Calculator.exe and conhost.exe are involved in some registry writes. While these aren't typically malicious processes, any unexpected registry modifications could indicate tampering. The whoami.exe execution might be part of legitimate user activities, but it's also a common tool for attackers to check permissions or system information.\n\nThe logs show multiple file creations and image loads from powershell, which is normal for script execution, but the specific files being loaded don't raise immediate red flags unless they're known malicious libraries. The repeated registry writes across different processes could be part of persistence mechanisms, making this batch more concerning.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the activity seems suspicious enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities such as registry modifications, file creation, and process access.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm seeing a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with some process information, Windows log task details, and file data.\n\nFirst off, most of these events involve 'powershell.exe'. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. It's commonly targeted by attackers for its scripting capabilities and how it can execute commands.\n\nLooking at the specific actions: there are multiple instances where files are being created and then deleted in the TEMP directory. For example, I see events like \"File created\" followed by \"File Delete logged\". That seems suspicious because an attacker might create a script to perform malicious tasks and then delete evidence to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, several of these PowerShell commands are using the Remove-Item cmdlet to delete files from the TEMP directory. The command lines show paths like '$env:TEMP\\\\tarefa_base.zip' and similar patterns. The fact that multiple files with different names are being deleted makes me think this could be part of a larger script or loop, perhaps cleaning up after some activity.\n\nAnother point is the use of \"&\" in the command line, which allows chaining commands in PowerShell. This can make it harder to trace because each command is executed sequentially without showing intermediate results, potentially hiding malicious actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving 'chrome.exe' and 'whoami.exe', but those seem less concerning compared to the PowerShell activity. The Chrome events are about loading DLLs and registry changes, which could be normal or part of malicious behavior, but not as directly suspicious as the deletions from TEMP by PowerShell.\n\nThere's also a process named 'conhost.exe' which is usually used for running console applications in Windows. Itâ€™s not immediately alarming on its own unless it's being used for something malicious.\n\nThe overall pattern here suggests automated deletion of temporary files, possibly to remove traces of previous activities. This kind of behavior can be an indicator of malicious script execution where attackers don't want to leave evidence behind. The repeated use of PowerShell with similar command patterns adds to the suspicion.\n\nI'm also noticing that some events relate to registry changes and image loading, which are common in both legitimate software operations and malware activities for persistence or privilege escalation. However, combined with the file deletions, it raises the risk level.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes creating temporary files and then deleting them, along with other system interactions like registry modifications and process creation, makes this batch of events potentially indicative of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory, which may indicate malicious behavior such as evidence tampering or script execution.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are all related to powershell.exe being executed with specific commands. The command lines show things like removing files in the TEMP directory, which could be part of legitimate script execution or might indicate an attempt to clean up traces. Then there's a series of file accesses and image loads by powershell.exe, which is normal when scripts run, but sometimes attackers use these for lateral movement or persistence.\n\nI notice several events where powershell.exe creates temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory and then deletes them shortly after. This could be part of a script testing permissions or trying to avoid detection, which raises some red flags.\n\nThere's also an event where a new file is created by winlogbeat.exe, which I'm familiar withâ€”it's part of the ELK stack for log management. That seems benign on its own but might be used maliciously if compromised.\n\nLooking at other events, there are instances where whoami.exe is run, which could be used to gather system information. Additionally, processes like conhost.exe and powershell.exe accessing the registry or creating files might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or attempting privilege escalation.\n\nOverall, while some activities could be legitimate (like script execution or log management), the repeated use of powershell.exe with file deletions in the TEMP directory, combined with process creation and registry modifications, suggests potential malicious behavior.

That seems normal because Chrome often modifies the Windows registry for updates or settings changes. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen, I notice events from 'RuntimeBroker.exe', which is related to UWP app container processes. It accessing the registry doesn't sound unusual either; it's part of its standard operations.\n\nNext, there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' being accessed with ProcessAccess tasks. PowerShell can be legitimate for administration but could also be malicious if used in certain ways. The frequency here is a bit concerningâ€”multiple accesses without obvious cause might warrant closer look.\n\nThere are also multiple 'Process Create' events for 'whoami.exe', which is a system utility to display user information.
