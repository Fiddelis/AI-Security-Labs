Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple instances where PowerShell.exe is being accessed and created. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that it's being called several times could be a red flag, especially if the command lines are obfuscated or suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the events: \"& {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\" Start-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}\". This script is attempting to create a new service with the name \"objeto_ativo\" and set its binary path to an unusual location. The use of Portuguese comments in the command line (like \"#\\\\ac8d9bdd1d5d329adfe44a2bf5841c0b\") seems odd and possibly obfuscating the true purpose.\n\nI notice that there's a file creation event for \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\" followed immediately by its deletion. This behavior is concerning because it suggests an attempt to create and then remove a script, which might be part of evading detection mechanisms or testing the environment.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry writes from services.exe. While this isn't inherently suspicious on its own, combined with the PowerShell activity, it could indicate an attempt to persist malicious activities by modifying system configurations.\n\nThe events show several file loads and image loads related to .NET frameworks and Windows Defender components. These might be part of normal operations, but given the context of other actions, they could also serve as indicators of a more complex attack vector.\n\nOverall, the pattern of multiple PowerShell executions with potentially malicious command lines, coupled with file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and script testing, raises concerns about possible malicious activity. This batch of logs suggests an ongoing or attempted attack that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with suspicious command lines and activities indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by understanding each line and seeing if there's any pattern or suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are from processes like services.exe, tarefa_logico.exe, powershell.exe, MsMpEng.exe, and svchost.exe. The tasks vary between Registry value sets, Image loads, File creates, etc. \n\nStarting with the first event: 'services.exe' setting a registry value. That's common for system services, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are several events from 'tarefa_logico.exe', all related to image loading and specific DLLs like mscoree.dll and others in the .NET framework directory. This seems normal because these are standard system files being loaded by an executable.\n\nThen, I see powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive path. Powershell is often used for scripting and automation, but malicious scripts can also use it. However, without more context on what's inside that script, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries of services.exe setting registry values again—this might be part of legitimate service operations or could indicate something more if these changes aren't expected.\n\nLooking at the events from MsMpEng.exe and svchost.exe setting registry values: MsMpEng is related to Windows Defender, so that's likely normal. Svchost.exe is a common process for various services; multiple instances are typical and alone they don't raise red flags.\n\nThe last event is about creating a log file in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. That seems legitimate as system updates generate logs regularly.\n\nPutting it all together: I see a lot of standard processes performing normal operations—loading DLLs, setting registry values, creating files. No single event stands out as malicious, and there's no indication of unusual activity like multiple failed attempts, unauthorized access, or unexpected file creations. Therefore, the batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes such as service operations and legitimate file\/dll loading by known executables.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My job is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all involve 'svchost.exe' setting registry values. That's a common Windows process that's often associated with services. Registry modifications can be normal for legitimate software but could also be malicious. However, seeing multiple instances of this might raise an eyebrow.\n\nThen there are several events from 'setup.exe'. These show file creation activities in the EdgeCore directory. The files created include things like msedge.exe and others, which seem related to Microsoft Edge updates or installations. It's a bit suspicious because setup.exe is often used for installing software, but creating these specific files could be part of a legitimate update process.\n\nThere's also an event where 'RuntimeBroker.exe' sets a registry value. That's another common system process, so that might not be alarming on its own.\n\nConsidering the pattern, I notice multiple events from setup.exe creating files in known Microsoft Edge paths. This could indicate software installation or updates, which is normal. However, if these were malicious actors trying to install something, they might use similar filenames but different paths or times. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe fact that there are 18 events, mostly from setup.exe and svchost.exe doing registry writes and file creations, doesn't immediately scream red flags. It could just be a system update or some background process activity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events seem to revolve around legitimate software processes creating files and modifying registries. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior like multiple failed logins, access to sensitive files, or network connections. Therefore, while it's worth keeping an eye on, especially the number of registry writes, there's not enough evidence to classify this batch as definitely suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate system processes, including setup.exe creating files for Microsoft Edge and svchost.exe modifying registry values.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. The goal is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting enough for investigation or not. I'm supposed to look at all the events together and make a single classification.\n\nLet me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're all from 'svchost.exe' with tasks related to Registry value sets or object additions\/deletions. I know that svchost.exe is a common system process used by various services in Windows. It's not unusual for it to interact with the registry frequently as part of normal operations.\n\nContinuing down, there are entries from 'services.exe', which also handles service-related tasks and registry interactions, so again, these seem like standard activities. Then I notice some events from 'setup.exe' doing similar Registry operations, which makes sense if setup.exe is installing or configuring something on the system.\n\nThe interesting part comes towards the end of the log batch. There are a couple of entries where 'setup.exe' creates files in specific locations:\n- 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge_proxy.exe'\n- 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\pwahelper.exe'\n\nThese paths look like they're part of the Microsoft Edge installation. The creation of these files could be normal during an update or installation process. However, another event shows a pipe created by setup.exe, which might indicate some form of inter-process communication.\n\nThen there are two more file creation events pointing to shortcut files in different locations:\n- 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\Microsoft Edge.lnk'\n- 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Microsoft Edge.lnk'\n\nThese are just shortcuts, so they seem benign. However, the fact that setup.exe is creating them might be part of a legitimate installation or update process.\n\nPutting this all together, most of the events are normal Registry and file operations from standard system processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. These activities don't raise any red flags on their own. However, the creation of specific Edge-related files and shortcuts by setup.exe could indicate something malicious if these files aren't supposed to be there or if they're being modified after a certain point.\n\nI'm considering whether this activity is within normal bounds for system updates or installations. If the system was recently updated or had software installed, these actions would make sense. But without additional context about when and why setup.exe is running, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't too high because while some of the events are unusual in combination (like creating multiple specific files), they might still be part of legitimate processes. However, the creation of those Edge-related files stands out a bit more than typical system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry interactions and file creations by setup.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events from setup.exe performing Registry operations. There are multiple entries where it's setting registry values and creating pipes. Setup.exe is commonly used during software installations or updates, so these could be normal activities. However, the repetition might raise an eyebrow—why would setup.exe perform the same Registry actions multiple times? It could be a sign of something unusual.\n\nNext, there are events from RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry as well. Runtime Broker is related to Windows Runtime and can sometimes be involved in malicious activities, but it's also legitimate for certain operations. I'll need to check if these tasks are typical for this process or if they might indicate tampering.\n\nThen, several svchost.exe processes are creating files in the Temp directory with strange file names like APPX followed by random strings. Svchost is a common system process, often used by services and can be a vector for malware. The creation of multiple temporary files could be part of legitimate operations, but the naming seems suspicious—APPX usually relates to app packages. Malware might create such files to hide their activities.\n\nLooking at the file paths: some are in C:\\Windows\\Temp, which is standard, but others like C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\S-1-5-18 look unusual. I'm not sure what process would create files there, and it doesn't ring a bell as a common system path. This could be an indicator of malicious behavior trying to establish persistence or drop files in unexpected locations.\n\nPutting this all together: setup.exe's repeated Registry changes and pipe creations, along with svchost.exe creating suspicious temp files, suggest potential malicious activity. The combination of multiple processes (setup.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe) engaging in such actions is concerning. It seems like an attacker might be using these legitimate processes to hide their tracks or execute malicious tasks.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole shows signs that could indicate malicious behavior, making it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by setup.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from svchost.exe creating files in the AppReadiness folder. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, often used by services. The files being created have paths with S-1-5-... which look like security identifiers. These might be related to user profiles or token operations.\n\nThen there are several Registry value sets from svchost.exe. Modifying the registry isn't unusual, but I should check if these changes are expected during normal operation or if they're anomalies.\n\nLater in the logs, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe with an execution policy set to Restricted and a command that writes 'Final result: 1' to the host. That seems concerning because PowerShell is often used maliciously, especially when coupled with restricted policies which might hide its activity. The subsequent image load events from powershell.exe show it loading .NET framework components, which could be normal, but in this context, after a potentially suspicious command execution, it raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe activities are somewhat normal, but the powershell.exe process with a restricted policy and an external command is a red flag. This combination suggests possible malicious activity, like executing commands without user consent or using PowerShell to hide traces.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe creating files in the AppReadiness folder and modifying registry values, followed by a powershell.exe process with an execution policy set to Restricted executing a command.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the events are from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and script-based attacks. So seeing multiple instances where it's being executed might indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: there are ImageLoad events, which mean new images (DLLs) are being loaded into memory. This could be normal, but if they're loading a lot of different DLLs, especially from non-standard paths, that might be suspicious. Also, there are FileCreate events where files are being created in temporary directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp. Temporary files can be used to store malicious scripts or tools.\n\nOne event stands out: the process create for whoami.exe. That's a legitimate system command often used by attackers to check user permissions. But when combined with powershell.exe activity, it might suggest that someone is trying to gather information about the system before executing commands.\n\nAnother important point is the command line in one of the events where powershell.exe is run with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That's unusual because scripts usually require a less restrictive policy to execute, but maybe they're trying to bypass some restrictions or test script execution capabilities.\n\nThe files being loaded include various DLLs from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender directories. While these are legitimate, the repeated loading might indicate that something is dynamically injecting code into PowerShell processes, which could be malicious.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This seems like it could be a persistence mechanism or storing configuration data for later execution.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there's a pattern of extensive PowerShell usage with potentially malicious intent. The combination of process creation, image loading, file creation, and command-line arguments that check system configurations suggests possible lateral movement, information gathering, or payload deployment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes show extensive script execution attempts including file creations in temporary directories, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event shows PowerShell.exe loading a specific DLL file from Windows Defender. That might seem normal because PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks and sometimes attackers use it as well. But on its own, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious.\n\nThen there are events where cmd.exe runs a command that uses Dism.exe with some parameters: \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet. That looks like someone is trying to disable Windows Defender features. I know that attackers might try to turn off antivirus or other security tools to avoid detection, but sometimes legitimate users might do this too for troubleshooting or performance reasons.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events from Dism.exe accessing various DLL files and creating new files in a temp directory. The paths like AppData\\Local\\Temp with specific filenames seem unusual. These actions could be part of a legitimate process, especially since Dism is used for servicing Windows, but generating so many temporary files without clear reason might raise flags.\n\nI notice that several events mention file creation and executable detection by Dism.exe. This could indicate the extraction or unpacking of malicious payloads, where an attacker uses Dism to execute commands and create files as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these together, it seems like someone is attempting to manipulate system defenses by disabling Windows Defender and creating temporary files that might be used for malicious purposes. The combination of using cmd.exe with Dism to modify system features and the subsequent file activities in the temp directory suggest potential compromise or unauthorized access attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show attempts to disable Windows Defender and create temporary files, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, looking at the \"process\" field, they all say 'Dism.exe'. I know that Dism is related to Windows deployment services, used for installing and configuring Windows. It's a legitimate system process, so that doesn't raise red flags immediately.\n\nThe \"winlog\" task in each event mentions \"File Executable Detected\", which sounds like it's monitoring the creation or execution of files. The rule is \"FileExecutableDetected\". This seems like part of Windows' own security mechanisms to track executable file activities.\n\nNow, looking at the files being logged. All paths are under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\en-US\\', and each has a .mui extension. MUI stands for Multi-Use Information, often used in localization files for Windows components. These aren't executables but resource files.\n\nWait a minute—if these are just file access events during normal operations (like installing or configuring something with Dism), then why are they being flagged? Maybe the system is logging every time it accesses these files as part of its usual process, especially when dealing with localization data.\n\nI also notice that each event has a different filename ending with .mui. It looks like Dism.exe is accessing several resource files in sequence. Since Dism is part of Windows, and MUI files are standard for localization, this seems more like normal system behavior rather than malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, all events share the same structure: same process name, same log task, and similar file paths with only filenames varying. This homogeneity suggests it's not an attack where varied processes or unexpected files would appear.\n\nSo, considering all these points—legitimate process, standard logging of non-executable resource files during system operations, repetitive and expected behavior—it doesn't seem like there's any malicious intent here. Therefore, this batch isn't particularly concerning from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"interesting_score\": 0,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events are related to normal Windows deployment services activity involving the Dism.exe process accessing localization resource files.

The goal is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nLooking at each line, they all have similar structures. They mention a process named \"Dism.exe\", which stands out because I know that Dism is related to Windows deployment services. It's usually used during the installation or configuration of Windows, like when setting up a new system or adding features.\n\nEach event also has a winlog indicating that an executable file was detected, specifically mentioning the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". The files being detected are all DLLs in various subfolders under a temporary path. These paths include things like \"en-US\" and specific provider names like \"SmiProvider\", \"SysprepProvider\", etc.\n\nSo, putting this together: Dism.exe is executing these DLL files from a temporary directory. Since Dism is a legitimate Windows tool, it's normal for it to interact with various system files during its operations. The repeated detection of executables by the same process in the same location suggests that this is part of a standard setup or maintenance routine.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. There's no indication that these DLLs are unauthorized or behaving abnormally. They all seem to be expected components used by Dism.exe during its normal operations.\n\nTherefore, while each event on its own might raise an eyebrow because it's a file execution event, the combination and context (all from Dism.exe in a temp directory) make me confident that this is not malicious but rather part of normal Windows system activities.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events have the same process name: Dism.exe. That's a known system file related to Windows Deployment Services, used for installing and configuring Windows. So it's a legitimate process running on a system.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most of these events are about file deletions logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. There's also one event where the task is \"File creation time changed\" with the rule FileCreateTime. These seem like they're monitoring changes to files.\n\nThe file paths in all events point to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\...AppData\\Local\\Temp. The specific directory name is long and looks random, which is common for temporary files. The files being deleted are DLLs and MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files, such as DismCore.dll, DismProv.dll, and various .mui files in the en-US subdirectory.\n\nI know that when software installs or updates, it often creates temporary files in such directories. These files might be part of a legitimate update process where old files are being cleaned up after installation. The FileCreateTime event could be adjusting timestamps as part of this process.\n\nSince all events involve Dism.exe and the files are within a temp directory, this doesn't seem suspicious at first glance. Dism.exe is part of the Windows operating system, so its activity should be monitored but not necessarily flagged unless it's doing something out of the ordinary.\n\nThere's no indication that these files were malicious in nature. They're standard DLLs and MUI files related to deployment services. The repeated deletion events might seem repetitive, but they could just be part of a cleanup process during an update or installation.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or injection into the Dism.exe process.

First off, I know that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Service Installer. It's usually associated with Windows installation and servicing operations. So, it's not unusual for it to delete files during these processes.\n\nEach event shows that a different DLL file is being deleted. The paths all point to the same temporary folder, which makes sense because Dism often works with temp directories when performing tasks like updates or installations. The naming convention of the files (like IBSProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll.mui, etc.) suggests they are language-specific resource files, possibly related to different components or features in Windows.\n\nI'm considering whether this activity is normal. Dism.exe regularly deletes temporary files as part of its operations, so seeing multiple deletions in a temp directory isn't a red flag on its own. However, the fact that all these deletions are happening in sequence and involve numerous DLLs might raise an eyebrow. But since they're all under the same process and path, it's likely part of a legitimate operation like cleaning up after an update or servicing.\n\nI should also think about alternative possibilities. Could this be part of some malicious activity? Maybe if Dism.exe was being abused by malware, but I don't have evidence here beyond these events. Since all actions are consistent with normal Dism behavior and there's no indication of other suspicious activities (like unauthorized access or unusual timing), it's probably not malicious.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple similar events doesn't necessarily mean an attack. It could just be that the system is going through a process that requires deleting several files at once. Without more context, like related events such as failed logins, network anomalies, or other suspicious logs around this time, it's hard to justify classifying these as interesting.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the same legitimate process (Dism.exe) is performing expected file deletions in a standard location.

The Windows log task is a file deletion logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. So, each event is about a file being deleted by Dism.exe.\n\nNow, looking at the files being deleted. Each path points to a different .dll file in the same temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. The files are various providers like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. \n\nI know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing and management. It's commonly used during OS installations or updates to deploy changes without restarting the system. One of its functions is to manage components, which includes adding or removing features from an operating system image.\n\nWhen you install or update software using DISM, it often creates temporary files in these directories and deletes them afterward as part of normal operations. The .dll files being deleted here are likely part of a package that was installed and then cleaned up after the process is done. \n\nSo, each event represents a file deletion by a legitimate system process during its normal operation. Since all the actions are consistent with what DISM does when managing packages or updates, there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here, like multiple failed attempts, deletions from unexpected locations, or involvement of other processes that shouldn't be accessing those files. All events seem to fit within standard operating procedures for the tool.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that this batch doesn't indicate anything suspicious and is part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries are related to legitimate file deletion activities by the Dism.exe process during normal system updates or installations. Each event details the removal of specific .dll files from a temporary directory, which is a standard procedure for DISM when managing operating system components. Since all actions align with expected behavior and there's no evidence of unauthorized access or malicious intent, this batch of logs is not indicative of suspicious activity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"not_interesting\",\n    \"reason\": \"The log entries are part of normal operations involving legitimate system processes (Dism.exe) performing file deletions as part of package management during updates or installations.\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to make sense of this data. I'm seeing a series of logs that seem to be related to processes and some file operations on a Windows system. The entries are in JSON format, but they're not valid because the keys aren't properly quoted. For example, \"process\" and \"winlog\" should have quotes around them.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process named \"svchost.exe\" with some task related to cybersecurity. I'm not entirely sure what all those terms mean together, but it seems like some kind of service or activity being monitored. Then there are other processes like \"services.exe\" and \"sppsvc.exe,\" which I think are legitimate Windows services.\n\nThere's a mention of \"Windows Update Agent\" in one log, which makes me think that this might be part of the system updating process. But then there are multiple entries where the process is PowerShell executing some commands to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo.\" The command line shows that it's setting up this service with a specific binary path and starting it.\n\nI'm concerned because creating services using PowerShell can be a common tactic in cyberattacks, like installing malware or ransomware. The repeated use of the same command might indicate an automated process trying to establish persistence on the system. Also, the path mentioned in the binary is \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe.\" That looks suspicious because it's a long and unusual path, which could be where malicious files are stored.\n\nI should check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service or not. Maybe I can look up its name online to see if others have reported it as malware. Also, the fact that there are multiple entries with the same command suggests something is running in a loop or being executed multiple times, which could be part of an infection process.\n\nI wonder if these activities are part of normal system operations or if they're signs of an intrusion. It might help to compare this activity against known patterns of malicious behavior. If I can find any indicators of compromise (IoCs) like specific file hashes or known malicious scripts, that would give a clearer picture.\n\nAnother thing is the use of Registry value sets and image loads. Legitimate software often interacts with the registry and loads DLLs, but in this context, combined with creating new services via PowerShell, it could be an attempt to make changes persistent across reboots.\n\nI think I should also look into the timestamps on these logs to see if there's a pattern or if certain activities happen around the same time. That might help identify if multiple malicious actions are coordinated.\n\nOverall, while not all of these entries might indicate something wrong, the combination of creating new services via PowerShell and accessing unusual file paths makes me cautious. It would be wise to run some antivirus scans or use tools like Process Monitor to get more detailed information about what these processes are doing.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you've provided appear to show a sequence of events on a Windows system that could indicate potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Entries:**\n   - The first log entries mention processes like `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. These are typically legitimate Windows processes.\n   - However, the presence of tasks related to cybersecurity and file operations (e.g., reading from or writing to specific files) might warrant closer inspection.\n\n2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands to create a new service named `\"objeto_ativo\"` using `New-Service` and starting it with `Start-Service`. This activity is unusual unless part of legitimate system administration.\n   - The path specified for the binary (`C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`) seems suspicious. It's a long, non-standard path which could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\n3. **Repetitive Commands:**\n   - The repeated execution of the same PowerShell command to create and start the service suggests an automated or script-based process. This is often indicative of malware attempting to establish persistence on the system.\n\n4. **Registry and Image Load Activities:**\n   - Entries involving registry value changes (`RegistryEvent`) and image loading (`ImageLoad`) could be part of legitimate operations, but in this context, they might also be signs of malicious software modifying system configurations.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious Indicators:**\n   - The combination of creating a new service via PowerShell with an unusual name and path, along with repeated attempts to do so, raises concerns about potential malware or unauthorized access.\n   - If the binary at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is unknown or unverified, it could be malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate the Binary Path:**\n   - Verify if the file at `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` is legitimate. Use antivirus software to scan this file for malware.\n\n2. **Check Service Listings:**\n   - Review the list of running services in Task Manager or using the Command Prompt (`services.msc`) to see if `\"objeto_ativo\"` exists and appears legitimate.\n\n3. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Look into how PowerShell is being used. If this activity isn't authorized, consider disabling PowerShell execution unless necessary for business operations.\n\n4. **Review Recent Updates:**\n   - Check the system's update history to ensure no unauthorized software was installed recently that could explain these activities.\n\n5. **Monitor System Activity:**\n   - Use monitoring tools like Process Monitor or Event Viewer to track unusual processes and activity patterns.\n\n6. **Conduct a Full System Scan:**\n   - Run comprehensive antivirus scans to detect any potential malware.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe observed activity, particularly the repeated use of PowerShell to create services with non-standard names and paths, suggests possible malicious intent. Immediate investigation is recommended to ensure system integrity and security."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial event shows a PowerShell command that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. That catches my attention because creating services can be a way to persist malicious activities on a system. The command line is using `New-Service` which I know is part of the PSWindowsUpdate module or similar, but regardless, creating a service that's not commonly seen could indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the next events, there are several instances where PowerShell is being run with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`. That's interesting because even though it's restricted, sometimes attackers might use this to limit script execution unless they have specific needs. The command `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` seems benign, but when combined with the previous event, I wonder if these are part of a larger script.\n\nThen there are multiple events where PowerShell is executing a more complex command involving `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item...`. This part retrieves INF files from the Windows directory and checks their content for specific patterns. If it finds something matching `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]`, it sets `$Res` to 1. This seems like a script trying to detect or interact with system drivers, which could be malicious if done without proper authorization.\n\nThe repetition of these commands across multiple events suggests automation or scheduled tasks, which is another red flag. Attackers often use such techniques to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The combination of creating a service and querying system files might indicate an attempt to install malware that hides as a legitimate service or attempts to drop further payloads based on the INF file analysis.\n\nAnother point is the log task fields: \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\". These tasks are related to Windows event logging but seeing them paired with the specific PowerShell commands makes me think it's part of some automated process, possibly for persistence.\n\nI'm also considering if these activities could be legitimate. For example, system administrators might run scripts to check driver information or manage services. However, the frequency and nature of the commands make it less likely. The initial creation of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\") is unusual and not something I'd expect from routine admin tasks.\n\nLooking at all events together, there's a pattern: one event creates a new service, then multiple events run similar checks on system files. This sequence could be part of an attack chain where the first step is establishing persistence via a service and subsequent steps are gathering information or deploying additional malware based on the system's configuration.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events show signs of potentially malicious activity involving service creation and system file analysis, which should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious PowerShell activities such as creating a new service and querying system files, indicating possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. There are five events here.\n\nFirst, let's break down each event:\n\n1. The first two events both have the same command line:\n   ```\n   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;\n   ```\n   This command is executing a PowerShell script with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted, which means it's running in a more secure context. The script seems to be checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory's inf folder. Specifically, it's looking for lines that match certain device installation sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. This could be indicative of an attempt to gather information about hardware or drivers, which might be part of a larger attack.\n\n2. The third event has no process info but mentions \"Security Group Management\" in the winlog task. This is common and usually not suspicious on its own unless there's an unusual pattern or timing with other events.\n\n3. The fourth event shows services.exe as the process name, which is a legitimate Windows process related to managing system services. There's a logon event here, which could be normal user activity or service start-ups.\n\n4. The fifth event again has no process info but mentions \"Special Logon\" in the winlog task. Special logons are typically used by system services and can indicate background activities, not necessarily malicious on their own.\n\nLooking at these events as a whole, two of them involve PowerShell executing commands that inspect INF files for specific patterns. This kind of activity is concerning because it could be part of an attack chain where the attacker is trying to gather information about the system (like hardware details) to tailor an exploit or drop malware components based on the environment.\n\nThe fact that there are two identical events suggests this might be a repeated attempt, possibly to ensure success or to avoid detection. While each event alone might not raise too many flags, together they indicate potentially malicious intent, especially considering the use of PowerShell with restricted execution policies, which is often used by attackers to execute commands stealthily.\n\nThe third and fifth events are more innocuous but don't add much to the concern. The fourth event is completely benign. However, when combined with the first two, there's a pattern that warrants attention.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the suspicious PowerShell activity involving INF file analysis, which could be a precursor to more malicious actions. My confidence level is around 0.8 because while the events are concerning, they don't definitively prove malicious intent without further context or additional logs showing other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell activity attempting to analyze system INF files for potential hardware-specific patterns, which may indicate malicious reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
