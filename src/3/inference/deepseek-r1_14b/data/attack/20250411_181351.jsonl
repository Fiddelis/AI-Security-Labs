{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's look through each event.\n\nThe first event is powershell.exe accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers but also legitimate scripts. Then there's whoami.exe being run. That's usually harmless, just checking user info.\n\nNext, more powershell.exe accesses and a svchost.exe making registry changes. SvcHost is a common process for services, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nI see multiple events where powershell.exe is setting registry values. That could indicate persistence mechanisms if done in the right context. Also, several Image Load events from PowerShell loading .NET libraries—normal behavior but sometimes attackers use this to hide malicious code.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some powershell.exe processes, they're capturing screenshots and saving them to temp files. This is a classic technique used by malware to gather visual data from the system without user interaction. The repeated calls with different filenames like 'unidade_logico.png', 'tarefa_comum.png', etc., suggest automated screenshotting, which could be part of an information gathering phase or persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances performing registry writes, loading .NET libraries, and taking screenshots in the temp directory. These behaviors are red flags for potential malicious activity. The combination is concerning because it shows a pattern that might indicate a script attempting to gather system info and set up persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious activities including registry modifications, loading .NET libraries, and taking screenshots in the temp directory suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple PowerShell processes running scripts that capture the screen and save images to the TEMP directory. These command lines look suspicious because they're using PowerShell with System.Windows.Forms to take screenshots. Such activities can be indicators of malicious behavior like screen recording or screenshoting, which might be part of an information stealing attack.\n\nNext, I notice a file creation event for \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1\" and then it's deleted right after. This pattern is concerning because creating and immediately deleting files can be tactics used by malware to bypass certain security policies or to leave less evidence behind.\n\nThere are several registry value sets from different processes, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe. While some of these might be legitimate system operations, frequent registry changes can also indicate malicious activity since attackers often modify the registry for persistence or other malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there are events related to pipe creation and process access in PowerShell, which could be a way for processes to communicate with each other. This is another red flag because attackers sometimes use pipes for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show multiple signs of potentially malicious activities: suspicious PowerShell commands, file creation\/deletion patterns, registry modifications, and pipe creations. These indicators collectively suggest a high likelihood of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including screen capture attempts, file creation and deletion, and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've been given a batch of events in JSONL format, and my task is to analyze them as a whole to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. There are multiple entries where the process name is 'chrome.exe'. The winlog field shows various tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Dns query', and 'Image loaded'. Each of these could be normal operations for a browser, especially when it's loading resources or handling configurations.\n\nI notice that most events are about registry changes. These might not be suspicious on their own because legitimate software often modifies the registry. However, if there were too many such changes in a short time, it might raise flags. But here, they seem spread out and not unusually frequent.\n\nLooking at the files involved, most have 'file' as None, which probably means no file was accessed or modified during these events. The two entries that do reference files are loading system32 files, which are standard system components. This doesn't indicate any malicious activity.\n\nConsidering the entire batch together, all events stem from a single process ('chrome.exe'), and none of the actions seem out of place for typical browser operations—loading DLLs, querying DNS, modifying registry settings. There's no evidence of unusual file accesses or network activities that would suggest malware or unauthorized access.\n\nMoreover, the repetition of similar tasks might just be Chrome performing its normal functions, especially if it's in use across different tabs or extensions. Without any anomalies like failed login attempts, unexpected file creations, or communication with known malicious domains, there's little reason to flag this batch as interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I always stay vigilant, the current data doesn't point towards any suspicious behavior. Therefore, classifying this batch as 'NOT INTERESTING' seems appropriate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal browser operations involving registry modifications and loading of system files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
