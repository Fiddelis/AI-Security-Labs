{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; I think it's part of Symantec Endpoint Protection. It might be normal for such a process to load system libraries, so maybe nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nNext, there are some events related to user account management. Those could just be standard user logon or off events, which usually aren't concerning unless they're happening at odd times or in bulk.\n\nThen, I see \"rundll32.exe\" being executed with a command line that includes shell32.dll and a GUID. Rundll32 is commonly used to run DLL functions, but the specific parameters here don't immediately raise red flags. It could be part of legitimate Windows operations, like launching some embedded application.\n\nThe \"svchost.exe\" entries are next. Svchost is a generic host process for services, so it's normal to see it interacting with registry values. Without unusual activity or known malicious indicators, this might not be concerning.\n\nThere are two events from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which I believe is part of the ELK stack used for log management. They're creating files in their data directory, which seems routine and expected behavior.\n\nEXCEL.EXE appears multiple times with various DLL loads. It's a common application, so seeing it load system libraries isn't unusual unless it's loading something unexpected or there are anomalies in how it's being used.\n\nLooking at \"RuntimeBroker.exe,\" this is typically related to Windows Runtime components, so it interacting with the registry is normal activity.\n\nThere's an entry where the process name is null and task is None. That might be a system event that doesn't correspond to any specific process, which could be standard logging noise.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process stands out a bit because WMI is often targeted by attackers for persistence or lateral movement. The command line here seems normal, but I should consider if the parameters are typical or if they indicate some hidden activity. However, without more context on what's being executed, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the events seem to cover a range of normal system activities: process creations, DLL loads, registry interactions, user logons, and file operations by legitimate applications and services like Excel, Symantec, and Windows components. There doesn't appear to be any direct evidence of malicious behavior, such as known bad processes, unexpected paths, or unusual API calls.\n\nWhile WmiPrvSE.exe could be a point of concern due to its association with potential attacks, the specific command line here doesn't show anything overtly suspicious. It's possible that this is just normal operation, especially if it's related to WMI services.\n\nGiven all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The events don't collectively indicate any malicious activity; they seem consistent with typical system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of normal system activities such as process creation, DLL loading, and registry interactions by legitimate applications like Excel, Symantec Endpoint Protection, and Windows services. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given batch of events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several events with null process and file info but a task of \"User Account Management\". That seems like normal user activity, maybe logins or group changes, so probably not suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I see events where Excel.exe is the process. The first one loads coml2.dll, which sounds legitimate since it's part of Windows System32. Next, there are DNS queries from Excel, which could be normal if it's checking for updates or connecting to servers.\n\nLooking further, there are file creation events in the Office Recent folder pointing to a .LNK file named real_values.csv.LNK. This is interesting because .LNK files are shortcut files. If this was created by Excel, maybe it's just tracking recent files, but I wonder why it ends with .LNK and not something else.\n\nThere are multiple instances of these file creations and DNS queries. Repetition could indicate normal behavior or part of a script, but the exact same path being created twice might be worth looking into. Also, Excel making multiple DNS queries could be checking for external resources, which might be normal but also possibly malicious if they're reaching known bad domains.\n\nI should consider whether these activities together indicate something suspicious. While individual events seem benign, the combination—like repeated file creations and DNS lookups from Excel—might suggest a potential issue like a macro trying to reach command-and-control servers or exfiltrating data.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious. It could just be legitimate usage of Excel with some scripts or add-ins running. But given the pattern and the file activity in the Recent folder, I'm leaning towards interesting because there might be an underlying reason for these actions that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated DNS queries and file creation activities from Excel.exe, potentially indicating suspicious behavior such as communication with external domains or tracking of user files.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
