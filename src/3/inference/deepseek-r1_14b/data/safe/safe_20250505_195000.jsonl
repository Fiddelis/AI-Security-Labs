{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\". It seems like it's loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. That's a bit repetitive but not necessarily suspicious on its own—maybe it's part of normal system operations. But since it's happening so many times, maybe I should keep an eye out for anything else related to this process.\n\nThen there are entries from \"taskhostw.exe\" loading taskschd.dll. TaskHost is a legitimate Windows process used by task scheduler, so that seems normal. No red flags here.\n\nThere's also \"services.exe\" with a logon event and a special logon event without any process info. Services.exe is part of the service control manager, so logon events are expected when services start or stop. Not sure if this is concerning yet.\n\nLooking further down, I see \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the user's Downloads folder with a specific path. Winlogbeat sounds like an agent for collecting Windows logs, maybe something like the Elastic Winlogbeat tool. If that's running and creating config files, it should be okay unless there's something malicious about its setup.\n\nThen, I spot several \"Dns query\" events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". DNS queries themselves are common, but repeated ones might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're all coming from the same process. Maybe it's checking for updates or communicating with a domain, which could be part of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also an entry for \"powershell.exe\" being created and loading various .NET DLLs, which is normal because PowerShell uses those libraries. However, there's a file creation event by powershell.exe in the user's temp folder. The filename \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1\" seems unusual. Powershell scripts related to policy testing could be legitimate, but sometimes attackers use script policy bypass techniques. This might be something to investigate.\n\nI also notice that \"svchost.exe\" and \"Explorer.EXE\" are modifying the registry. Those processes are standard for system services and explorer shell operations, so this isn't suspicious on its own unless there's a known malicious activity tied to those specific registry changes.\n\nPutting it all together: The repetitive loading of DLLs by SDXHelper.exe and multiple DNS queries might be part of legitimate operations or could be indicators of an ongoing process like checking into a command and control server. The creation of a PowerShell script in the temp folder is more concerning because it's often used in attacks for lateral movement or to execute malicious code.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these events together definitely indicate malicious activity, but there are enough red flags, especially around the PowerShell script and the repeated DNS queries, that I think this batch is worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Processes:**\n   - \"SDXHelper.exe\" frequently loads DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll). Could be legitimate or part of malicious activity.\n   - \"taskhostw.exe\" and \"services.exe\" are associated with standard system processes, so their activities don't raise alarms.\n\n2. **Check for Legitimate Tools:**\n   - \"winlogbeat.exe\" likely a log collection tool (e.g., Elastic Winlogbeat), which is usually non-malicious but should be verified against known configurations.\n\n3. **Registry and File Operations:**\n   - Registry modifications by \"svchost.exe\" and \"Explorer.EXE\" are standard, so no immediate concern.\n   - The creation of a PowerShell script in the temp folder with an unusual name (__PSScriptPolicyTest...) is suspicious, as attackers may use such scripts for policy bypass or execution.\n\n4. **Dns Query Activity:**\n   - Multiple DNS queries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" could indicate communication with external servers. While not inherently malicious, frequent queries might suggest command and control (C2) activity.\n\n5. **Powershell Activity:**\n   - Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The creation of the .ps1 file in the temp directory raises suspicion, especially if it's unexpected or unsanctioned by the user.\n\n6. **Correlation:**\n   - Combining all these points—repetitive process activity, suspicious file creation, and DNS queries—suggests potential malicious behavior that merits further investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The batch contains activities that could be legitimate but also show signs of possible malicious intent, particularly around PowerShell usage and DNS queries. Therefore, it's deemed interesting for further analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"isInteresting\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"repetitiveProcessActivity\": {\n      \"processName\": \"SDXHelper.exe\",\n      \"description\": \"Frequent loading of DLLs which could be part of legitimate operations or potential malicious activity.\"\n    },\n    \"dnsQueryConcerns\": {\n      \"source\": \"SDXHelper.exe\",\n      \"description\": \"Multiple DNS queries that may indicate communication with external servers, potentially malicious.\"\n    },\n    \"powershellScriptCreation\": {\n      \"filePath\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1\",\n      \"description\": \"Unusual script creation in the temp folder, possibly related to malicious activity.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is a File Delete logged from powershell.exe. That stands out because deleting files can be malicious, but I should check the file path. The file being deleted is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1. It looks like a temporary PowerShell script, which might be normal if it's part of a test or setup process.\n\nThe next few events are about Pipe Created and Provider Lifecycle tasks from powershell.exe. These seem routine for PowerShell when it starts up or interacts with other processes. Not too suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's an Image loaded task where powershell.exe loads MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That makes sense because Defender might interact with PowerShell for some security-related tasks.\n\nThere are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events from powershell.exe. These are typical when a script or process initializes in PowerShell. Since they're repeated, it's possible that the same script is running through several steps.\n\nLooking further down, there's an Image loaded event where HxTsr.exe sets a registry value. I'm not familiar with HxTsr.exe; maybe it's part of some legitimate software, but without more context, this could be worth looking into.\n\nThen there are events involving py.exe and python.exe. These seem to be Python-related processes starting up. The command lines show paths pointing to Python installations, which is normal if the user is running scripts or using Python applications. However, I notice that both py.exe and python.exe are involved multiple times, but without seeing any unusual file operations or network activities, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nPutting all these together: there's a lot of activity from PowerShell, which can be common for both legitimate use and attacks. The deletion of a temporary script might indicate something was cleaned up, but it could also be part of normal scripting processes. The presence of multiple events from the same process (powershell.exe) over time suggests some script is running through several steps, possibly including downloading or executing other files.\n\nI should consider whether these events collectively indicate malicious behavior. The File Delete event on its own might raise an eyebrow, but combined with all the PowerShell activity and the Python processes, it's a bit concerning. However, without evidence of known malicious indicators like network traffic, dropped files elsewhere, or unusual registry changes beyond what's shown (like HxTsr.exe), I'm not entirely sure.\n\nSo, is this batch INTERESTING or NOT? The File Delete and multiple PowerShell events make me lean towards it being interesting because there could be hidden malicious activity. But without more data points, the confidence isn't very high.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file deletion and image loads, along with Python process creations, suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events are both from \"python.exe\". They have the same task of Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad). The file paths are pointing to DLLs in a Python directory. So this seems normal, like Python loading its libraries.\n\nNext, there's an event from winlogbeat.exe about creating a file at \".winlogbeat.yml.new\" under the downloads folder. Since winlogbeat is an ELK tool used for log shipping, it makes sense that it's creating configuration files. This is expected behavior.\n\nThen I see three events from SDXHelper.exe making DNS queries. The process name SDXHelper is a bit unusual; I'm not immediately familiar with it. Maybe it's legitimate or could be something else. But the fact that there are multiple instances of it querying DNS might be worth looking into, as repeated DNS lookups can sometimes indicate malicious activity like C2 (command and control) communication.\n\nThe last event is from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. Runtime Broker is part of Windows related to User Account Control and package isolation in Windows Store apps. It's common for it to make registry changes, so this seems normal unless there's something unusual about the specific key or value being set.\n\nPutting it all together: Most events look benign—normal process loads, expected log file creation by winlogbeat, and standard RuntimeBroker activity. However, the multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper.exe stand out. While it could be legitimate (maybe checking updates or something), without more context, there's a slight concern about potential malicious behavior. The confidence is medium because while some events are suspicious, they might also have legitimate causes.\n\nSo overall, the batch is interesting due to the repeated DNS queries but not significantly so that it demands immediate attention.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The presence of multiple DNS query events from SDXHelper.exe raises suspicion as it could indicate potential malicious activity. While some events are normal, others may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
