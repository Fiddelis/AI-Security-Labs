{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a batch of JSONL events and asked me to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each event represents. Looking at the events, most are related to processes loading images or files, some file creations, network connections, and process accesses. For example, there are multiple entries where \"MpCmdRun.exe\" loads certain DLLs. This seems normal because MpCmdRun.exe is part of Windows Defender, so it's expected behavior.\n\nI should check for any signs of malicious activity. Are there any unusual processes or file paths? The events include Discord.exe and OneDriveLauncher.exe, which are legitimate applications. There's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe, likely from the Elastic Beat, used for log management, so that's benign too.\n\nLooking closer, I don't see any red flags like unfamiliar process names, suspicious file paths, or repeated failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks. The events seem to be standard operations: loading DLLs, creating files, accessing network resources, and process monitoring.\n\nHowever, there are two empty events where both process and file info are null. That's a bit odd but not necessarily malicious; it could be an error or incomplete logging.\n\nConsidering all events together, the activities don't collectively point to any suspicious behavior. They look like normal system operations with no anomalies that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of standard system processes and activities such as file creations, image loads, and network connections, which are typical for a running system.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries where the process name is \"Discord.exe\". That makes sense because Discord is a common application, and its processes might generate many logs. Looking at the tasks, there are several \"Pipe Created\" events, which are related to inter-process communication. These could be normal operations for Discord as it runs.\n\nThen, I notice some entries where the process name changes. For example, there's \"reg.exe\" being used with command lines that query and modify the Windows Registry under HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run. This is interesting because modifying the Run key can indicate persistence mechanisms. The first use of reg.exe is just querying, but in another event, it adds a value to set the Discord executable path. This could be part of a legitimate update process or potentially something malicious trying to establish persistence.\n\nNext, there are several \"Registry value set\" events by reg.exe, which further suggests that something is modifying the system's configuration. This could be an attempt to ensure Discord runs on startup automatically, which isn't inherently suspicious but might warrant closer look if combined with other behaviors.\n\nI also see multiple \"Network connection detected\" events from Discord.exe. While Discord does require internet connections for its services, a high number of these logs could indicate unusual activity, such as the application connecting to unexpected servers or excessive data transfer, which might be signs of malicious behavior like exfiltration.\n\nAdditionally, there are \"Process Create\" and \"Process accessed\" events related to both reg.exe and Discord.exe. These could be normal operations, but combined with the registry modifications, they raise some flags about potential unauthorized changes to system settings.\n\nLooking at the file-related logs, most entries don't have a file path, so I can't assess file accesses or writes directly. However, one entry mentions \"winlogbeat.yml.new\", which is related to the ELK stack's winlogbeat tool. This might be unrelated unless there's an attempt to manipulate logging mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination of registry modifications and network connections could indicate a potential threat. The use of reg.exe to modify startup settings is concerning because it can allow malicious actors to persist across reboots. Additionally, multiple network connections from Discord.exe might suggest data being sent out without user knowledge.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these activities are part of Discord's normal operation or something else, especially since I don't have the exact context of how Discord behaves in logs. However, the volume and nature of these events do seem unusual enough to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications and network connections from Discord.exe, which could indicate malicious activity or unauthorized persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me see what each event is about. Most of them are from \"Discord.exe\". There's a lot of network connection detections and DNS queries. Also, there are some file creations and image loads related to Discord modules.\n\nHmm, so first, Discord is a common application, so it's not unusual for it to have many processes and network activities. The events like NetworkConnect, DnsQuery, FileCreate, and ImageLoad are standard operations for any running app, especially one that uses the internet as much as Discord does.\n\nLooking at the command line in one of the Process Create events, it's pretty typical for Discord to disable GPU sandboxing and specify user data directories. No red flags there.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activities like file deletions, unauthorized access attempts, or unusual process creations outside of Discord. The files being created are all within the expected Discord module paths. There's also a reference to urlmon.dll loaded by SDXHelper.exe, but that's a standard Windows system file used for URL parsing.\n\nSince all these events fit typical behavior for Discord, I don't see any reason to flag this batch as interesting. The confidence is high because there's nothing out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations of the Discord application, including network connections, DNS queries, file creations, and process activities, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from the system logs. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they merit investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that almost every entry has \"Discord.exe\" as the process name. That immediately makes me think it's related to Discord activity on a Windows machine. Now, considering that Discord is a popular chat application, many of its processes are normal and expected. But I need to look deeper into what each event is indicating.\n\nLet's go through some key events:\n\n1. **Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)**: This happens multiple times with different DLLs like vk_swiftshader.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and various .node files in the modules folder. These seem to be standard library loads for Discord. The paths look legitimate, pointing to where Discord is installed.\n\n2. **Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)**: There are several of these events. This typically means another process or part of the system is accessing Discord.exe. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious, but given that Discord can have multiple components and might interact with other processes, it's not inherently malicious.\n\n3. **Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)**: Only one event here. It could be setting some configuration or preferences for the Discord client. Again, normal for an application to interact with system settings.\n\n4. **Network connection detected (rule: NetworkConnect)**: This occurs several times. Since Discord is a communication app that connects over the internet, these network connections are expected. Unless they're connecting to unusual IPs or in unexpected patterns, it's not concerning here.\n\n5. **File creation time changed (rule: FileCreateTime)**: Two events here, both temporary files in the Discord user data directory. Temporary files are common for applications saving state or data during runtime, so this is normal behavior.\n\n6. **File created (.winlogbeat.yml.new)**: This seems to be from winlogbeat.exe, which is likely a log management tool. It's creating a new config file, which isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nAlso, towards the end, there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events without any associated files. But since it's all related to Discord, I don't see an immediate red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: All these events relate to normal operations of the Discord application—loading libraries, accessing processes, registry interactions, network connections, and file handling. There’s no indication of unusual behavior such as access to restricted areas, multiple failed attempts, or connections to known malicious domains. The frequency and types of these events align with typical user activity when running Discord.\n\nI don't see any signs of intrusion or malicious activities here. It seems like a regular day for the Discord application on this system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Discord.exe operations, including loading DLLs, accessing processes, registry interactions, network connections, and file handling. No signs of malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by understanding what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, there are some initial entries about processes like smartscreen.exe and taskhostw.exe loading images. These seem normal since they’re part of Windows system operations. The ImageLoad rule triggers when these files are loaded into memory, which isn't unusual.\n\nThen I notice a lot of events from Discord.exe. It's accessing processes multiple times, which could be related to its legitimate operation. However, the key point here is that Discord is modifying file creation times and making numerous network connections. \n\nThe file creation time change on a temporary file might indicate something malicious, like an attempt to cover tracks by altering timestamps. But more concerning is the excessive network connections. While Discord does require some network activity for its operation, 25 events in one batch of network connection detections could signal an issue. This could be part of data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which might not be standard behavior.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of these events being indicators of a potential breach. The combination of file modifications and excessive network traffic is a red flag. It's possible that Discord.exe has been compromised and is acting as a vector for malicious activities.\n\nWhile I can't be 100% certain without more context, the volume of network connections stands out enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances where Discord.exe is accessing files and making numerous network connections, which may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each log step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is Discord.exe and the event is \"Network connection detected\". Since Discord is a legitimate application that often connects to servers, these might not be suspicious on their own unless there's unusual frequency or destination. But seeing this repeated so many times makes me think—could it be too much? Maybe, but without more context, I'm not sure.\n\nThen there are some logs from winlogbeat.exe about file creation in a specific path. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect these logs, so its activity is normal and probably not concerning unless it's accessing unusual files.\n\nNext, sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll seems standard since those are part of Windows system processes. No red flags there.\n\nAn entry from svchost.exe modifying a registry value could be suspicious because svchost is often used by malware to hide its activities. However, svchost can also be part of legitimate services, so without knowing the exact sub-process or activity, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are several \"Process accessed\" events from Discord.exe. Processes accessing each other isn't unusual, especially in applications that handle multiple components or plugins. But again, without context on what they're accessing, it's tricky.\n\nThe file creation time changes for files related to Discord's cache and network might be normal if Discord is updating or reorganizing its data. However, frequent changes could indicate something more malicious like file tampering.\n\nPutting it all together: Most logs are from a legitimate application (Discord) performing standard operations, with some system processes doing their thing. The only potentially concerning points are the svchost.exe registry activity and multiple network connections from Discord. But without additional context or anomalies beyond frequency, these might just be normal behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate processes like Discord.exe performing normal operations, including network connections and file handling. While some activities like svchost.exe modifying registry values could warrant attention, there is insufficient evidence of malicious behavior in the provided logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}\n```"}
