So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows command, so that's normal. Then there's 'powershell.exe' being accessed a few times. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the third event, there's a PowerShell command that creates a new service named 'objeto_ativo' with a binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe'. That seems odd because creating a new service isn't typical for a regular user process. Also, the path 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe' doesn't look standard. Usually, legitimate services are in system directories, not in paths like 'unidade_logico'.\n\nNext, there are multiple image loads from PowerShell, including 'mscoree.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. 'mscoree.dll' is part of the .NET runtime, which might be normal if .NET is involved, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious. 'MpOAV.dll' is related to Windows Defender, so loading that might be unusual unless it's part of a legitimate Defender operation. However, since it's being loaded by PowerShell, that's a bit concerning.\n\nThen there's a file created and immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute and then clean up traces. The file name '__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1' might be a script that was run temporarily. The creation and deletion could indicate an attempt to hide activity.\n\nThe 'tarefa_logico.exe' is loading 'clr.dll' and 'clrjit.dll', which are part of the .NET Common Language Runtime. If this executable is not a standard .NET application, that might be a sign of something malicious, especially since it's being run as a service.\n\nThere are also multiple registry value sets by 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe', which could indicate changes to service configurations or other system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThe 'setup.exe' events are creating files related to Microsoft Edge, like 'msedge_proxy.exe' and 'pwahelper.exe'. These might be part of a legitimate Edge installation or update, but if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of a rogue installation or a dropper.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the creation of a new service with a non-standard executable, the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious scripting, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the loading of unusual DLLs. These activities, especially when combined, suggest possible malicious behavior, such as an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code on the system. However, some events could be legitimate, so the confidence isn't 100%, but it's high enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands create and execute a custom service (objeto_ativo) with a non-standard binary path (tarefa_logico.exe), followed by suspicious file creation\/deletion in Temp directory and unusual DLL loading patterns.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files mentioned are show_third_party_software_licenses.bat, Installer\\setup.exe, and msedge.exe. Wait, msedge.exe is a legitimate Microsoft Edge component, but the fact that setup.exe is creating it might be suspicious. However, maybe it's part of a normal installation process.\n\nThen there are several entries with svchost.exe and services.exe modifying the registry. svchost.exe is a normal system process, but if it's making a lot of registry changes, that could be a red flag. However, svchost.exe is known to host various system services, so some registry changes might be normal. But the repetition here might indicate something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple FileCreate events under C:\\Windows\\Temp with APPX temporary files. These are typically created during Windows updates or app installations. However, the presence of multiple such files could be part of a legitimate process or might be used by malware to store temporary data. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe command that runs with Restricted execution policy and writes a message. The command itself seems benign, but the use of PowerShell can sometimes be abused by attackers. However, the command here is simple and doesn't show any malicious activity.\n\nNow, considering all the events together: setup.exe is creating files in Microsoft directories, which might be part of an installation. However, the same setup.exe is also modifying the registry. The svchost.exe instances creating temp files might be part of system updates. But the combination of setup.exe creating both legitimate and possibly suspicious files, along with registry changes, might indicate an attempt to install or modify software. However, without evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual processes, or known malicious files, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nWait, but the files created by setup.exe include msedge.exe and pwahelper.exe, which are legitimate, but the fact that setup.exe is creating them might be part of a normal installation. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and the setup.exe process might be part of a larger installation or update. However, the fact that svchost.exe is creating temp files in Windows\\Temp could be normal, but the large number of entries might suggest something is going on.\n\nAlternatively, if setup.exe is being used to install something that's not supposed to be there, but the logs don't show any obvious signs of compromise. The PowerShell command is harmless here. So, maybe this is just a normal system update or installation. But the classification needs to be based on whether there's enough to warrant investigation.\n\nThe key point here is that setup.exe is creating files in Microsoft directories, which might be part of a legitimate process, but the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations by setup.exe and svchost.exe could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence level would be moderate. Maybe the justification is that multiple file creations and registry changes by setup.exe and svchost.exe could indicate an installation or malicious activity, but not enough to be certain. So the classification would be INTERESTING, with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'setup.exe' processes created files in Microsoft Edge directories and modified the registry, which may indicate an installation or potential tampering. svchost.exe also generated numerous temporary files in system directories, which could be part of legitimate updates but warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes it's used for malicious purposes. Let me check the tasks. There are several Image loaded events pointing to .dll files. Some of these are legitimate, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be normal for PowerShell's operations.\n\nThen there's a File created event for a .psm1 file in the Temp directory. That's a PowerShell module file. Creating such files in Temp could be part of a script's normal operation, but sometimes attackers use Temp directories to store malicious scripts. However, just creating a file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nAnother event is the execution of a PowerShell command that checks INF files for certain patterns. The command is looking for defaultinstall sections in INF files, which might be related to installing drivers or system features. The command line seems legitimate, but the fact that it's being run by PowerShell could be something to note.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process running a Dism command to disable Windows Defender. Disabling security features like Defender is a red flag. That's a clear indication of potentially malicious activity because attackers often disable security software to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, Dism.exe is involved with executable files in the Temp directory. The AssocProvider.dll and DismCorePS.dll are being detected as executable. While Dism is a legitimate tool, the use of Temp directories for executables might be suspicious. However, Dism can sometimes use temporary files during operations, so it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: the most significant event is the attempt to disable Windows Defender using Dism. That's a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even though some other events are normal PowerShell activities, the disabling of a security feature is a clear sign that this batch should be investigated further. The confidence is high because disabling security software is a common tactic in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a command to disable Windows Defender using Dism.exe, which is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity aimed at compromising system security.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The first event shows a file creation in the Temp directory, specifically DismHost.exe. Then, there are multiple entries about executable files being detected, all under the same Temp folder.\n\nHmm, Dism.exe is known to use temporary files during its operations, especially when dealing with Windows images. The files mentioned here, like DismProv.dll and various .mui files, are typically part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment tools. The presence of multiple .mui files suggests language-specific resources, which is normal for Windows components.\n\nWait, but why are there so many executable files being detected here? Normally, Dism might create some temporary files, but the fact that several are marked as executable might be a red flag. However, considering the context of Dism's functionality, it's possible that these are legitimate files used during the process. The path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. \n\nBut I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The user's name here is \"fiddelis,\" but that's just a username and doesn't indicate anything. The UUID in the path (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) is a unique identifier, which is typical for temporary directories created by processes. \n\nHowever, the repeated detection of executable files might be normal for Dism's operation. I don't see any signs of unusual behavior like unexpected network activity, unauthorized access, or other suspicious processes. The logs only mention file creation and detection, which are part of Dism's normal functioning when handling image files or updates. \n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of a legitimate Dism process. The files created are in the expected location and are associated with the tool's typical operations. There's no evidence of malware or unauthorized activity here. Therefore, this might not be a security threat but just a normal system process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate activity related to the **Windows Deployment Imaging and Management (DISM)** tool, which is a legitimate system utility used for managing Windows images, updates, and deployment. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process and Files**:\n   - All events involve the **`Dism.exe`** process, which is a trusted Windows component.\n   - Files created (e.g., `DismHost.exe`, `DismProv.dll`, and `.mui` files) are associated with DISM's functionality, including language resources (`.mui` files) and temporary executables during imaging operations.\n\n2. **File Paths**:\n   - Files are created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Temp`** directory, which is a standard location for temporary files generated by system tools and applications.\n\n3. **UUID in Path**:\n   - The folder name `33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89` contains a **UUID**, which is typical for temporary directories created by system processes to isolate session-specific data.\n\n4. **No Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No signs of **unusual network activity, unauthorized access, or non-standard processes** are present.\n   - The files are not flagged as malicious, and their presence aligns with DISM's expected behavior during tasks like image deployment or update operations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThese events are **likely legitimate** and part of a **normal DISM operation** (e.g., deploying a Windows image, applying updates, or managing system components). The creation of temporary executable files in the `Temp` directory is consistent with DISM's design and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**Classification**: **Benign \/ Legitimate System Activity**.  \n**No action required** unless correlated with other suspicious logs (e.g., unexpected network connections, unauthorized user activity, etc.)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the events.\n\nFirst, all the events involve the Dism.exe and DismHost.exe processes. The winlog entries mention \"File Executable Detected\" and \"Process Create\" and \"Image loaded\" tasks. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. The filenames include things like TransmogProvider.dll, VhdProvider.dll, etc. \n\nHmm, Dism.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, which is used for Windows image deployment. It's normal for Dism to handle various DLLs during system imaging or deployment tasks. However, the fact that multiple DLLs are being detected as executables in the Temp folder might be suspicious. Typically, these DLLs are part of the Windows setup, but if they're being loaded from a temporary directory, maybe that's not standard.\n\nWait, looking at the DismHost.exe entry, the command line includes a GUID and a path to DismHost.exe in the Temp folder. That might be part of a legitimate process, but the presence of so many DLLs being loaded from the same Temp directory could indicate something. Also, the ImageLoad events for DismHost.exe and DismCorePS.dll are part of normal operations, but if these files are not signed or if they're from an unexpected source, that's a red flag.\n\nBut in this case, all the files are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. However, the sheer number of DLLs being loaded and the fact that they're all part of the same GUID folder might be part of a legitimate system image deployment. However, without more context, like the system's state or user actions, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut the key point here is that the log entries are all related to Dism and DismHost, which are legitimate tools. The events described could be part of a normal system process, such as applying updates or deploying an image. However, if this is happening unexpectedly or without user initiation, it might be a sign of something else. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any additional context, like if the system is being imaged, or if these logs are part of a normal operation, I have to go based on the logs alone. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events and ProcessCreate might be normal for Dism's operations. However, the fact that all these files are in the Temp directory might be a point of concern. Typically, during deployment, these files are part of the setup process, but if this is occurring on a regular system without any imaging activity, that could be suspicious.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the user is just running a standard deployment task. Without more information, it's hard to say. However, the fact that all these events are related to Dism and DismHost, which are known tools, might mean that this is a legitimate process. However, the logs might be interesting if there's a lack of typical indicators of compromise, but the presence of so many DLLs being loaded could be a sign of a malicious payload if not expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is undergoing a Windows image deployment, which is a legitimate scenario. So, the logs might not be suspicious. However, the assistant's job is to determine if the logs are interesting for investigation. Since the logs show a series of events that could be part of a normal process, but also could be part of something malicious if not expected, the answer might be that it's not necessarily suspicious, but could be if in an unexpected context. However, the user's instructions say to assume the logs are from a system under investigation, and the assistant is to determine if they are interesting.\n\nIn that case, the presence of these logs might be normal, but the fact that they are all related to Dism and DismHost, which are not typically used in normal user operations, might be a point of interest. However, if the system is a server or a machine being imaged, it's normal. But without context, the logs could be part of a legitimate process. Therefore, maybe the answer is that the logs are not particularly suspicious, but the assistant should note that they are related to system deployment tools and might be normal in certain contexts.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries are related to the **Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)**, which is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing and deploying Windows images. The events involve the `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` processes, along with multiple `.dll` files being loaded from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Tools:**  \n   - `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` are standard Windows tools used for tasks like applying updates, capturing\/apply Windows images, and managing system components.  \n   - The `.dll` files (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) are typically associated with DISM operations, such as during system imaging or deployment.\n\n2. **Temporary Directory Usage:**  \n   - Files are stored in the `%TEMP%` directory (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), which is a common location for temporary files during system operations. This is not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Event Types:**  \n   - **File Executable Detected:** Likely part of DISM's normal operation when loading components.  \n   - **Process Create \/ Image Load:** These are standard events during the execution of DISM-related tasks.  \n\n4. **Contextual Considerations:**  \n   - If this occurs on a system undergoing **Windows deployment, imaging, or update operations**, these logs are **expected and benign**.  \n   - If the system is **not** in the middle of such tasks (e.g., a regular user machine without imaging activity), the presence of these logs could indicate **anomalous behavior** (e.g., unauthorized deployment activities or malware masquerading as DISM).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Not Suspicious in Context of Deployment:** If the system is being imaged or deployed (e.g., a new machine setup, sysprep, or Windows Update), these logs are **normal**.  \n- **Potentially Interesting Otherwise:** If the system is not in a deployment context, the logs may warrant further investigation to confirm whether the activity is legitimate or indicative of a compromise (e.g., malware leveraging DISM tools).  \n\n**Final Verdict:**  \nThe logs are **not inherently suspicious** but are **strongly tied to DISM operations**. Their significance depends on the system's context (e.g., whether imaging\/deployment is actively occurring). If the system is not expected to perform such tasks, further analysis is recommended."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files from the Temp directory. That's a red flag because normally, system processes like DismHost shouldn't be loading a bunch of different DLLs from temporary folders. The fact that there are so many different providers (LogProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, etc.) being loaded might indicate something malicious, like a dropper or a loader trying to execute code from temporary files.\n\nThen, there are entries where Dism.exe is deleting those same files. But wait, why would Dism.exe be deleting them? If the files were just loaded and then deleted, that could be part of a technique to avoid leaving traces. Also, the deletion of both the DLLs and their MUI files (which are language-specific resources) suggests that the process is trying to clean up after itself. \n\nBut here's a thought: DismHost.exe and Dism.exe are legitimate tools used for deployment and imaging. However, their normal operations usually don't involve loading a large number of arbitrary DLLs from the Temp folder. The combination of loading multiple DLLs followed by their deletion might be indicative of a compromised system where an attacker is using these legitimate processes to execute malicious code. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a legitimate scenario where this could happen. For example, during a software installation or system update, but even then, the number of DLLs loaded here seems excessive. Also, the presence of \"ProvProvider.dll\" and \"TransmogProvider.dll\" might not be standard. \n\nThe confidence here is moderately high because the behavior is suspicious but not definitively malicious. It's not a clear-cut case, but the pattern of loading and deleting multiple DLLs from Temp is concerning. I'd lean towards marking this as suspicious and warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate a suspicious pattern of activity involving `DismHost.exe` and `Dism.exe` that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual DLL Loading by `DismHost.exe`:**\n   - `DismHost.exe` loads **10+ unique DLLs** (e.g., `LogProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`) from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). \n   - This is highly unusual for `DismHost.exe`, a legitimate tool used for Windows deployment. Legitimate operations typically involve fewer, well-known DLLs, not a large number of obscure or custom-named ones.\n\n2. **Deletion of Files by `Dism.exe`:**\n   - `Dism.exe` deletes the same DLLs and their associated `.mui` (language-specific resource) files immediately after they are loaded.\n   - This **cleanup behavior** is suspicious, as it could indicate an attempt to **avoid detection** by removing evidence of the loaded files.\n\n3. **Possible Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - **DLL Side-Loading:** The use of a temporary directory to host DLLs suggests a potential **side-loading attack**, where malicious code is injected into a legitimate process by replacing or manipulating DLLs.\n   - **Self-Cleaning Behavior:** The deletion of files post-execution is a common tactic used by malware to evade forensic analysis.\n\n4. **Legitimacy Check:**\n   - While `Dism` and `DismHost` are legitimate tools, their behavior here is **outside normal operational parameters**. Legitimate use cases would not involve loading and deleting arbitrary DLLs from the Temp directory in such a volume.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **highly suspicious** and likely **malicious**. The combination of:\n- **Unusual DLL loading** from a temporary directory,\n- **Immediate deletion** of those files,\n- **Lack of clear legitimate purpose**, \n\nstrongly suggests **compromise** or **malicious use** of the `Dism`\/`DismHost` process. Further investigation (e.g., memory analysis, checking for persistence mechanisms, network activity) is recommended to confirm the threat.\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **High suspicion** (but not definitive) due to the anomalous behavior. The pattern aligns with **malware evasion techniques** rather than legitimate system activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process deleting files. The files being deleted are all in the Temp directory under a specific UUID path, and they have names like DismProv.dll.mui, FfuProvider.dll.mui, etc. \n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment. However, it's also sometimes used by malware for various purposes. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from the Temp folder might be normal if Dism is part of a system cleanup or imaging process. But the key here is the number of files and their nature.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all have the same UUID in the path, which suggests they might be part of a temporary setup or installation. The .mui files are language-specific resource files, which are common in Windows. However, the deletion of multiple .dll.mui files could be a sign of something suspicious if they're being removed after being used, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking whether this batch is interesting for investigation. The main question is whether these deletions are benign or malicious. Since all events are from Dism.exe, which is a legitimate process, but the deletion of many files might be part of a normal operation. However, if this is happening in an unusual context, like during a system that's not being imaged, it could be a red flag. \n\nBut the justification here is that the deletions are all from a temporary directory, which is common for temporary files. Also, the fact that they're all related to Dism.exe might be part of a legitimate system process. However, the high number of deletions might be a bit concerning. But without additional context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, the user said to consider the combination of all events. All the events are the same process deleting files in the same directory. The UUID in the path is a unique identifier, which might be part of a specific installation or setup. If this is part of a normal system update or imaging, then it's okay. But if it's happening on a system that's not supposed to be imaged, then it might be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut the fact that all these deletions are from the same process and same directory might be normal. So, maybe this isn't suspicious. However, the answer might depend on knowing that Dism.exe is often used by malware. But if the system is in a state where imaging is happening, then it's normal. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, these deletions could be part of a legitimate process. However, the high number of deletions might still be worth investigating. But the answer here is probably that it's not interesting because it's a normal operation. But I need to be careful here. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of multiple .dll.mui files being deleted by Dism.exe could be part of a legitimate cleanup. However, if the system is not being imaged, then it's unusual. But since the user hasn't provided other context, the safest bet is to say that these events are likely benign, as Dism.exe is a legitimate tool. Therefore, the classification would be not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **`Dism.exe`** process deleting multiple `.dll.mui` files from a temporary directory (`%Temp%\\{UUID}\\...`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Process**:  \n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment, imaging, and system configuration. It is commonly involved in tasks like Windows Setup, sysprep, or deployment scenarios.\n\n2. **File Context**:  \n   - The files being deleted (e.g., `DismProv.dll.mui`, `FfuProvider.dll.mui`) are **language-specific resource files** (`.mui` files) associated with Windows components. These are normal in imaging or deployment contexts.\n\n3. **Temporary Directory**:  \n   - All files are located in a temporary directory (`%Temp%\\{UUID}\\...`), which aligns with typical behavior during system imaging, cleanup, or temporary setup operations.\n\n4. **No Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - There is no evidence of anomalous behavior (e.g., unexpected process names, network activity, or persistence mechanisms). The deletions are confined to temporary files.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events are **likely benign** and part of a **legitimate system operation** (e.g., imaging, sysprep, or deployment). The deletion of temporary `.mui` files by `Dism.exe` is consistent with its intended use. **No further investigation** is warranted unless additional suspicious activities are observed (e.g., unexpected execution of `Dism.exe` in non-deployment contexts, lateral movement, or persistence). \n\n**Classification**: **Not Interesting for Investigation** (Benign)."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided some JSON logs that look like they're from a Windows event, possibly related to process creation. The main entries are about a PowerShell command that creates and starts a service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". There are also some other entries with \"None\" values, which might be placeholder or incomplete data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The PowerShell command is using New-Service and Start-Service. That's a common way to create a new Windows service and then start it. The service is named \"objeto_ativo\" and the binary path is a specific executable. The user might be concerned about this because creating a new service could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if the executable isn't known or if it's being created in an unusual location.\n\nLooking at the file paths, \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" seems a bit generic. The folder names like \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro_comum\" might be part of a legitimate application, but without more context, it's hard to say. The executable name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which could be part of a legitimate software, but again, it's not immediately obvious.\n\nThe logs also have entries where \"process\" is \"None\" and \"winlog\" is \"{'task': 'None'}\". Those might be errors or incomplete logs, so maybe the system didn't capture the process details properly. However, the repeated entries with the PowerShell command are more concerning.\n\nI should check if creating a service via PowerShell is a typical action. In some cases, attackers use PowerShell to create services to maintain persistence on a system. The fact that the service is started immediately after creation could be a red flag. Also, the binary path is in a non-standard directory, which might indicate that this isn't a standard service.\n\nAnother point is the use of the & { ... } syntax in PowerShell, which is used to execute a script block. This is a common technique for running commands that might otherwise be blocked by certain security measures. The presence of both New-Service and Start-Service in the same command could be an attempt to quickly set up and activate the service without user interaction.\n\nI should also consider the context of the logs. Are these from a monitored system? If so, the creation of a new service might be flagged by security software. However, if this is part of a legitimate application's installation process, then it's normal. Without more information about the environment, it's hard to determine, but the user might be looking for signs of potential malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the creation of a new service with a non-standard path, the use of PowerShell for this action, and the immediate starting of the service. These could be indicators of an attack, but more context is needed to confirm. The user might need to check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file and if the service creation is part of a known installation process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a **Windows service creation event** via PowerShell, which could be either legitimate or suspicious depending on context. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Command Execution**\n- **Command Line**:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" ; Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n  ```\n  - **Action**: Creates a new service named `objeto_ativo` with the executable `tarefa_logico.exe` and immediately starts it.\n  - **Implications**:\n    - **Persistence**: Creating a service is a common method for attackers to maintain persistence on a system.\n    - **Non-Standard Path**: The binary path (`C:\\unidade_logico\\...`) is not a typical Windows directory. Legitimate services often reside in `C:\\Program Files` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n    - **Immediate Activation**: The service is started immediately after creation, which may indicate an attempt to execute the payload without user interaction.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Service Details**\n- **Service Name**: `objeto_ativo` (Portuguese for \"active object\").\n- **Binary Path**: `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` (Portuguese for \"logical task\").\n  - **Analysis**:\n    - The folder structure (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`) and executable name (`tarefa_logico.exe`) are generic and could belong to a legitimate application, but they are not standard for Windows services.\n    - **Risk**: If `tarefa_logico.exe` is not a known, signed, or whitelisted application, this could indicate a malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Log Anomalies**\n- **Incomplete Logs**:\n  - Entries with `\"process\": \"None\"` and `\"winlog\": {\"task\": \"None\"}` may indicate:\n    - Incomplete or malformed event logs.\n    - A lack of process details (e.g., no process ID, parent process, or user context).\n    - Potential tampering or logging issues.\n  - **Action**: Investigate the source of these logs to ensure they are not artifacts of a failed logging mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Threat Indicators**\n- **Unusual Service Creation**: Creating a service via PowerShell is not inherently malicious, but it is **uncommon** in many environments unless part of an automated deployment.\n- **Lack of Context**: Without additional details (e.g., user context, source of the executable, or correlation with other events), it is difficult to determine if this is malicious.\n- **Signature Check**: Verify if `tarefa_logico.exe` is signed by a trusted publisher and whether its hash matches known benign files.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Executable**:\n   - Check the file's **digital signature**, **hash**, and **behavior** using tools like [VirusTotal](https:\/\/www.virustotal.com\/), [MalwareBazaar](https:\/\/mbdb.abuse.ch\/), or a sandbox.\n   - Confirm if `tarefa_logico.exe` is part of a legitimate application (e.g., check the directory's ownership and modification time).\n\n2. **Investigate the Service**:\n   - Use `sc qc objeto_ativo` in PowerShell to check the service's configuration.\n   - Monitor the service's network activity, registry changes, and file system access.\n\n3. **Check for Privilege Escalation**:\n   - Determine if the command was executed with **administrative privileges**, as this is often required to create services.\n\n4. **Review Logs for Correlation**:\n   - Look for other events (e.g., process creation, network connections) around the time of the service creation to identify potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **Update Security Policies**:\n   - Restrict PowerShell use via Group Policy or Application Control (e.g., Windows Defender Application Control) if untrusted scripts are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\nWhile the service creation itself is not necessarily malicious, the **non-standard path**, **immediate activation**, and **lack of context** raise red flags. This event warrants further investigation to determine whether it is part of a legitimate process or a potential security incident. If `tarefa_logico.exe` is untrusted, it could be a **backdoor** or **malware** component."}

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first two entries, there's a PowerShell command that's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it. The binary path points to a file named tarefa_logico.exe in a directory that seems a bit non-standard: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\. Normally, system services might be in more typical locations like C:\\Program Files or something similar. The fact that a new service is being created and immediately started with a custom executable could be a red flag. That's something attackers might do to install malware persistently.\n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell is running with the ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is the default setting. But the commands here are simple, like Write-Host 'Final result: 1'. Those don't seem malicious on their own. However, the repetition of these commands might be part of a larger script or a test. But they don't immediately look harmful.\n\nAnother entry has a more complex PowerShell command that's scanning INF files in the Windows directory for specific patterns. The command is checking for sections like [defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)], which might be related to driver installations. This could be part of a legitimate system check, but combined with the earlier service creation, it might indicate someone is probing the system for vulnerabilities or looking to install drivers, which could be a vector for malware.\n\nNow, putting this all together. The first two events are definitely suspicious because creating and starting a new service with a non-standard executable is a common attack technique. The other events might be benign, but the presence of the service creation event alone is enough to flag this batch as interesting. Even if the other commands are harmless, the combination of creating a service and scanning for INF files might indicate an attacker trying to establish persistence or exploit system vulnerabilities. The confidence here would be around 0.8 because while some events are benign, the service creation is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands creating a new service ('objeto_ativo') with a non-standard executable path and scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation sections, which may indicate persistence attempts or system enumeration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are three entries here, all related to PowerShell commands being executed. The command line is the same in each case, which is interesting. The command is checking for INF files in the Windows directory, specifically looking for sections that match certain architecture types like amd64, arm, etc. \n\nHmm, INF files are usually used for installing drivers or other system components. The script is scanning these files for specific sections. The regex they're using is looking for [defaultinstall.nt followed by architecture types. That makes me think they're checking if there are any default installation sections for different OS architectures.\n\nNow, why would someone run this script? Maybe they're trying to see if there are any driver installation sections present. But why multiple times? The same command is logged three times with different winlog tasks: Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and another Engine Lifecycle. That might be part of a larger process, like a tool that's checking the system state multiple times.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if this batch is interesting. The key here is that the script is scanning INF files, which could be part of a legitimate system check, but also could be a malicious activity. However, the script itself doesn't seem to be doing anything harmful. It's just reading files and checking for patterns. There's no modification of files, no execution of other commands, just a check.\n\nBut the repetition of the same command three times might be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a larger attack, like checking for the presence of certain driver sections before proceeding with an exploit. However, without more context, like other events that show exploitation or data exfiltration, it's hard to say. The logs here don't show any malicious actions beyond the scanning.\n\nSo, considering all that, the script is scanning INF files for specific sections. While this could be a legitimate check, the repetition and the focus on INF files might be suspicious. However, the confidence here isn't super high because there's no clear evidence of a security breach. It's more of a possible indicator that needs further investigation. I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command is executed multiple times, scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections. This could indicate reconnaissance for driver or system component exploitation, though benign checks are also possible.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
