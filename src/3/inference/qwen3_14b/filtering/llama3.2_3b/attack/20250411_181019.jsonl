{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The first entry is cmd.exe creating a service called win32times with a command line that includes starting a PowerShell script from a non-existent path, c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1. Then there's another entry for sc.exe creating the same service again, this time with a different script path, c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Both scripts don't exist, which might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are entries for services.exe modifying the registry, which could be related to changing service configurations. The sc.exe command to query the service (sc qc win32times) is also present. Then, there are image loads for calc.exe and Calculator.exe, both loading urlmon.dll. While urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, having multiple processes load it might be suspicious, especially if they're not expected.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which might be normal if it's part of logging, but the presence of a .yml.new file could indicate a configuration change. The chrome.exe entries involve registry changes and loading amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. However, multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe might be unusual.\n\nPutting this together, the main suspicious points are the creation of a service with non-existent scripts, which could be an attempt to execute malicious code later. The repeated registry changes and the use of sc.exe to manipulate services are also concerning. Even though some entries are normal (like chrome and calc), the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity trying to establish persistence or modify system settings. The confidence is around 0.75 because while there are suspicious elements, some events are benign, so it's not certain but worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of a service (win32times) with non-existent script paths, repeated registry modifications, and unusual process interactions (e.g., cmd.exe and sc.exe manipulating services).
