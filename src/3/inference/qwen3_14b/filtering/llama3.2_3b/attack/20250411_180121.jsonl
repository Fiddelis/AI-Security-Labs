Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with network connections. That's common, maybe normal browsing. But then there's powershell.exe doing some registry value sets. Not sure yet. \n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from GitHub. The URL seems to be a LICENSE.txt, which might be benign, but the fact that it's downloading files multiple times could be suspicious. There are several entries where powershell.exe is downloading files from different GitHub repositories. \n\nAlso, there are entries about image loaded, like clr.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are system files, so maybe legitimate. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. That could be a red flag if it's executing malicious code. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub, each time with a different repository path. Even though the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, the repetition and the use of PowerShell for downloads might indicate something. \n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is a log shipper, but that might be part of normal operations. Another entry is MpDefenderCoreService.exe making a network connection, which could be part of Windows Defender's normal activity. \n\nHowever, the key point here is the multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub. Even if the files are LICENSE.txt, the pattern of downloading multiple files from different repos using PowerShell could be indicative of automated scripts or potential malicious activity. The fact that they're using the WebClient object in PowerShell is a common technique used in attacks. \n\nBut I also need to consider that some of these might be legitimate, like downloading license files for software. However, the combination with the file creation in Temp and the registry changes might suggest that something more is happening. \n\nConsidering all that, I think this is interesting because the repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub, especially multiple times with different paths, could be part of a larger attack or data exfiltration. The presence of file creation in Temp directories and registry changes adds to the suspicion. So I would classify this as INTERESTING with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are downloading files from GitHub repositories (e.g., LICENSE.txt) into temporary directories, which is a common technique in malware distribution.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe setting a registry value. Not sure yet. Next, calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator.exe is a different name than calc.exe. Maybe a typo or a different process. But both are loading a legitimate system DLL. Hmm.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed, and several process creations. The cmd.exe commands are deleting scheduled tasks, like 'spawn' and registry entries. Also, reg.exe is deleting entries in HKCU's Run key. That could be part of cleaning up after some malicious activity. \n\nMultiple instances of whoami.exe and powershell.exe with empty commands. The 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be benign, but the repeated commands could be suspicious. Also, the schtasks.exe and svchost.exe interacting with the registry might be normal, but combined with the deletions, it's a red flag.\n\nThe winlogbeat file creation is in the Downloads folder, which is common, but the other events suggest someone is trying to remove traces by deleting registry entries and scheduled tasks. The use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to modify the registry could indicate an attempt to persist or cover tracks. \n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of process creation, registry modifications, and deletion of scheduled tasks. This might be part of an attack where the attacker is trying to remove evidence. So, I think this is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks (SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn), registry modifications (REG DELETE commands), and unusual process executions (powershell.exe with empty commands).

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity involving powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain events, it can be a red flag. For example, there are multiple entries with \"Pipe Created\" and \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be normal, but I should check for any unusual patterns.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. But I should note that.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them via PowerShell could be part of legitimate activities, like running .NET applications. However, if these are being loaded in an unexpected context, it might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a File Delete event for a temporary script file. Deleting a temporary file isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern of obfuscation or cleanup after malicious activity, that could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are instances of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which might be empty commands or placeholders. That could indicate that the actual command was redacted or not properly logged. That's a bit suspicious because it might be hiding malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Process Create events for PowerShell, which is normal, but combined with the other events, it might suggest that PowerShell is being used extensively, possibly for scripting or automation. However, if there's no clear purpose, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nI should also check for any registry changes. There's a Registry value set by conhost.exe and cmd.exe. While registry changes can be normal, if they're modifying keys related to security or system settings, that's more concerning. But the logs don't specify which registry keys, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which is a standard tool for checking user context. If it's being run multiple times, maybe as part of privilege escalation checks, that could be a sign of an attacker trying to determine their access level.\n\nPutting it all together: the high frequency of PowerShell events, the loading of .NET DLLs, the deletion of a temporary script file, and the presence of empty command lines might indicate that someone is using PowerShell for scripting, possibly for malicious purposes. However, without more context or additional suspicious activities (like network connections to bad IPs, unusual file modifications, etc.), it's hard to be certain. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file is more likely benign, but the combination of events makes me think this is worth investigating further. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant a closer look, but not enough to be definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events with suspicious tasks (Pipe Created, Provider Lifecycle), repeated empty command lines, and .NET DLL image loads may indicate obfuscation or malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. Let me check the winlog tasks. There are several Registry value set events, Process Create, Process Access, and Image Load events. \n\nOne of the PowerShell commands is removing files from the TEMP directory. That's odd because why would someone delete these zip files? Maybe they're trying to clean up after extracting something malicious. Also, the Image Load events show that PowerShell is loading clr.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. While that's normal, the fact that it's happening multiple times might be significant.\n\nWait, there's also a Chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are related to antivirus and security features. If Chrome is loading those, maybe there's an attempt to bypass them? Or maybe it's just normal operation. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'Remove-Item' commands in PowerShell. This could be part of a script that's trying to delete evidence. Also, the presence of multiple 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to system settings or attempts to disable security features.\n\nHowever, there are also normal processes like whoami.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. But the combination of PowerShell's suspicious activities with the file deletions and registry changes might indicate something malicious. The confidence here isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the pattern of PowerShell being used for file deletion and registry modifications is concerning. I'd say this is interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing file deletion commands (Remove-Item) in TEMP directory, combined with registry modifications and process access events, suggesting potential cleanup of malicious artifacts or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is running a command to remove a file in the TEMP directory. The command uses Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That's a bit suspicious because deleting files, especially with those parameters, might be part of cleaning up after some activity. But maybe it's just a normal script?\n\nThen there are several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading .dll files. The paths include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Some of these are standard .NET components, but MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender. Loading that might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but in the context of other events, it might be part of something malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple File Create events. One of them is creating a file in the Downloads directory. The names of the files being deleted and created are things like \"objeto_padrao.txt\", which might be part of some process, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several Process Create events for whoami.exe. Whoami is a legitimate command to get user info, but if it's being called multiple times, maybe it's part of a larger script or being used to check privileges. However, the repetition might be normal or could indicate something else.\n\nThe Registry value set events for chrome.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe might be normal, but again, if they're modifying registry keys in a way that's not standard, that could be an issue. However, the events don't specify which registry keys, so it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell commands deleting files, loading various DLLs, creating pipes, and creating files. The repetition of certain commands and the use of PowerShell for file deletion might be part of a script that's trying to clean up after itself. The loading of Defender's MpOAV.dll is interesting because it could be an attempt to bypass or interact with the antivirus. However, without more context like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut given that there are several PowerShell events with file deletions and the loading of certain DLLs, along with the Pipe Created event, this might be worth investigating further. The confidence isn't super high, but the combination of events does raise some flags. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65. Just enough to warrant a closer look but not definitive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute file deletion commands in TEMP directories, load suspicious DLLs (including Windows Defender components), and create pipes, suggesting potential cleanup or evasion activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
