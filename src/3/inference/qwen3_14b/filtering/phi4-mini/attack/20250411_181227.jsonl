{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about PowerShell processes. The command lines look similar, involving creating scheduled tasks with 'calc.exe' as the action. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights and running at logon can be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nI notice multiple entries with 'Register-ScheduledTask' with different names like 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral', etc. This repetition might indicate an attempt to create multiple scheduled tasks, which is suspicious. Also, the use of 'calc.exe' is odd here; normally, attackers might use more隐蔽 (stealthy) payloads, but using calc.exe could be a test or a way to avoid detection by using a legitimate executable.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are registry value sets and process accesses, which are common in malware activities. The 'Image loaded' events point to .NET DLLs, which might be part of the payload or a legitimate process, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's concerning.\n\nHowever, there's also a Chrome.exe event related to a pipe created. That might be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. But the majority of the logs are about PowerShell and scheduled tasks, which are the main points of interest here.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges, using PowerShell, and the repetition of similar commands are strong indicators of malicious activity. Even though some parts might be benign, the combination here is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with 'calc.exe' as the payload, configured to run at logon with 'BUILTIN\\\\Administrators' group and highest privileges.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there are multiple entries about 'powershell.exe' loading images, like mscorlib.ni.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate Windows files, so maybe normal operations. Then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory, which is common for scripts. The next event is a pipe created, which might be normal too.\n\nThen there's a command line entry for powershell.exe that's creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, set to run at logon with high privileges for Administrators. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a simple calculator, but using it in a scheduled task with elevated permissions might be a red flag. The command is using PowerShell to register a task, which could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nFollowing that, there are several registry events from chrome.exe. Chrome updating registry values isn't unusual, but the repetition might be worth checking. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell scheduled task. The other entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' have 'process' as None, which could indicate unknown or potentially malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin privileges is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of creating a scheduled task with high privileges and the repeated remote command events might suggest a security threat. However, I need to check if the scheduled task is actually malicious. Since calc.exe is a legitimate app, but using it in this way could be a trick. The confidence here is moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they might not be definitive proof without further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) that executes calc.exe at logon. This pattern is suspicious and may indicate potential malicious activity, even though calc.exe itself is legitimate.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. The first one is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe something's up if it's doing unexpected things. Then there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. That's common, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's a file created in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path is under the Tasks directory, which is used by Task Scheduler. Creating a file there might be part of setting up a scheduled task. But \"unidade_comum\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard file. Then there's a process None executing a remote command. That's suspicious because it's an unknown process. \n\nPowerShell creating files in the user's AppData and Downloads folders. That's normal for some scripts, but combined with other events? Also, the Chrome.exe entries with registry changes. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. Maybe a browser extension or malware? The Dns query from Chrome might be normal, but if it's querying unusual domains, that's bad. However, the logs don't show the domain.\n\nWinlogbeat creating a .yml.new file. That's part of configuration, maybe legitimate. But why is there a new file being created? The user might be setting up Winlogbeat, but it's not clear. The presence of multiple registry changes, file creations, and an unknown process executing a remote command could indicate a malicious activity. However, some of these events are normal. Need to weigh the suspicious elements against the usual behavior. The combination of unexpected file creation in Task Scheduler directory, unknown process, and repeated registry changes might be enough to flag this as interesting. Confidence around 0.7 because there are some legitimate events but the suspicious ones are notable.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: unknown process executing remote commands, svchost.exe modifying registry repeatedly, and file creation in system Task Scheduler directory (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\unidade_comum). These patterns may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
