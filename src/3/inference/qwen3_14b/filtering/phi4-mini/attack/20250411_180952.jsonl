{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, which is normal, but also MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. Then there's chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's common, but maybe not suspicious on its own. \n\nWait, then there's a bunch of powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. \n\nLooking at the cmd.exe entry: the command line includes adding a user with \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" to a domain, then adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a big red flag. Creating domain admin accounts is a serious security risk. Also, the passwords look like they might be temporary, but the fact that they're being added to Domain Admins is concerning. \n\nAnother cmd.exe instance runs \"net user\" and \"net group\" commands to add users and groups. Those commands are typically used for administrative tasks, but if they're being executed without proper authorization, that's a problem. Also, the presence of \"net1.exe\" which isn't a standard Windows command might be a typo or a malicious executable. \n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\pacote_base.txt\". Not sure if that's malicious, but combined with the other activities, it might be part of some data exfiltration or configuration. \n\nThe svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log files is normal, as that's part of the System Resource Usage tracking. So those are probably benign. \n\nThe key suspicious points are the creation of domain admin accounts, the use of cmd.exe and net commands to modify user and group memberships, and the presence of non-standard executables like net1.exe. These activities could indicate an attacker trying to escalate privileges or set up persistent access. \n\nAlso, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with network-related tasks and registry modifications might be part of a larger attack. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch includes activities that are highly suspicious, especially the creation of domain admin accounts and the use of commands that modify system security settings. Therefore, this batch should be classified as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin accounts via 'net user' and 'net group' commands, use of non-standard 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe', and PowerShell\/CMD executions that could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. These are strong indicators of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it's common for it to create configuration files. The file path seems legitimate, and the task is FileCreate, which might be part of its normal operation.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set event from powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool, and registry changes can be part of normal system administration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. The third event is a Process accessed by powershell.exe. Again, PowerShell accessing processes is normal, but it could also be part of a script that's doing something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the combination, all three events involve PowerShell and winlogbeat. Winlogbeat creating a file is likely benign. The PowerShell events might be part of a script that's configuring or interacting with the system. However, there's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual file paths, unexpected network activity, or other red flags. Since there's no evidence of compromise or suspicious behavior beyond normal operations, I'd classify this as not interesting. The confidence is moderate because while the events are normal, the presence of PowerShell in multiple events could be a red herring if there's more context missing.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard system operations: winlogbeat creating a configuration file and PowerShell interacting with registry\/processes, which are common in normal system administration. No suspicious indicators (e.g., unusual file paths, network activity, or privilege escalation) are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
