{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe being accessed. That's common, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool for checking user identity. But then there's another powershell.exe access. Next, a registry value set event from powershell. That might be suspicious because modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process creating a registry entry under Run keys. The command line shows adding a registry entry for \"estrutura_principal.exe\" in the user's Downloads folder. That's a red flag because adding an entry to Run can cause the executable to launch at startup, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nNext, reg.exe is used to add another entry to the Run key, pointing to \"pacote_temporario.exe\". Again, this is suspicious. Both estrutura_principal.exe and pacote_temporario.exe are in the Downloads directory, which is often used by attackers to store malicious files.\n\nThen there's a file creation event for modulo_padrao.txt by powershell.exe. Not sure about that yet. The winlogbeat.exe events are about creating .yml.new files, which might be part of configuration changes, but not necessarily malicious. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe and the registry modifications are concerning.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry, especially in Run keys. The use of cmd.exe and reg.exe to add startup entries suggests an attempt to persist on the system. The creation of files in the Downloads folder could be part of initial exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The file names like modulo_padrao.txt might be benign, but combined with the registry changes, it's more suspicious. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files might be normal if it's a monitoring tool, but if it's being used inappropriately, that's a problem. However, the main red flags here are the registry modifications and the use of PowerShell for these actions, which are common in attacks.\n\nConsidering all events together, the repeated registry changes and the use of PowerShell to add startup entries are strong indicators of malicious activity. Even though some files might be normal, the combination of events points towards an attempt to establish persistence. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell and cmd.exe modifying registry Run keys to add persistence entries (estrutura_principal.exe, pacote_temporario.exe), combined with file creation in user Downloads directory. Registry modification via reg.exe and PowerShell aligns with common attack patterns for persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
