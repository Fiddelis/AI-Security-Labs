{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed (ProcessAccess) and some process creations like whoami.exe and cmd.exe. The cmd.exe line is using wmic to create notepad.exe. That's a bit suspicious because wmic is often used in attacks. Then there's WMIC.exe loading several DLLs, including urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and some Windows Defender DLLs. Loading amsi.dll might be an attempt to bypass antivirus, since AMSI is part of the antimalware scanning interface. \n\nThen, there's a file created by powershell.exe named objeto_temporario.txt. That's a temporary file, maybe used to store data. Also, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's just normal activity, but if it's creating configuration files, could be part of setup or maybe tampering. \n\nOther processes like conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe have registry changes, which might be normal, but combined with the other events... The repeated access to powershell.exe and the loading of specific DLLs by WMIC could indicate malicious activity. The use of WMIC to execute processes and the loading of DLLs from Windows Defender's path might be a red flag. Also, the creation of a temporary file could be part of data exfiltration or command and control.\n\nBut I need to check if all these are benign. For example, whoami.exe is a legitimate tool, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell could indicate that it's being used to run scripts or commands. The registry changes might be part of persistence mechanisms. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's environment or known good behavior, it's hard to be certain. But the combination of these events—WMIC loading suspicious DLLs, multiple PowerShell accesses, and file creation—raises enough flags to consider this interesting for further investigation. The confidence is high, but not 100% certain. Maybe around 0.85.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell access, WMIC loading potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll), and creation of temporary files.
