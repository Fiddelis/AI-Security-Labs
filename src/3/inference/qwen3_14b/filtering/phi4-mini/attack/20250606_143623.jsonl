The service is named 'objeto_ativo' and the binary path points to 'tarefa_logico.exe' in a non-standard directory: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe'. That path doesn't look like a typical Windows system path. Creating a new service with a custom executable could be a red flag, especially if the executable is in an unusual location.\n\nThen, looking at the image loaded events. PowerShell is loading several DLLs, some of which are .NET related, which is normal. However, there's also 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' from Windows Defender. That might be normal too, but not sure. However, the key point here is the creation of the service with a suspicious binary path.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events from 'services.exe', but that's part of the Windows service control manager, so maybe legitimate. However, the main concern is the 'New-Service' command in PowerShell. Creating a new service with a non-standard executable path could be an indicator of malicious activity, like installing a backdoor or persistent malware.\n\nAdditionally, there's a file delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. That might be part of cleanup, but if it's deleting its own script after execution, that could be an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with an executable in a non-system directory, combined with multiple PowerShell activities and registry changes, suggests potential malicious behavior.

Both of these are system processes, and they do interact with the registry. However, seeing so many registry events from these processes might be a sign of something.

Also, the process 'services.exe' is also doing registry sets multiple times.\n\nAnother thing to note: the first two entries are from a non-system process (tarefa_logico.exe) loading system DLLs. That's not unusual if it's a .NET application, but maybe the name 'tarefa_logico.exe' is a red flag if it's not a known legitimate application. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe entry with 'MsMpEng.exe' (Microsoft's Malicious Software Removal Tool) setting a registry value is normal.

However, the presence of multiple DLL files in the Temp folder might be a red flag.

This tool is known to generate temporary files during operations like Windows updates or image deployments.\n\n2. **File Locations and Types**: \n   - Files are created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Temp`** directory, which is a standard location for temporary files during system processes.\n   - The files include **DLLs and MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files** (e.g., `DismProv.dll`, `DismProv.dll.mui`). These are consistent with legitimate components used by `Dism.exe` during deployment or update workflows.\n\n3. **Event Types**: \n   - **\"File Executable Detected\"** and **\"File created\"** events are triggered by the system's logging rules. These are not inherently malicious in this context, as `Dism.exe` is authorized to create and use such files during its normal operations.\n\n4. **Absence of Suspicious Indicators**: \n   - No anomalies like unexpected network activity, unauthorized user interaction, or execution of suspicious files are mentioned.\n   - The files listed are not known malware signatures or commonly associated with malicious behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity aligns with **normal system behavior** during a deployment or update process. The presence of multiple files in the Temp directory is expected for tools like `Dism.exe`. **No further investigation is warranted** unless additional context (e.g., unusual process behavior, unexpected network traffic) is present. \n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING` (Legitimate system activity)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are 15 entries here, all related to the Dism.exe process. Each entry has a winlog task indicating \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files mentioned are all .dll.mui files located in the Temp directory under the user's AppData. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Dism.exe does. Dism is the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, used for managing Windows images. It's a legitimate tool, but it can be abused by attackers for malicious purposes. The key here is the files being detected as executables. Normally, .mui files are resource files for language packs, not executables. \n\nWait, the rule is called FileExecutableDetected, which suggests that the system's security software (like Windows Defender) is flagging these .mui files as executable. That's unusual because .mui files are typically data files, not executables. If Dism.exe is loading or executing these files, that might be a red flag. \n\nNow, looking at the file paths: they all start with a GUID in the Temp folder. The presence of multiple .dll.mui files in the Temp directory might indicate that someone is trying to inject malicious code or exploit a vulnerability. Since Dism.exe is a system tool, if it's being used to execute these files, it could be part of a malicious process. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a legitimate reason for this. Maybe during a system update or image deployment, Dism could be handling these files. But the fact that all these files are in the Temp directory and are being flagged as executables is suspicious. Legitimate Dism operations usually don't involve executing .mui files from the Temp folder. \n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same GUID in the path. That might indicate that these files are part of a single operation or possibly a malicious payload being staged in the Temp directory. The use of the Temp directory is common for malware to store temporary files before execution. \n\nI should also check if the rule FileExecutableDetected is a known false positive. But given that the files are .mui, which are not typically executable, this seems more like a security alert that needs investigation. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of Dism.exe, the unusual file types being flagged as executable, and their location in the Temp directory suggests a potential security incident. It's not definitive proof of malware, but the indicators are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a potential security concern. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Involved**: All events involve `Dism.exe`, a legitimate Windows tool for managing system images. However, its use here may be anomalous.\n2. **File Types**: The flagged files are `.dll.mui` (Microsoft UI language resource files), which are typically **data files**, **not executables**. Their detection as \"executable\" by the security rule (`FileExecutableDetected`) is unusual.\n3. **File Location**: All files are in the **user's Temp directory** (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`), a common location for malware to stage temporary files.\n4. **GUID in Path**: The presence of a GUID (`3B77A2E4-7A66-495F-BE5C-53A1E6D59D6A`) suggests the files may be part of a staged operation or payload.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Suspicious File Execution**: `.mui` files are not typically executed. If `Dism.exe` is attempting to load or execute them, this could indicate **exploitation** (e.g., a vulnerability in Dism or related components).\n- **Malicious Use of Temp Directory**: The Temp directory is often used by malware to store transient files, which may be part of a **payload delivery or execution chain**.\n- **Unusual Behavior**: Legitimate Dism operations rarely involve executing `.mui` files from the Temp directory. This could signal **tool abuse** or **malware masquerading as a system process**.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate Further**:\n   - Check the **process tree** to see if `Dism.exe` is interacting with these files.\n   - Analyze the **file hashes** of the `.dll.mui` files to determine if they match known malicious signatures.\n   - Review **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., Security, Application) for related events (e.g., process creation, file access).\n2. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Confirm if the user or system is undergoing a **legitimate Windows deployment or imaging task** that might involve these files.\n   - Check for **unusual network activity** or **registry changes** around the time of these events.\n3. **Mitigation**:\n   - If malicious activity is confirmed, **isolate the affected system**, remove the files, and perform a full system scan.\n   - Ensure **Windows updates** and **antivirus definitions** are current to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile `Dism.exe` is a legitimate tool, the combination of **unusual file types**, **Temp directory usage**, and **execution of non-executable files** raises significant concerns. This warrants immediate investigation to rule out **malware activity** or **exploitation**."}

Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Tools Involved:**\n   - **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** are legitimate Windows tools used for deployment, imaging, and managing Windows images. Their presence alone is not suspicious.\n\n2. **Unusual File Activity:**\n   - **Dism.exe** executes a file (`WimProvider.dll`) in the Temp directory (`%Temp%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\`).\n   - **DismHost.exe** subsequently loads **14 DLLs** from the same directory, all with names like `AppxProvider.dll`, `SmiProvider.dll`, etc.\n   - **Dism.exe** later deletes one of the DLLs (`AppxProvider.dll`).\n\n3. **Suspicious Patterns:**\n   - **Temporary Directory Usage:** While Temp directories are often used for transient files, loading **multiple DLLs** from a single, newly created Temp directory (with a unique GUID) is atypical for legitimate processes. Legitimate tools typically do not load numerous DLLs from Temp folders.\n   - **Post-Execution Cleanup:** The deletion of a DLL (`AppxProvider.dll`) after it was loaded may indicate an attempt to erase evidence of activity, though this is not conclusive without further context.\n\n4. **Provider DLLs:**\n   - The DLLs loaded (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `SmiProvider.dll`) are associated with Windows Imaging and Deployment, but their presence in a Temp directory raises questions. Legitimate providers are usually part of the system's trusted binaries, not dynamically loaded from user-writable locations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** All files are in a Temp directory with a unique GUID, which may be a temporary staging area for malicious payloads.\n- **High Volume of DLL Loads:** The number of DLLs loaded from the same directory (14) is unusually high for a single process.\n- **File Deletion Post-Execution:** Deleting a file immediately after loading it could suggest cleanup of transient or potentially malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Analyze the DLLs:**\n   - Verify the **signatures** and **origins** of the loaded DLLs. If they are unsigned or from unknown sources, this strongly suggests malicious activity.\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **ProcDump** to inspect the DLLs' contents and behavior.\n\n2. **Check for Code Signing:**\n   - Confirm whether the DLLs are signed by Microsoft or a trusted entity. Unsigned or tampered binaries are red flags.\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Investigate if other processes or users interacted with the Temp directory or if there are network connections to external servers during this activity.\n\n4. **Monitor for Repeated Behavior:**\n   - If this pattern recurs, it may indicate a **malware dropper** or **living-off-the-land** attack leveraging legitimate tools for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** are legitimate, the **unusual volume of DLLs loaded from a Temp directory** and the **subsequent deletion of one file** suggest **potential malicious activity**. This behavior aligns with tactics used by malware to execute payloads in memory (e.g., **Reflective DLL Injection**) and clean up traces. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is benign or malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** **Suspicious** – warrants deeper analysis of the DLLs and their origins."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are related to the Dism.exe process, which I know is part of the Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management. The winlog task is mostly \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\" with a few instances of \"File creation time changed (rule: FileCreateTime)\". The files being deleted are in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder, and they have names like AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, etc. \n\nNow, Dism.exe is typically used for tasks like deploying Windows images, applying updates, and managing packages. It's a legitimate tool, but sometimes attackers might abuse it for malicious purposes. However, in this case, the files being deleted are all in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files. The fact that multiple files are being deleted by Dism.exe could be part of a normal operation, like cleaning up after an image deployment or a system update.\n\nBut wait, the same GUID folder is used for all these files. That might indicate that these files were part of a specific operation, and their deletion is part of that process. However, the presence of both .dll and .mui files (which are language-specific resource files) might be normal for some deployment tasks. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any unusual behavior. For example, if Dism.exe was deleting files that are not typically associated with its normal operations, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the files seem to be related to providers and core components of DISM, which might be part of a legitimate process. \n\nAnother point is the repeated deletion of multiple files. If this is part of a normal cleanup, it's acceptable. However, without additional context like other events (e.g., process creation, network activity, or changes in other directories), it's hard to determine if this is malicious. \n\nBut since all the events are related to file deletions by a legitimate process in a temporary directory, and there's no indication of unexpected behavior or anomalies in the logs provided, it's more likely a normal operation. Therefore, the risk here seems low, and the events are probably benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **`Dism.exe`** process (Windows Deployment Imaging Service and Management) deleting multiple `.dll` and `.mui` files from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **Legitimate Tool**:  \n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a core Windows utility used for tasks like deploying OS images, managing packages, and applying updates. Its deletion of files in the `%TEMP%` directory is consistent with its normal operations (e.g., cleaning up temporary deployment artifacts).\n\n2. **File Context**:  \n   - The files being deleted (e.g., `AssocProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`, `DismCore.dll`, and their `.mui` counterparts) are associated with DISM's internal components and language resources. This aligns with typical use cases, such as:\n     - Post-deployment cleanup.\n     - Temporary storage of provider modules during system updates.\n\n3. **No Anomalies**:  \n   - The logs show **no signs of suspicious activity** (e.g., unexpected file paths, elevated privileges, or network activity).  \n   - The use of a temporary directory and a GUID-based folder name is standard for transient operations.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe behavior is **likely benign** and part of a legitimate DISM operation (e.g., image deployment, update rollback, or cleanup). **No immediate threat** is indicated in the provided logs. However, further context (e.g., process parentage, network activity, or user context) would strengthen the assessment.\n\n### **Recommendation**:\n- **Monitor for unusual patterns** (e.g., repeated deletions outside `%TEMP%`, unexpected parent processes, or lateral movement).  \n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., `Event Viewer` for system updates or deployment events) to confirm the operation's intent.  \n- **No action required** based on the current data."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all from the Dism.exe process, and each one is logging a file delete event. The files being deleted are all .mui files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Dism.exe is. DISM is the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, used for offline servicing of Windows images. It's commonly used in system deployment and image management. So, normally, DISM might delete temporary files after performing operations like applying updates or packages.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files. The GUID in the path suggests that these files might be part of a specific operation or session. The fact that multiple .mui files are being deleted could be part of a normal cleanup process after DISM has finished its task.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual pattern. The same process (Dism.exe) is deleting multiple files. But since DISM is a legitimate tool, this might be expected. However, if these deletions are happening outside of a known DISM operation, it could be suspicious. But the logs don't show any other processes or events that indicate malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the rule triggering the logs: FileDeleteDetected. If this is a standard monitoring rule, then DISM's actions are being logged as expected. There's no indication of unauthorized access or unexpected deletions here. The files are temporary, so their deletion is likely part of normal operations.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many deletions? Maybe DISM was handling a large number of files, but that's possible. Alternatively, if the user is not running a deployment task, this might be unusual. However, without additional context like other processes or user activities, it's hard to tell. \n\nSince all events are related to a legitimate process performing expected actions on temporary files, I think this is likely a normal activity. There's no evidence of malware or unauthorized deletions. The key here is that the process is known and the files are temporary. Therefore, the logs don't indicate a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool)** process is deleting multiple `.mui` (Microsoft UI) files from the **temporary directory** (`AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{GUID}`) as part of its normal operations. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:  \n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a legitimate Windows tool used for managing and servicing Windows images (e.g., applying updates, packages, or preparing system images). It often generates temporary files during operations, which are later cleaned up.\n\n2. **Temporary Files**:  \n   - The files being deleted (`.mui` files) are likely temporary resources created during a DISM operation (e.g., applying a package or update). The presence of a **GUID** in the path suggests these files were generated for a specific session or task.\n\n3. **Expected Behavior**:  \n   - DISM frequently creates and deletes temporary files in the `Temp` directory as part of its workflow. The repeated deletion of `.mui` files here aligns with this behavior.\n\n4. **No Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - There is **no evidence of unauthorized access**, unexpected processes, or suspicious activity. The logs reflect a standard cleanup operation by a trusted system tool.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **likely benign** and part of DISM's normal operations. The deletion of temporary `.mui` files in the `Temp` directory is expected during or after a DISM task. **No immediate security threat** is indicated by these logs.\n\n**Classification**: **False Positive \/ Normal System Activity**  \n**Recommendation**: No action required unless correlated with other anomalous events (e.g., unexpected DISM execution, unauthorized user activity)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are about files being deleted by Dism.exe. The files are in the Temp directory under a specific UUID folder. The names of the files include various provider DLLs like WimProvider.dll.mui, FfuProvider.dll, etc.\n\nHmm, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. It's common during system setup or image deployment. But why so many files being deleted? The Temp directory is often used for temporary files, so maybe this is part of a normal process. However, the fact that multiple provider DLLs are being deleted could be a red flag. \n\nWait, but if this is part of a legitimate operation, like a system image deployment, it's possible that these files are temporary and being cleaned up. The UUID in the path might indicate a specific session or operation. But I should consider if there's any unusual pattern here. Are these deletions happening in a context that's not typical for Dism.exe?\n\nAlso, the rule triggering these logs is FileDeleteDetected. If the system is configured to log all file deletions, this might just be normal activity. However, if the user hasn't initiated any such process, this could be suspicious. But the logs don't show any other processes or events that indicate malicious activity. \n\nI need to check if deleting multiple provider DLLs in the Temp folder is normal. Since these files are in Temp, they might be temporary files created during the operation. Without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to say.

However, the high number of deletions could be worth investigating. \n\nConsidering all that, the logs might not be malicious. But the high volume of deletions could be a sign of something. I'm leaning towards it being a legitimate process, but the system administrator should verify if this activity aligns with any ongoing deployments or imaging tasks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate that **Dism.exe** (a legitimate Windows tool for deployment and imaging) is deleting multiple provider DLL files from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\{UUID}\\...`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Tool:**  \n   - **Dism.exe** is a standard Windows utility used during system deployment, imaging, or configuration. It often interacts with temporary files during these processes.\n\n2. **File Location and Naming:**  \n   - The files are in the `%TEMP%` directory, which is typical for temporary files created during system operations.  \n   - The filenames (e.g., `WimProvider.dll.mui`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) suggest they are part of a deployment or imaging workflow, possibly related to **Windows Setup**, **Sysprep**, or **custom imaging tools**.\n\n3. **UUID in the Path:**  \n   - The `{UUID}` in the path (`3BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-C4B96B8A3B2E`) likely corresponds to a specific session or operation (e.g., a deployment task). This is common in temporary directories for tracking session-specific files.\n\n4. **No Anomalies in the Logs:**  \n   - The logs only show **file deletions** by **Dism.exe**. There are no indications of unauthorized processes, unexpected network activity, or other suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **Likely Legitimate:**  \n  This activity is consistent with **normal system deployment or imaging operations**. For example:\n  - During **Windows Setup**, **Sysprep**, or **custom image creation**, Dism.exe may clean up temporary files after completing a task.\n  - The use of a UUID in the directory name aligns with temporary session-specific operations.\n\n- **Potential Red Flags (if applicable):**  \n  - If **no deployment or imaging task** is actively running, this could indicate **unauthorized activity**.  \n  - If this occurs **repeatedly** or **outside of known deployment windows**, further investigation is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with System Context:**  \n   - Check if a **deployment, imaging, or Sysprep** task is running (e.g., via Task Manager, Event Viewer, or command-line tools like `dism \/get-imageinfo`).\n\n2. **Monitor for Additional Activity:**  \n   - Look for **other processes** or **network traffic** that might indicate a broader operation (e.g., downloading files, modifying system configurations).\n\n3. **Review System Logs:**  \n   - Check **Windows Event Viewer** for related events (e.g., under **\"Windows Logs > System\"** or **\"Application\"**) to confirm the context of the deletions.\n\n4. **If Unrelated to Deployment:**  \n   - Investigate further for potential **malware** or **compromise**, especially if this activity is unexpected or recurring.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**This activity is likely legitimate** if aligned with a known deployment or imaging task.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON log entries, and they want me to analyze them. Hmm, the logs seem to be from a Windows system, given the \"winlog\" entries. The main focus here is on the \"process\" field, which has command lines related to PowerShell and service creation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the same command line: creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path and then starting it. That's a red flag. Why would someone create a service with that name and path? The path is in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". Those directories and filenames look a bit unusual. Maybe they're part of a malicious payload or a legitimate application? Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Those might be related to the execution of PowerShell scripts. The \"ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" is set, which is the default, so that's not necessarily suspicious. But the command is writing \"Final result: 1\" to the host. Maybe that's just a test or a placeholder.\n\nLooking at the first entry, the process is \"svchost.exe\" with a Registry value set. That could be related to service creation, but the registry event might be part of the service setup. However, the repeated creation of the \"objeto_ativo\" service might indicate an attempt to persist the malicious activity, which is common in malware.\n\nWait, the user might be concerned about potential security threats here. The repeated PowerShell commands and the creation of a new service could be signs of an attack. The service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't ring any bells as a standard Windows service. Also, the path \"C:\\unidade_logico...\" is not a typical system directory. That might be a custom or user-created directory, which could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is that the same command is repeated multiple times. That might be part of a script or an automated process, but if it's being done multiple times in a short period, it could be an indicator of compromise. Also, the use of \"New-Service\" and \"Start-Service\" in PowerShell is a common method for creating and starting services, which is often used by attackers to maintain persistence.\n\nI should check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a legitimate file. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the name translates to \"logical task\" in Portuguese, which is a bit vague. Maybe it's a legitimate application, but the lack of information makes it suspicious.\n\nThe user might need to investigate these logs further. They should check the files in the mentioned directories, verify their digital signatures, and see if there's any unusual network activity from the service. Also, looking into the registry changes and the PowerShell execution policy might be necessary.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the repeated service creation, the unusual file paths, and the use of PowerShell for these actions. These could be signs of a security threat, and further investigation is recommended.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate suspicious activity on a Windows system, potentially involving malware or unauthorized processes. Here's a structured analysis and response:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - Repeated use of `New-Service` and `Start-Service` to create a service named **`objeto_ativo`** (translated to \"active object\") with the binary path:\n     ```\n     C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\n     ```\n   - **`tarefa_logico.exe`** (translated to \"logical task\") is a non-standard executable, and the directory structure (`unidade_logico`, `registro_comum`, etc.) is not part of typical Windows system paths. This is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:\n   - The command line includes:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\n     ```\n   - While `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is the default and not inherently malicious, the combination with `Write-Host` could be a placeholder or test command. However, the repeated execution of this command may indicate automated scripts or persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Log Entries**:\n   - Multiple entries with **`Provider Lifecycle`** and **`Engine Lifecycle`** tasks suggest PowerShell activity being monitored or logged by a security tool (e.g., Windows Defender, SIEM, or EDR).\n   - The absence of file details in the logs makes it harder to assess the legitimacy of `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n4. **Registry Event**:\n   - A log entry from **`svchost.exe`** with a **Registry value set** could be related to service configuration changes, but further context is needed to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n1. **Persistence via Service**:\n   - Creating a new service (`objeto_ativo`) is a common technique for malware to maintain persistence on a system. The service could be a backdoor or dropper for further malicious activity.\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths**:\n   - The non-standard directory structure and executable name (`tarefa_logico.exe`) are red flags. Legitimate applications typically use well-known paths (e.g., `C:\\Program Files`).\n\n3. **Lack of Visibility**:\n   - The absence of file metadata (e.g., digital signatures, hashes) in the logs makes it difficult to determine if the executable is malicious or legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Investigate the Executable**:\n   - Check the file **`tarefa_logico.exe`** in the specified path:\n     - Verify its **digital signature** (if signed).\n     - Analyze its **hash** using threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).\n     - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to inspect its behavior.\n\n2. **Check for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Monitor network traffic from `tarefa_logico.exe` for unusual outbound connections.\n   - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Microsoft Defender ATP** to detect data exfiltration or C2 communication.\n\n3. **Remove the Service**:\n   - If the service is confirmed malicious, delete it:\n     ```powershell\n     Stop-Service -Name objeto_ativo\n     Remove-Service -Name objeto_ativo\n     ```\n   - Ensure no residual files remain in the directory.\n\n4. **Audit PowerShell Usage**:\n   - Review PowerShell logs (e.g., **Windows Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security**) for unauthorized script execution.\n   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies (e.g., **`Restricted`** or **`AllSigned`**) to prevent future unauthorized scripts.\n\n5. **Check for Root Cause**:\n   - Investigate how the service was initially created (e.g., via phishing, exploit, or lateral movement).\n   - Scan the system for malware using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest the presence of a potentially malicious service (`objeto_ativo`) and executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`). Immediate action is required to:\n- **Isolate the affected system** (if necessary).\n- **Analyze the suspicious files**.\n- **Remove the service** and investigate the root cause.\n\nIf the system is part of a network, propagate the investigation to other endpoints to check for similar patterns."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user provided a batch of JSONL entries, each representing a process event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the entries are about PowerShell commands being executed with the -ExecutionPolicy Restricted parameter. The first few entries have simple commands like Write-Host 'Final result: 1', which seems benign. But then there's a pattern where several entries have a more complex PowerShell script. \n\nLooking at the command_line for those, they're scanning INF files in the Windows directory for specific sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. The script checks for these sections and sets a result variable. The purpose here might be to detect the presence of certain installation configurations. However, why would this be suspicious?\n\nWell, INF files are typically used for installing drivers or software. The script is looking for sections that might indicate hardware-specific installations. But the fact that this is done via PowerShell with Restricted execution policy is a bit odd. Usually, Restricted policy prevents scripts from running, but maybe the user is testing or checking for something. \n\nWait, the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default. However, the script is still running. That might not be an issue. But the repetition of the same command in multiple events could be a red flag. Are these events from different times or the same? The JSON doesn't have timestamps, but the repetition might indicate automated scanning or a script that's being run multiple times, possibly as part of a larger process.\n\nAnother point is that the script is scanning INF files. If this is part of a legitimate process, like a system check or a software installer, it might be okay. However, if an attacker is trying to find INF files that could be used for persistence or to install malicious software, this could be a sign of reconnaissance. \n\nBut the script itself doesn't have any malicious commands. It's just reading files and checking for patterns. However, the fact that it's being run multiple times, especially with the same command line, might indicate that someone is trying to check for specific INF files that could be part of a larger attack. \n\nAlso, the combination of Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in the winlog might be part of a system's normal operations, but the repetition could be suspicious. \n\nI need to weigh whether this is normal behavior or indicative of something malicious. Since the script is not executing any harmful actions but is scanning files, it's possible that it's part of a legitimate tool. However, the high number of similar events might suggest that it's being run repeatedly, which could be part of an investigation or an automated scan. \n\nConsidering all this, the classification is likely \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated scanning of INF files with PowerShell might be part of a larger malicious activity, even though the commands themselves are not directly harmful. The confidence is around 0.7 because while the actions aren't obviously malicious, the repetition and the nature of the script (scanning system files) could be suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are scanning Windows INF files for specific patterns, which could indicate reconnaissance for potential exploitation of driver installation mechanisms.
