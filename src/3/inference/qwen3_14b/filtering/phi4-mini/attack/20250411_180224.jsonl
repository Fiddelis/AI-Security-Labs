First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe command line that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line includes running a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to obfuscate the real path?\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating a task again, with a similar command line. The file created is C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. Scheduled tasks in System32 can be a sign of persistence. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a high-privilege context. That's concerning.\n\nThen there are multiple svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is normal, but multiple registry changes might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The chrome.exe entries are all registry value sets, but since Chrome is a common application, maybe they're just normal operations. However, having so many registry events from chrome might be unusual, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entries are creating files, which could be part of normal operations if it's a log shipper. But the filenames are .yml.new, which might be part of configuration updates. Not sure yet.\n\nPutting it all together: the key points are the schtasks creating a scheduled task with a PowerShell script that's named NonExistingScript, which might be a typo or obfuscation. The use of -ep bypass is a common technique in attacks. Also, the task is set to run daily under the system account, which is a sign of persistence. The multiple registry changes from svchost and chrome might be noise, but the scheduled task seems suspicious. However, there's no direct evidence of the script being executed or any malicious payload. The files mentioned are non-existent, so maybe the attacker is trying to create a task that doesn't actually run anything, or the script is elsewhere. Alternatively, the script path might be a misdirection.\n\nConfidence is a bit low because there's no execution of the script, just creation of the task. But the combination of scheduled tasks under system, using PowerShell with bypass, and non-existent script names is enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate suspicious scheduled task creation via schtasks.exe with PowerShell scripts named 'NonExistingScript.ps1', which may be obfuscation. Tasks are configured to run daily under the SYSTEM account, a common persistence technique. While no direct execution of malicious payloads is observed, the combination of registry modifications, task creation, and non-existent file references warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_ativo.txt. That's a normal user directory, maybe they're just saving a file. But PowerShell is often used for scripting, so maybe something's up.\n\nSecond event: PowerShell.exe accessed a process. Not sure what process, but accessing processes can be suspicious if it's unauthorized. But without more context, hard to tell.\n\nThird event: whoami.exe was executed. That's a standard command to get user info. Maybe part of a legitimate script or part of a malicious act. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nFourth event: Another PowerShell.exe process accessed a process. Repeating the same action. Maybe trying to access multiple processes? Could be part of a larger attack, but again, need more info.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple PowerShell instances creating files and accessing processes. Whoami is a low-risk command. However, PowerShell is often used in attacks. The file created is in a user's Downloads folder, which is common for legitimate activity, but if there's a pattern of unusual process accesses, that might be a red flag. But with just these four events, it's not conclusive. Maybe the user is just running some scripts. However, the repetition of PowerShell accessing processes might indicate something. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING but with moderate confidence because there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, even if it's not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes performing file creation and process access actions, which may indicate potential malicious activity or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
