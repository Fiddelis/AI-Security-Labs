The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: 'whoami.exe' is executed. That's a normal Windows command to get the current user, so probably benign. But then there's a bunch of 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is common, but the events here might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's using 'findstr' and 'select-string' to search for 'password' in various file types. That could be part of a password search, which is a common attack technique. The command is run multiple times, which might indicate someone is trying to find credentials on the system.\n\nThen there are events about image loading. PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll is normal, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be relevant. However, the main concern here is the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords. \n\nAlso, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The file is a PowerShell script, which could be malicious. \n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's execution policy or something else, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the combination of searching for passwords, creating and deleting files, and multiple PowerShell executions raises a red flag. \n\nI should check if there are any other suspicious activities. The 'Registry value set' events could indicate changes to the system, but without knowing what's being changed, it's hard to assess. However, the main points are the password search and the file operations. \n\nConsidering all this, the batch shows behavior that's commonly seen in attacks, like searching for sensitive information and attempting to hide traces.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a normal process for a log shipper, so probably not an issue. Then there's notepad.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Those are common processes, but registry changes can be a red flag if they're unexpected. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process running a command to find passwords in files. The command line uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' or 'password' in various file types. This could be a sign of someone trying to find sensitive information on the system. That seems suspicious. \n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. That might be normal, but if it's part of an attempt to persist or execute code, it could be malicious. However, the justification here is that the user is searching for passwords, which is a classic sign of data exfiltration or reconnaissance. \n\nThere are multiple instances of chrome.exe and other processes making DNS queries and registry changes, but those are common in normal operations. However, the repeated registry value sets might be part of a larger attack, but without more evidence like unexpected network traffic or file modifications, it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nThe key point here is the use of PowerShell to search for password-related terms. This is a common tactic in malware or insider threats looking to gather sensitive information. Even though some events might be benign, the presence of that specific command line stands out. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.7 because while the PowerShell command is suspicious, it's not definitive proof of a security incident.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries. That's pretty normal, right? Chrome often does DNS lookups when you browse the web. But then there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a legitimate setup. But why is it creating a .yml.new file? Maybe it's just a temporary file during configuration, but I should note that.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's path. That seems okay because Windows Defender's components are legitimate. But wait, the file path is MpOAV.dll. I know that's part of Microsoft's antivirus, so that's probably normal. However, if this were a malicious DLL, that could be a problem, but the path looks legitimate.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. Chrome does modify the registry for settings, so that's normal. However, if there were unexpected changes, that could be a red flag. But in this case, without more context, it's hard to tell. The events just mention the task, not the specific registry keys.\n\nThen there are network connection events from chrome.exe. Again, normal for a browser. But multiple connections might be part of regular browsing. However, if there were connections to suspicious IPs or domains, that would be a concern. But the logs don't specify those details here.\n\nLooking further, there are two instances of powershell.exe creating files in the Downloads folder: \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". Creating text files might be normal, but it's worth checking if these files contain anything suspicious. However, the logs don't show the content, just the filenames. Also, there's a ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe, which might indicate someone trying to access the process, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe execution. That's a standard command to check user context. It's common in scripts or during troubleshooting, so that's probably benign.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are normal activities like DNS queries, file creation by legitimate processes, and registry changes by Chrome. The only slightly unusual thing is the repeated registry events and the file creations by PowerShell. But without more context, like unusual registry keys or suspicious file contents, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a config file might be part of a legitimate log setup, but if this is unexpected in the environment, it could be a point of interest.\n\nHowever, since all the events don't show clear signs of compromise—like unexpected network traffic to known bad IPs, unusual file modifications, or privilege escalation attempts—the overall picture seems to be normal system activity. Unless there's a specific reason to suspect these actions (like a known attack pattern), the classification might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\". But I should check if there's any pattern I'm missing. The repetition of certain events might be normal, like Chrome's regular operations. The PowerShell files could be part of user activity, maybe generating reports or logs. So, without more evidence, it's probably not a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily reflect normal user and system activity (e.g., Chrome DNS queries, legitimate file creation by winlogbeat\/powershell, and standard registry modifications).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the log entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. The first event shows cmd.exe running schtasks to delete scheduled tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be normal, but maybe if these tasks were malicious or if the deletion is part of a larger attack, like covering tracks. But I need to check if there's more.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being used multiple times to delete other tasks. The command lines here are similar, using \/delete and \/tn with different task names. This might be part of a process to remove existing scheduled tasks, which could be a sign of an attacker trying to clean up after installing malicious tasks.\n\nAnother thing is the use of WMIC.exe to delete processes, specifically notepad.exe. Using WMIC to delete processes can be a red flag because it's a command-line tool that can be abused for malicious purposes. Also, the command line here is using redirection to suppress output, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThere's also a lot of Registry value set events and Process accessed events. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, like changing startup entries or other configurations. The fact that multiple registry events are occurring might indicate an attempt to modify system settings for persistence.\n\nThe Image loaded events mention loading dlls like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. While some of these are legitimate, the context here is important. If these dlls are being loaded from unexpected locations or in an unusual way, it could be a sign of malware. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the combination of events: multiple deletions of scheduled tasks, use of WMIC to delete processes, registry modifications, and the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe. These could be part of a multi-stage attack where the attacker is trying to remove traces, modify system configurations, and execute commands. However, without seeing the actual content of the tasks being deleted or the registry changes, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the fact that there are multiple deletions and modifications, along with the use of tools like WMIC and PowerShell, which are commonly used in attacks, makes me think this is worth investigating further.\n\nThe confidence level would be around 0.75 because while the events are suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, the combination of multiple suspicious activities across different processes and system components increases the likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of scheduled tasks via schtasks, use of WMIC to delete processes, frequent registry modifications, and PowerShell\/cmd.exe usage, which are commonly associated with malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user provided a bunch of JSON lines with process events. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' entries. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious tasks, so that's a red flag. Then, there are several instances of 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' being used with commands like 'net user \/del' to delete user accounts. That seems suspicious because deleting user accounts isn't a typical everyday activity. Also, the command lines have parameters like '\/del' and '\/domain', which might indicate attempts to remove users from a domain, possibly part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of 'whoami.exe', which is usually used to check the current user context. If this is done multiple times, maybe the attacker is checking their privileges or trying to escalate. Also, the 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or modifying system settings.\n\nI notice that some of the commands are using 'conhost.exe' and 'cmd.exe' with registry modifications. Conhost is a Windows console host process, but if it's being used in conjunction with registry changes, that might be part of a larger attack. The fact that multiple processes are accessing the registry and modifying user accounts could point towards an attempt to compromise the system, maybe by removing existing users to avoid detection or taking control.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, administrators might delete users as part of normal operations. But the frequency and the combination with PowerShell and registry changes make me think it's more likely malicious. The confidence isn't 100% because there's a possibility of false positives, but the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated use of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' with user deletion commands (e.g., 'net user \/del'), registry modifications, and 'whoami.exe' execution.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a command line entry for cmd.exe that's trying to delete a service called win32times. The command is \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting a service can be suspicious because it might be an attempt to remove something that's monitoring or protecting the system.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe, especially around registry value changes. Multiple entries show processes accessing the registry, which could indicate attempts to modify system settings or hide malicious activity. The repeated use of \"Registry value set\" might be part of configuring persistence or altering system behavior.\n\nAnother event shows a file deletion in the Temp directory: \"del %temp%\\\\tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe\". Deleting temporary files isn't always bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like after downloading or executing a payload, it could be a sign of cleanup to avoid detection.\n\nThere are also instances of \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks related to PowerShell. These might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, they could point to something more malicious. The repeated process accesses and registry changes by PowerShell and cmd.exe might suggest an attacker trying to maintain control or avoid detection.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be benign. For example, legitimate scripts might modify the registry or delete temporary files. But the combination of deleting a service, multiple registry changes, and file deletions in temp folders raises a red flag. The presence of \"win32times\" being deleted is particularly noteworthy because it's a known service name sometimes associated with malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows enough suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity related to powershell.exe. There are events like Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. Some of the files mentioned are system files like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET, so that's normal. But there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1, which is then deleted. That might be a red flag because creating and deleting temporary files could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed. The command line for some is just \"& {}\", which is an empty command, maybe a placeholder or a test. But the repetition of ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being monitored or manipulated, which isn't typical. \n\nHowever, there are also legitimate processes like whoami.exe being executed, which is a normal command to check the user. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be part of log collection, but the file path seems to be in a download directory, which might be normal if it's a user-installed tool. \n\nBut the key points here are the multiple PowerShell events, the creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and the repeated ProcessAccess events. These could be signs of something malicious, like script execution and attempts to hide activity. However, without more context, like unusual command lines or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nThe confidence isn't extremely high because some of these events could be benign, especially if the user is testing PowerShell scripts.

So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe' being created. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows utility that displays the current user's identity, so that's normal. But 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times might be a red flag. However, PowerShell is a common tool used by both legitimate processes and malware. So I need to check if there's anything suspicious about how it's being used.\n\nWait, there are multiple entries for 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' for powershell.exe. That could indicate that something is accessing the process, but without more context like parent processes or command-line arguments, it's hard to tell. The 'Process Create' events for whoami.exe are normal, but if they're being called in unexpected contexts, that might be an issue.\n\nLooking at the 'file' fields, most are 'None', but there are a couple of 'Image loaded' events pointing to 'urlmon.dll', which is a legitimate Windows DLL. However, 'urlmon.dll' is part of the Windows Internet Explorer and is used for URL monikers. If it's being loaded by unexpected processes, that could be a problem. But in this case, the processes are 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe', which are legitimate. Wait, 'calc.exe' is the calculator application, which is normal. But why is 'urlmon.dll' being loaded? Maybe there's a legitimate reason, like a web request. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing is the 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the filename is '.winlogbeat.yml.new', which sounds like a temporary file during configuration setup. That might be okay if it's part of a legitimate installation or configuration change. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events involve processes like 'svchost.exe', 'RuntimeBroker.exe', and others. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or done by unexpected processes, that could be suspicious. However, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to assess.\n\nThe 'chrome.exe' events include DNS queries and network connections. Multiple network connections from Chrome might be normal, especially if the user is browsing the internet. But if there's a lot of connections to unusual domains, that could be a sign of malicious activity. However, the logs don't mention the domains involved, so I can't tell based on this data alone.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show a mix of normal system processes and activities. There's no clear indication of malicious behavior like unexpected network traffic, unusual file access, or suspicious process creation. The repeated 'ProcessAccess' events for PowerShell might be normal if they're part of legitimate scripts or user interactions. The 'ImageLoad' events for 'urlmon.dll' are also normal in the context of legitimate applications. The 'winlogbeat' file creation seems to be a standard configuration activity.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't show any clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly routine system operations.
