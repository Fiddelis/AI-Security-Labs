{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're suspicious. Alright, first thing I notice is that most of the events are about files being created, specifically by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in a Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, and they have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. \n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that SDXHelper.exe might be related to some kind of software installation or update. But wait, Microsoft Office typically doesn't have files named with \"aicopilot\" in their directories. That doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps a malicious file?\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a common location for temporary files or packages, but usually, legitimate software would have more recognizable names. The fact that there are so many files being created with similar names and different hash-like suffixes makes me think this might be part of a larger operation. \n\nAlso, there's one event where the process is null and the task is \"Security Group Management.\" That seems out of place. Maybe a red herring, or perhaps a different type of activity. But the majority of events are the file creations.\n\nNow, considering the process name SDXHelper.exe, I should check if that's a legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Microsoft process. It might be associated with some third-party software, but if it's creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the Office directory, that's suspicious. Legitimate software usually doesn't create so many files in that location, especially with names that look like they could be part of a payload or configuration.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition. There are multiple entries for the same file being created, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js appearing twice. That could indicate that the process is attempting to write the same file multiple times, which might be an attempt to overwrite or ensure the file is present, which is common in malware behavior.\n\nAlso, the files are JavaScript files (.js), which can be used for scripting and execution. If these files are being created in a directory that's part of the Office application, they might be trying to inject code or modify the behavior of Office applications. \n\nBut wait, there's no mention of any execution events here, just file creation. However, the presence of so many files in that directory could be a sign of a dropper or a loader that's part of a larger attack. The fact that the files are named with \"aicopilot\" might be a misspelling of \"aircopilot\" or something else, but I can't be sure. \n\nAdditionally, the absence of any other processes or user activities in the logs might indicate that this is isolated activity. If this is all that's happening, it's possible that the system is being compromised, and the malicious software is setting up files for later execution. \n\nI should also consider the possibility of a legitimate software installation. However, given the unusual naming and the high number of files, it's more likely to be malicious. The lack of any other log entries related to this process or files being executed adds to the suspicion. \n\nIn conclusion, the repeated creation of multiple JavaScript files by an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe) in a non-standard location within the Microsoft Office directory is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. This warrants further investigation, such as checking the integrity of the files, examining the process's origin, and looking for any associated network activity or execution events that might confirm the presence of malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **potentially malicious activity** based on the following suspicious patterns:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated File Creation by Unusual Process**\n- **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` (not a standard Microsoft process; may be associated with third-party or malicious software).\n- **Action**: Repeated creation of JavaScript files (`.js`) in the path:  \n  `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.\n- **Significance**: \n  - The file names resemble **obfuscated or hash-based payloads** (e.g., `min_2c2b799434ae025d394cb01b9328508a.js`), which is common in malware for evasion.\n  - JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office directory are **unusual** and may indicate **code injection** or **malicious configuration**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Volume and Repetition**\n- **Number of Files**: Over **20+ unique `.js` files** created, many with **duplicate names** (e.g., `min_1444839d33dbd032e97e946723d18d56.js` appears twice).\n- **Significance**: \n  - This could indicate **file overwriting**, **payload distribution**, or **malware staging**.\n  - Legitimate software typically does not generate such a high volume of files in this location.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual File Location**\n- **Path**: `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` is a **non-standard directory** for JavaScript files.\n- **Significance**: \n  - Microsoft Office applications do not typically store `.js` files in this location.\n  - This could be an attempt to **hide malicious files** in a trusted directory.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Missing Context**\n- **No Execution Events**: Logs only show **file creation**, not execution or network activity.\n- **No User Interaction**: No evidence of user-initiated actions (e.g., downloads, installations).\n- **Significance**: \n  - This may indicate **staged malware** (files created for later execution) or **silent persistence** (e.g., a dropper or loader).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Process Name Anomalies**\n- **SDXHelper.exe**: Not a standard Windows or Microsoft process.\n- **Potential**: \n  - Could be a **dropper** (malware that deploys additional payloads).\n  - May be **impersonating a legitimate process** (e.g., a typo or mimicry of \"SDX\" tools).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the `SDXHelper.exe` process**:\n   - Check its **file path**, **digital signature**, and **parent process**.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze it.\n2. **Analyze the `.js` files**:\n   - Check for **obfuscation**, **malicious code**, or **links to external resources**.\n   - Use a **sandbox** or **static analysis tool** (e.g., VirusTotal, IDA Pro).\n3. **Monitor for execution**:\n   - Look for **PowerShell**, **WScript**, or **other scripting activity** that may execute these files.\n4. **Network Traffic**:\n   - Check for **unusual outbound connections** (e.g., to C2 servers) related to these files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs suggest **suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware staging** or **malicious software deployment**. Immediate investigation of the `SDXHelper.exe` process and the created `.js` files is warranted to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or **malicious activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this data. So, the user provided a list of system events, mostly related to file creation and a registry value set. The main process involved here is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating a bunch of JavaScript files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. There's also an entry involving chrome.exe setting a registry value.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that sometimes helper processes are part of legitimate software, but they can also be malware. The fact that it's creating a lot of .js files might be normal if it's part of some application's update or resource management. However, the repetition of certain files being created multiple times (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js appearing twice) might be a red flag. Why would the same file be created multiple times? Maybe it's a sign of something trying to overwrite or duplicate files, which isn't typical behavior for normal processes.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the same directory: C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. That seems specific. The GUID-like string in the path (8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f) might be a unique identifier for a particular package or update. If this is part of a legitimate Microsoft Office update, then it might be normal. But if not, it could be a rogue process.\n\nThe other event is from chrome.exe setting a registry value. That's a normal activity for Chrome, as it often modifies the registry for settings, extensions, or preferences. However, if there's no corresponding user action or if it's modifying unexpected keys, that could be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering the number of file creations. There are around 20 entries here, most from SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate process, maybe during an update, it's possible. However, the sheer number and the repetition might indicate something else. Malware often creates a lot of files or duplicates existing ones to hide or spread.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files. They all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash-like string. \"aicopilot\" might be a typo or a specific term. Maybe it's related to a feature or a product name, but I'm not sure. The \".min\" suggests minified JavaScript, which is common in web applications, but again, in the context of a local system, that's unusual unless it's part of some web-based application or extension.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It might be part of some third-party software, like a driver, application, or maybe even a browser extension. However, without knowing the exact software, it's hard to confirm. It could also be a malicious process masquerading as a helper.\n\nThe registry event from chrome.exe is less concerning, but it's worth noting. If there's a legitimate reason for Chrome to modify the registry, that's fine. But if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, that's another red flag.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are:\n1. Repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory.\n2. The files have similar names with hash-like strings, possibly indicating generated or obfuscated files.\n3. The absence of any obvious legitimate context for SDXHelper.exe.\n4. A single registry event from Chrome, which is normal but not necessarily indicative of a problem on its own.\n\nPossible conclusions:\n- This could be a legitimate process if SDXHelper.exe is part of a known application, especially if the files are part of an update or resource pack.\n- Alternatively, it might be malware, especially if the files are being created in a non-standard way and the process isn't recognized.\n\nTo determine the nature of SDXHelper.exe, the next steps would be:\n- Check the file's digital signature and publisher.\n- Look up the process in a malware database or using tools like VirusTotal.\n- Analyze the files created to see if they contain malicious code.\n- Check the system for any other suspicious processes or network activity.\n\nSince I can't perform these checks directly, the best I can do is present the findings and suggest further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system event logs indicate repetitive file creation by **SDXHelper.exe** and a registry modification by **chrome.exe**. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **File Creation**: Over 20 instances of file creation in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fidelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`  \n     - Files are named with a pattern like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`.  \n     - **Repetition**: Some files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_499ca2f99a6c0438b4bf6156bb7f6036.js`) appear multiple times, which is unusual for legitimate processes.  \n   - **Context**: The GUID (`8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f`) in the path may relate to a specific package or update, but its legitimacy is unclear.\n\n2. **chrome.exe Activity**:\n   - A single registry modification event is logged. This is typical for Chrome (e.g., updates, extensions), but lacks context for confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **SDXHelper.exe**:  \n  - **Unrecognized Process**: Not a standard Windows process. Could be part of third-party software or malware.  \n  - **File Behavior**: Repeated file creation and hash-based naming may indicate obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious activity.  \n  - **Directory**: The path (`Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`) suggests a potential misuse of Microsoft Office-related directories for payload storage.\n\n- **chrome.exe**:  \n  - **Normal Activity**: Registry modifications by Chrome are common but should be cross-checked with user activity (e.g., extensions, updates).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify SDXHelper.exe Legitimacy**:\n   - **Check Digital Signature**: Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **VirusTotal** to analyze the executable's publisher and signature.  \n   - **Search for Known Malware**: Look up `SDXHelper.exe` in malware databases (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX).  \n   - **File Analysis**: Inspect the created `.js` files for malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, obfuscation).\n\n2. **Investigate Chrome Activity**:\n   - Confirm if the registry modification aligns with recent Chrome updates or extensions.  \n   - Check for suspicious Chrome extensions or network activity.\n\n3. **System Scanning**:\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/malware tools (e.g., Malwarebytes, Windows Defender).  \n   - Monitor network traffic for unexpected connections.\n\n4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:\n   - Look for startup entries, scheduled tasks, or registry keys related to `SDXHelper.exe` that could indicate persistence.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe repetitive file creation by **SDXHelper.exe** and the lack of clear legitimacy for the process raise **red flags** for potential malware. While **chrome.exe** activity is normal, further investigation is critical to confirm whether **SDXHelper.exe** is malicious or part of a legitimate but obscure application. Immediate action (e.g., scanning, process analysis) is recommended to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js\". There are multiple entries, some with the same file names repeated. The user is probably asking why these files are being created, if it's normal, or if there's a security issue.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware uses similar names. Let me check. SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Windows operating system, related to the System Data Exchange (SDX) service, which handles communication between different system components. So that's a good sign it's legitimate.\n\nNext, the files being created are all in the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under \"Office\" in the user's AppData. The names suggest they're minified JavaScript files, possibly related to some application or service. Since they're being created by SDXHelper, which is a system process, maybe they're part of some caching or temporary storage.\n\nBut why so many of them? Are they being generated repeatedly? The same files are listed multiple times, which might indicate that the system is trying to create them again, perhaps due to corruption or a misconfiguration. Alternatively, it could be a normal process where the system generates these files periodically.\n\nI should also consider if these files are part of a known legitimate process. Maybe they're related to Office applications, given the \"Office\" in the path. However, the \"aicopilot\" part doesn't ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's a typo or a misinterpretation of the actual file name. Alternatively, it could be related to a third-party application that uses similar naming conventions.\n\nAnother angle: checking if these files are part of a known malware. Sometimes, malware uses system processes to create files in hidden or system directories. But since SDXHelper is a legitimate process, unless it's been compromised, the files might be safe. However, the user should verify the integrity of the SDXHelper.exe file using tools like Windows Defender or checking the file's digital signature.\n\nAlso, looking at the repetition of the same files might indicate that the system is trying to recreate them, possibly due to a conflict or a failed operation. Maybe there's an issue with the application that's generating these files, leading to repeated attempts.\n\nIn terms of security, the user should ensure that their system is up to date, as vulnerabilities in system processes can be exploited. They might also want to run a full system scan with antivirus software to rule out malware.\n\nSo, the answer should confirm that SDXHelper.exe is legitimate, explain the possible reasons for the files being created, suggest checking the legitimacy of the files, and recommend system updates and scans.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you provided indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process (a legitimate Windows system component related to the System Data Exchange service) is creating multiple **minified JavaScript files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js`) in the `OfflineFiles` directory under the user's AppData folder. Here's a breakdown of the situation and recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. What is SDXHelper.exe?**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Windows process associated with the **System Data Exchange (SDX)** service. It facilitates communication between system components, such as applications and services, and is not inherently malicious.\n- However, **malware can sometimes mimic legitimate processes** (e.g., by renaming itself to `SDXHelper.exe`). Always verify the file's **digital signature** and **location**:\n  - **Legitimate**: Located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` and signed by Microsoft.\n  - **Suspicious**: Located elsewhere (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\...`) or missing a valid digital signature.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What Are the Files Being Created?**\n- The files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js`) are **minified JavaScript files**, which are often used in web applications or software to reduce file size.\n- The **`OfflineFiles` directory** suggests these files might be part of **caching, temporary storage, or synchronization** processes for applications (e.g., Microsoft Office or third-party tools).\n- The **repetition of the same filenames** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_9a8575295259d8d88fee11e5538812be.js` appearing twice) could indicate:\n  - **Redundant generation** (e.g., due to corruption or failed operations).\n  - **Normal behavior** if the system is repeatedly accessing or regenerating these files.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Is This Behavior Normal?**\n- **Possibly.** SDXHelper.exe may generate temporary files for system or application tasks, especially during updates, synchronization, or data exchange.\n- However, **excessive file creation or duplication** could signal:\n  - **Malware activity** (e.g., if the files are not related to legitimate applications).\n  - **Application conflicts** or **corrupted system files**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Steps to Investigate Further**\n#### **A. Verify SDXHelper.exe Legitimacy**\n1. **Check the file path**:\n   - Open Task Manager → Go to the **Processes** tab → Right-click **SDXHelper.exe** → **Open file location**.\n   - If it's not in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`, this is a red flag.\n2. **Check digital signature**:\n   - Right-click the file → **Properties** → **Digital Signatures** tab → Ensure it's signed by **Microsoft Windows**.\n\n#### **B. Analyze the Files**\n1. **Inspect file contents**:\n   - Open one of the `.js` files in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) to see if it contains legitimate JavaScript code (e.g., from Microsoft Office or a known application).\n   - If the code appears obfuscated or contains suspicious strings (e.g., URLs, base64 data), it may be malicious.\n2. **Use antivirus\/malware scanners**:\n   - Run a full system scan with **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to check for threats.\n\n#### **C. Check for System Issues**\n1. **Run System File Checker**:\n   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:\n     ```\n     sfc \/scannow\n     ```\n   - This checks for and repairs corrupted system files.\n2. **Update Windows**:\n   - Ensure your system is up to date with the latest patches and updates.\n\n#### **D. Monitor System Behavior**\n- Use tools like **Process Explorer** (from Sysinternals) or **Procmon** to monitor file creation and system activity by SDXHelper.exe.\n- Look for unusual network activity, unexpected processes, or changes to the registry.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What Should You Do?**\n- **If SDXHelper.exe is legitimate** and the files are part of a known application (e.g., Office), you may not need to take action.\n- **If the files are suspicious** or the behavior is abnormal, consider:\n  - **Isolating the system** (e.g., disconnecting from networks).\n  - **Performing a full malware scan**.\n  - **Contacting Microsoft Support** or a cybersecurity professional for further analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Summary**\n- **SDXHelper.exe is legitimate**, but verify its file path and signature.\n- The generated files may be part of normal system\/application behavior, but **repetition or suspicious content** warrants further investigation.\n- **Stay vigilant** and ensure your system is secure with up-to-date antivirus and system updates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help analyzing specific files or logs!"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're suspicious. So, first, I'll look through the entries.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. That seems odd because those are JavaScript files, and they're being created in a Microsoft Office folder. Maybe that's normal? Or maybe not. Also, there are a lot of them—like 14 entries of SDXHelper creating these JS files. That's a lot of files being created in a short time, which might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's one entry where chrome.exe sets a registry value. That's a different process, but registry changes can be suspicious if they're modifying key settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office. That's a common place for legitimate software too, but the fact that so many files are being created there by SDXHelper might indicate something's wrong. Also, the filenames have \"min\" which might stand for minified, but that's common in web dev. However, why would a local process be creating so many minified JS files in Office's directory?\n\nAnother thing is that the same file is created twice with the same name (officeaicopilot-strings.min_e8258ccc...js). Maybe that's a duplicate entry in the logs, or maybe the process tried to create it twice. Either way, it's unusual.\n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a well-known process. I should check if that's a legitimate Microsoft process. Wait, I don't recall SDXHelper being part of Office. Maybe it's a third-party app or malware. If it's not a standard process, that's a concern.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple file creations by the same process in the same directory could be part of a larger attack, like dropping payloads or preparing for something else. The registry change by Chrome might be unrelated, but it's worth noting.\n\nSo, putting this together: a non-standard process creating numerous files in a sensitive directory, possibly with malicious intent. The high number of files and the unusual filenames might indicate malicious activity. However, without more context or checking if SDXHelper is legitimate, it's hard to be certain. But given the information, it's suspicious enough to flag for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Volume:** 14 entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) in the Microsoft Office directory (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`). This is highly unusual for legitimate Office processes.\n   - **File Naming:** The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) suggest minified JavaScript, which is typical for web applications but not for local Office operations. This could indicate malicious payload delivery or obfuscation.\n   - **Duplicate Entries:** The same file (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_e8258ccc...js`) is created twice, possibly indicating errors or repeated attempts.\n\n2. **Non-Standard Process (`SDXHelper.exe`):**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a recognized Microsoft Office component. Its presence and activity in Office directories raise concerns about potential malware or unauthorized software.\n\n3. **Registry Modification by `chrome.exe`:**\n   - While not inherently malicious, a registry change by Chrome could be part of a broader attack (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering). However, this requires further context to assess risk.\n\n### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n- **Unusual Process Activity:** `SDXHelper.exe` creating numerous files in sensitive directories.\n- **Suspicious File Types:** JavaScript files in non-web contexts (e.g., Office directories).\n- **Repetitive File Creation:** Duplicates or excessive file generation in a short timeframe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Verify Legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`:** Check if the process is signed by a trusted publisher and investigate its origin.\n- **Analyze Files:** Examine the contents of the created `.min.js` files for malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, embedded payloads).\n- **Monitor Registry Changes:** Investigate the registry modification by Chrome for signs of tampering or persistence.\n- **Network and Behavior Analysis:** Check for network activity or other anomalous behavior by `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs suggest **potential malicious activity** by an unknown process (`SDXHelper.exe`) creating suspicious files in a sensitive directory. Further analysis is required to confirm whether this is a false positive, benign activity, or a security threat. **Flag for investigation** and consider isolating the affected system until the source is identified."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate system file, so probably nothing wrong there. Then there's SDXHelper.exe creating several JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. Hmm, SDXHelper.exe isn't a common process name. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. Maybe part of Microsoft Office? But creating multiple JS files in a specific path might be normal for some updates or packages. However, the repetition of similar file names with different hashes could be a red flag. Are those files expected, or is this a sign of malicious activity?\n\nNext, chrome.exe loading Windows Defender DLLs like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate, so that's normal. Then, multiple registry value set events from chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be suspicious, but again, Chrome might do that for updates or settings. However, if it's done in a way that's not typical, that's a concern.\n\nLooking at the file creations: the user downloaded an Excel file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and there are multiple entries about creating streams and Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is a Windows feature that marks files as downloaded, so that's normal. But the repeated creation of streams might be part of normal operations, unless there's an unusual amount of activity.\n\nNow, the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JS files with different hashes in the Office package directory. If those files are part of a legitimate update, that's okay. But if they're being created in a way that's unexpected, maybe it's a sign of something malicious. However, the paths mentioned are within the Office SolutionPackages folder, which might be a place where such files are stored during installation or updates.\n\nAnother thing to note: the same file creation events for the JS files are repeated multiple times. That could indicate that the process is creating multiple copies, which might be a sign of persistence or data exfiltration. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying critical keys, that's a problem.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. It might be part of some third-party software or a potential malware. If that's the case, creating those JS files could be part of a malicious payload. However, without more information, it's hard to confirm.\n\nPutting it all together: the main points of concern are the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories and the registry changes by chrome.exe. However, some of these activities could be normal depending on the context. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, the presence of non-standard processes and repeated file operations might warrant further examination. But I need to make sure not to jump to conclusions without more data. Maybe the user is using a tool that's generating these logs, and SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application. Alternatively, it could be a sign of a security threat. So, the answer should flag these as potential areas for further investigation but note that more context is needed to determine if it's malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of legitimate system activity and potential indicators of interest that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Potential Concerns**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity**:\n   - **Legitimate Context**: The JavaScript (`*.js`) files created in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory may be part of updates, add-ins, or localization files for Office applications. However, the **repetition of similar filenames with varying hashes** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) raises questions about whether these files are expected or if they could be malicious payloads (e.g., obfuscated scripts).\n   - **Unusual Process**: **SDXHelper.exe** is not a standard Windows or Microsoft process. While it may be associated with third-party software or legitimate tools, its presence and repetitive file-creation behavior merit closer scrutiny (e.g., checking if it's signed, its origin, and whether it's listed in trusted repositories).\n\n2. **Chrome.exe and Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Legitimate Context**: Chrome frequently modifies registry keys for updates, extensions, or user preferences. However, **multiple \"Registry value set\" events** without clear context (e.g., specific keys modified) could indicate tampering or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n3. **File Stream Creation and Zone.Identifier**:\n   - The repeated creation of streams for the downloaded Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and its `Zone.Identifier` (a Windows marker for downloaded files) appears **normal for file handling**. However, the **frequency of these events** (e.g., multiple entries for the same file) could signal unusual behavior (e.g., data exfiltration or tampering).\n\n4. **Repeated Loading of `urlmon.dll`**:\n   - `urlmon.dll` (part of Internet Explorer\/Windows) is a legitimate system component. Its repeated loading by Chrome is likely unrelated to malicious activity but could be a red herring.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Check SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Verify the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (if present) and cross-reference it with trusted sources.\n   - Analyze the **file contents** of the JavaScript files created (e.g., using a sandbox or static analysis) to determine if they contain malicious code or benign resources.\n\n2. **Monitor Registry Changes**:\n   - Investigate the **specific registry keys** modified by Chrome.exe to ensure they align with expected behavior (e.g., no unexpected changes to system-critical keys).\n\n3. **Correlate with Network Activity**:\n   - Check if the Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) or the JavaScript files are communicating with external IPs or domains, which could indicate data exfiltration or C2 activity.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Determine if the user has recently installed new software or updates that might involve `SDXHelper.exe` or the Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Chrome.exe loading system DLLs, Zone.Identifier creation) is normal, the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe** and **unusual process name** raise **low-to-moderate risk flags**. This log merits further investigation to rule out malicious activity, especially if the system is part of a sensitive environment. **Not a high-priority alert** but worth monitoring."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll scan through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path seems a bit unusual. Office usually doesn't generate JavaScript files in those locations, especially with such long, seemingly random filenames. Maybe part of a malicious payload?\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't inherently bad. But the repetition might be normal for Excel's operations. However, I should check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nAnother event shows EXCEL.EXE creating a file in the Downloads directory with a ~$ prefix. That's a common temporary file created by Excel when editing documents, so that's probably normal. Not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event for EXCEL.EXE. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's an unusual number or unexpected usage, it could be a red flag. However, with just one event, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe events again. It's creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames have language codes (af-za, am-et, ar-sa, as-in) followed by ui-strings-json. That seems like localization files, but why would SDXHelper.exe be creating them? Office might use such files, but the presence of multiple files with different language codes in a user's AppData might be suspicious. Could be part of a malicious package or an exploit.\n\nAlso, the process names: SDXHelper.exe and HxTsr.exe. I don't recognize HxTsr.exe as a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a third-party application, but if it's not known, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that it's modifying the registry (Registry value set) might be concerning if it's not a known legitimate process.\n\nThe other events involve svchost.exe modifying the registry. That's normal because svchost hosts various system services, so registry changes here are expected.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in unusual locations, possibly related to Office, and the presence of HxTsr.exe which isn't a known process. The repeated ImageLoad events for legitimate DLLs might not be suspicious on their own. However, the combination of these events could indicate that SDXHelper.exe is part of a malicious package or an exploit, especially if those JavaScript files are being used to deliver malware or perform some malicious activity.\n\nI should also consider if these files are part of a legitimate Office update or add-in. But given the filenames and the locations, it's more likely to be something malicious. Additionally, the fact that multiple files are being created with different language codes might be an attempt to bypass detection by varying the content.\n\nSo, the key indicators here are the unusual file creation by SDXHelper.exe and the unknown process HxTsr.exe modifying the registry. These would warrant further investigation, such as checking the files' contents, verifying the processes' legitimacy, and looking for other related events that might not be in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious indicators that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Activity:**\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Multiple JavaScript files (`*.js`) are created in the **Office `SolutionPackages` directory** under the user's AppData folder. The filenames include language-specific codes (e.g., `af-za`, `ar-sa`) and \"ui-strings-json,\" which may indicate **localization files**. However, the presence of such files in this context is **unusual**, as Office typically does not generate JavaScript files here. This could suggest **malicious activity**, such as **payload delivery** or **exploitation** via Office-related processes.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process `HxTsr.exe`:**\n   - The process `HxTsr.exe` is involved in **registry modifications** (`Registry value set`). This process is **not a standard Windows or Office component**, and its name does not match known legitimate software. This raises concerns about **unknown or potentially malicious software** interacting with the system.\n\n3. **Repeated `FileCreate` Events for `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - The repeated creation of `.js` files in the `SolutionPackages` folder (with varying language codes) may indicate **attempts to bypass detection** by generating multiple variants of malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **Less Suspicious but Noteworthy:**\n- **Legitimate DLL Loads by `EXCEL.EXE`:**  \n  The loading of system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `amsi.dll`) is **normal for Excel** during document processing. These are not inherently suspicious.\n- **`svchost.exe` Registry Modifications:**  \n  These are **expected** as `svchost` hosts system services and may legitimately modify the registry.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events **strongly suggest a potential security incident**. The **unusual file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** and the **unknown process `HxTsr.exe`** modifying the registry are **high-priority indicators of compromise**. Further investigation is required, including:\n- Analyzing the contents of the created `.js` files.\n- Verifying the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` and `HxTsr.exe`.\n- Checking for additional malicious activity not captured in this log batch.\n\n**Recommendation:** Investigate these events immediately, isolate affected systems if necessary, and consider endpoint detection\/response (EDR) tools to trace the origin of these activities."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for any patterns or anomalies that might indicate malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to EXCEL.EXE creating files. Specifically, there are two instances where EXCEL.EXE creates a file stream with the path ending in \"Zone.Identifier\". Zone.Identifier is typically used by Windows to mark files as coming from the internet, which is a security feature. But creating such a stream might be part of a malicious attempt to bypass security measures, like when a file is downloaded and then modified to remove the zone identifier, making it appear local. However, in this case, the file is being created, not modified. But maybe that's part of the process.\n\nThen there's the creation of various JavaScript files under the Office SolutionPackages directory by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, but creating multiple files with different language codes might be normal for updates or installations. However, the repetition of some files (like the bg-bg-ui-strings-json file appearing twice) might be a red flag. Also, the presence of multiple files with different language codes could be part of a legitimate update, but it's worth checking if they're expected.\n\nAnother point is the creation of a .LNK file in the Recent folder by EXCEL.EXE. Shortcut files can sometimes be used in attacks to execute malicious code when opened. However, just creating a shortcut isn't necessarily malicious unless it's pointing to a harmful location. The log doesn't show the target of the shortcut, so that's a bit of a blind spot here.\n\nThere are also several Registry value set events by EXCEL.EXE. Changing registry values can be a sign of malware trying to modify system settings. However, Excel might legitimately modify registry entries for its own configuration. The problem is that there are so many of these events, which could indicate excessive or unusual activity. If Excel is modifying multiple registry keys, that might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: EXCEL.EXE and Explorer.EXE are standard, but SDXHelper.exe is part of Office. The repetition of events and the number of registry changes might be more concerning. Also, the Zone.Identifier files could be part of an attempt to manipulate file origins, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that some of these events could be normal. For example, when Excel creates a shortcut in the Recent folder, it's part of normal operation. Similarly, SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific files might be part of an update. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities, like the Zone.Identifier streams and numerous registry changes, might indicate something more sinister.\n\nI should also check if there's any other context missing, like the user's environment or other logs. But based solely on these events, the presence of multiple potential red flags, even if some are normal, might warrant further investigation. The key is whether these activities are out of the ordinary for the user's system. Since I don't have that context, the logs themselves show enough anomalies to be considered interesting for a security investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several indicators that warrant further investigation, though none are definitively malicious on their own. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Zone.Identifier Streams Created by `EXCEL.EXE`**  \n   - **Observation**: Two entries show `EXCEL.EXE` creating files ending with `.xlsx Zone.Identifier` (e.g., `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx.LNK`).  \n   - **Implication**: Zone.Identifier streams are used by Windows to track file origins (e.g., \"downloaded from the internet\"). While normal, **creating** such streams could indicate an attempt to manipulate file attributes or bypass security restrictions (e.g., if a malicious file is marked as \"local\" by modifying these streams). This requires deeper context (e.g., file contents, user intent).\n\n2. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.EXE`**  \n   - **Observation**: Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js`) are created under `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` by `SDXHelper.EXE`. Some files are duplicated (e.g., `bg-bg-ui-strings-json` appears twice).  \n   - **Implication**: While `SDXHelper.EXE` is a legitimate Office process, **repetitive or unexpected file creation** in this directory could indicate an update, installation, or potential tampering. The duplication of files may suggest anomalies in the update process.\n\n3. **Excessive Registry Modifications by `EXCEL.EXE`**  \n   - **Observation**: Nine entries show `EXCEL.EXE` setting registry values (e.g., `Registry value set` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`).  \n   - **Implication**: While Excel may legitimately modify registry keys, **multiple simultaneous changes** could indicate tampering (e.g., configuring proxy settings, disabling security features, or modifying startup behavior). This requires correlation with known legitimate Excel registry activity.\n\n4. **Shortcut File Creation in `Recent` Folder**  \n   - **Observation**: `EXCEL.EXE` creates a `.LNK` file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx.LNK`) in `AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent`.  \n   - **Implication**: Shortcut files can be used to execute malicious payloads if they point to harmful locations. However, the target of the shortcut is not logged here, so further analysis (e.g., inspecting the shortcut's properties) is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate**:  \n  - `SDXHelper.EXE` creating language-specific files (e.g., `bundle_1fe8fdf08a76d34524f5d50f471c45e8.js`) could be part of an Office update or localization process.  \n  - `EXCEL.EXE` creating shortcuts in the `Recent` folder is normal behavior for tracking recently opened files.  \n\n- **Suspicious**:  \n  - **Repetition of identical files** (e.g., `bg-bg-ui-strings-json`) and **excessive registry modifications** by `EXCEL.EXE` are atypical and may indicate tampering.  \n  - The **Zone.Identifier stream creation** is unusual unless tied to a known legitimate use case (e.g., file import\/export).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Inspect File Contents**:  \n   - Analyze the `.LNK` file and JavaScript files for malicious payloads (e.g., embedded scripts, URLs pointing to phishing sites, or obfuscated code).  \n\n2. **Correlate with Registry Changes**:  \n   - Review the specific registry keys modified by `EXCEL.EXE` to determine if they align with known legitimate behavior (e.g., `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office`).\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in SDXHelper.EXE Activity**:  \n   - Investigate whether the files created by `SDXHelper.EXE` are part of a legitimate Office update or if they match signatures of known malware.\n\n4. **Monitor User Behavior**:  \n   - Determine if the user interacted with suspicious files or URLs around the time of these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., shortcut creation) is normal, the combination of **repetitive file creation**, **excessive registry modifications**, and **unusual Zone.Identifier handling** raises red flags. These events merit further investigation to rule out tampering or malware activity. **No definitive malicious activity is confirmed**, but the anomalies justify closer scrutiny."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the data.\n\nFirst, most of the entries are about EXCEL.EXE performing registry value sets. There are like 13 entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set\". Then, there are a few entries involving SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific directories under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like they could be part of an Office add-in or something similar, with hashes in the filenames. \n\nNow, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry a lot, but maybe in some cases, like when adding macros or customizations, it could. However, 13 instances of registry changes might be a red flag. But then, the SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in those directories—Office SolutionPackages are typically used for add-ins, so maybe this is related to installing or updating an add-in. However, the filenames have unique hashes, which might indicate custom or possibly malicious content. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the files are in OfflineFiles. Office add-ins can have offline resources, so maybe that's normal. However, the combination of multiple file creations and registry changes by Excel might be suspicious. But I need to check if there's any indication of malicious activity. \n\nLooking at the processes, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Office, I think. But creating multiple files with those names could be part of a legitimate add-in installation. However, the repetition of the same file paths being created multiple times might be a sign of something wrong. Also, the registry changes by Excel might be part of a legitimate process, but if they're all the same or related to a specific action, it might not be. \n\nHmm, but there's no mention of any network activity, user anomalies, or other suspicious processes. The main points are the registry changes and file creations. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I should consider whether these activities are out of the ordinary. \n\nIf these actions are part of a known legitimate process, then maybe not. But if there's no prior context, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in unusual directories could be worth looking into. However, since SDXHelper is a legitimate process and the files are in expected locations for Office add-ins, it might not be malicious. \n\nAlternatively, the high number of registry changes might indicate something like a script or macro that's modifying the registry extensively, which could be a sign of a compromise. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified or any other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's some activity that could be normal for Office add-ins, the volume of registry changes and the pattern of file creation might warrant further investigation to confirm if it's legitimate or a potential security issue.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate a mix of activities that could be either legitimate or warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Excel.EXE Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequency:** 13 instances of `Registry value set` operations by `EXCEL.EXE`.\n   - **Implication:** While Excel can modify the registry (e.g., for add-ins or macros), such a high volume of changes may indicate an unusual process, such as a malicious macro or unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n2. **SDXHelper.EXE File Creations:**\n   - **Location:** Files are created in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`, a directory typically used for **Office add-ins** (e.g., `.manifest` files, resources for task panes).\n   - **File Names:** Filenames include hashes (e.g., `taskpane_e0bdd6190d96fa9514e08006ef2230b9.js`) and language-specific strings (e.g., `ca-es-ui-strings-json_8a5d9360ed05e2bffd37c8a743a3e686.js`), which could be **legitimate add-in resources** or **malicious payloads** disguised as language packs.\n   - **Repetition:** Multiple entries for the same file paths suggest repeated operations, which could indicate **installing\/updating an add-in** or **suspicious persistence mechanisms**.\n\n3. **Process Context:**\n   - **SDXHelper.EXE:** A legitimate process associated with **Microsoft Office**, often involved in add-in deployment. However, its activity here is tied to file creation in non-standard subdirectories (e.g., `OfflineFiles`), which may be unusual.\n   - **Excel.EXE:** Typically not responsible for registry modifications unless interacting with macros or external scripts.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual Volume of Registry Changes:** 13 `Registry value set` operations by Excel may indicate **unauthorized configuration changes** or **macro-driven activity**.\n- **File Creation Patterns:** The use of hashes in filenames and repeated creation of files in `OfflineFiles` could suggest **custom or obfuscated add-ins**, possibly **malicious** if not part of a known, whitelisted package.\n- **Lack of Context:** No evidence of network activity, user anomalies, or other processes (e.g., PowerShell, WMI) that might indicate compromise.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for Legitimate Add-ins:**\n   - Verify if the files in `SolutionPackages` correspond to **approved Office add-ins**. If not, investigate further.\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes:**\n   - Audit the specific registry keys modified by Excel to determine if they align with **known legitimate operations** or indicate **unauthorized changes**.\n3. **Monitor SDXHelper.EXE:**\n   - Ensure the process is behaving as expected. Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **SIEM** to correlate file creation with user actions or external triggers.\n4. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n   - Scan the created files for malware signatures or compare hashes against threat intelligence databases.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity is **potentially legitimate** (e.g., installing an Office add-in) but **requires further investigation** due to the volume of registry changes and the obfuscated nature of the files. If the add-in is untrusted or the user did not initiate the changes, this could indicate a **compromise**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these log entries. So, the user provided a bunch of file creation events. Most of them are from SDXHelper.exe, which I think is related to Microsoft Office, maybe part of some add-in or helper process. The files being created are all .js files in the SolutionPackages directory under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like \"da-dk-ui-strings-json_...\" which probably stands for Danish (Denmark) UI strings. \n\nWait, but then there's one entry from winlogbeat.exe, which is a Beats component used for shipping logs. The file it created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. That seems like a normal operation when configuring Winlogbeat, maybe creating a new configuration file. But the rest are all from SDXHelper.exe.\n\nNow, the question is whether these events are suspicious. Normally, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but if there's a lot of file creation in unexpected locations or with unusual filenames, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the files are in the expected Office SolutionPackages directory, and the names make sense for localized UI resources. \n\nBut wait, there's a lot of them. The user has multiple entries for different languages. That might be part of a legitimate update or installation of Office language packs. However, if this is happening unexpectedly or without user initiation, it could be something else. Also, the fact that there's a mix of SDXHelper and Winlogbeat might be normal if the user is setting up monitoring, but the SDXHelper part seems okay.\n\nI should check if creating so many .js files in that directory is typical. Maybe during an Office update, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the files are being generated by a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper.exe. However, without more context like the process's PID, parent process, or other indicators, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the absence of other suspicious activities, like network connections to unknown IPs or other process anomalies, these file creations might be legitimate. But the sheer number of files could be worth investigating further. Maybe the user should check the integrity of the SDXHelper.exe process, ensure it's not a malware dropper. Also, check if the files are actually UI string resources or something else. \n\nSo, the answer would be that while the events themselves don't immediately look malicious, the volume and the fact that they're all from SDXHelper.exe might warrant further investigation to confirm they're legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries consist of multiple **file creation events** primarily from `SDXHelper.exe` and one from `winlogbeat.exe`. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity:**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe`** are known, legitimate processes:\n  - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is associated with **Microsoft Office** (e.g., part of the Office suite's helper processes for add-ins, updates, or language packs).\n  - **`winlogbeat.exe`** is a **Beats component** used for log collection and shipping (common in monitoring setups).\n\n- **File paths and content**:\n  - The `.js` files created by `SDXHelper.exe` are located in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. These files appear to be **language-specific UI string resources** (e.g., `da-dk-ui-strings-json_...` for Danish, `fr-ca-ui-strings-json_...` for French (Canada), etc.).\n  - The file created by `winlogbeat.exe` (`winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`) is a **configuration file** for Winlogbeat, which is typical during setup or configuration changes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Red Flags:**\n- **Volume of activity**: While creating localized UI resources is normal during Office updates or installations, the **high number of files** (e.g., 15+ entries for different languages) may indicate:\n  - A **massive Office update** or **language pack deployment**.\n  - **Unusual behavior** if the user did not initiate an Office update or if the files are being generated in an unexpected context.\n\n- **No obvious malicious indicators**:\n  - No suspicious file types (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`, or obfuscated names).\n  - No network activity, process anomalies, or privilege escalation mentioned in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendations for Further Investigation**:\n- **Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n  - Check the **file signature** (e.g., via `sigcheck` or PowerShell: `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`).\n  - Ensure the process is **not a dropper** (e.g., check for unexpected child processes or memory dumps).\n\n- **Monitor for unusual behavior**:\n  - If these events occur **outside the expected context** (e.g., during normal Office usage), investigate for **unauthorized updates** or **malware masquerading as legitimate processes**.\n\n- **Check Winlogbeat logs**:\n  - Confirm that the `.yml.new` file is part of a **legitimate configuration change** and not a **malicious tampering attempt**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **likely legitimate**, as they align with expected behavior for Office updates and Winlogbeat configuration. However, the **high volume of file creations** warrants further scrutiny to ensure:\n- No **unauthorized activity** is occurring under the guise of `SDXHelper.exe`.\n- The **Office environment** is not compromised or being used for malicious purposes.\n\nIf no additional suspicious indicators are found, the activity can be considered **normal**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like hu-hu-ui-strings-json, en-us_web-fabric.js, and others with different language codes. These look like resource files for different locales. The paths are all within the user's AppData folder under Office, which might be part of a normal installation or update process. However, the repetition of some files, like the icon_built_in_svg_icon.js appearing twice, might be a red flag. But maybe that's just a duplicate entry in the logs.\n\nThen there are some registry events and DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be normal, but combined with other activities, they might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The DNS query from EXCEL.EXE could be part of normal operations, like checking for updates or connecting to a server.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, especially when dealing with add-ins or solutions. If it's creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder, that might be part of deploying or updating add-ins. However, if these files are being created in an unusual manner or from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. But in this case, the logs don't show any anomalies in the process's behavior beyond the file creation.\n\nThe key thing here is that all the activities seem to be related to Office's normal operations. The file names and paths are consistent with what you'd expect during an update or installation. There's no indication of malware or unauthorized access. The registry events are from legitimate processes, and the DNS query is from EXCEL.EXE, which is a standard application.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of file creation events might be a bit high. But again, if this is part of a large update or deployment, it's normal. Without seeing any error messages, unexpected network activity, or other suspicious processes, it's hard to flag this as malicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together, these events don't appear to be anything unusual. They align with typical Office operations. Therefore, the batch of events is not interesting for investigation unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not indicate any suspicious or noteworthy activity requiring further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating `.js` files in the `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directory. These files appear to be locale-specific resource files (e.g., `hu-hu-ui-strings-json`, `it-it-ui-strings-json`).\n   - **Context:** This behavior aligns with normal operations during Office add-in deployments or updates. The file paths and naming conventions are consistent with legitimate Microsoft Office processes.\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - `EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe` show registry modifications and a DNS query. These are typical for applications interacting with system settings or network resources (e.g., updates, licensing, or connectivity checks).\n   - **No anomalies:** No evidence of unauthorized registry changes or suspicious DNS requests (e.g., to malicious domains).\n\n3. **Duplicates and Repetition:**\n   - Some files (e.g., `icon_built_in_svg_icon.js`) are logged multiple times. This may reflect redundant logging or normal file creation during deployment but does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are consistent with **legitimate Office operations**, such as add-in installations, updates, or resource management. No indicators of compromise (e.g., unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or unauthorized access) are present. **No further investigation is warranted** unless additional context (e.g., unexpected behavior from `SDXHelper.exe`, unexplained network traffic) is available. \n\n**Final Verdict:** ❌ **Not Interesting for Investigation** (normal Office activity)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is that I have to analyze the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" and no file information. There are 19 of these. But then there are a few events from SDXHelper.exe related to file creation in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like they might be part of a package or resource files, maybe for localization since there are language codes in the filenames (like kok-in, lb-lu, lv-lv, mi-nz).\n\nNow, the key here is to see if there's any suspicious activity. The repeated registry changes by EXCEL.EXE could be normal if Excel is modifying its own settings, but if it's doing this excessively, maybe that's an indicator. However, the SDXHelper.exe creating files in those directories—SDXHelper sounds like a legitimate Microsoft process, possibly related to Office add-ins or solutions. But the filenames are a bit generic. However, the fact that these files are being created in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal during the installation or update of an Office add-on.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many registry events from Excel? If Excel is modifying registry values repeatedly, that might not be typical. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. The presence of both registry changes and file creations could be part of a legitimate process, like installing a new feature or updating software. However, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creations by different processes might be worth looking into. \n\nBut the SDXHelper.exe files are in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a known location for Office add-ins. The filenames include things like \"transcription-strings.min.js\" and \"taskpane.js,\" which could be part of a legitimate add-in's resources. However, the lack of any other events that might indicate malicious activity (like network connections, unusual process behavior, etc.) makes it less likely to be a security threat. \n\nOn the other hand, the high number of registry events from Excel might be a red flag. But if Excel is being used in a way that requires many registry modifications, maybe it's just a normal operation. Without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nConsidering that the majority of events are from Excel modifying the registry, but the SDXHelper.exe events are creating files in a legitimate directory, I think the batch might not be interesting. However, the sheer number of registry events could be a sign of something unusual. But since there's no clear malicious activity indicated, and the SDXHelper events are in a known location, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. The justification would be that the events are related to legitimate Office processes, even though the volume of registry changes is notable but not necessarily malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs consist of two distinct patterns: **repeated registry modifications by `EXCEL.EXE`** and **file creation events by `SDXHelper.exe`** in Microsoft Office-related directories. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **`EXCEL.EXE` Registry Activity**:\n   - **Volume**: 19 events of \"Registry value set\" by `EXCEL.EXE`, all with no file context.\n   - **Likelihood**: While excessive registry modifications can sometimes indicate malicious behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms), this alone is not conclusive. Excel may legitimately modify registry keys during normal operations (e.g., configuration changes, add-in interactions).\n\n2. **`SDXHelper.exe` File Creation**:\n   - **Location**: Files are created in `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages` directories, a known location for Office add-ins and resources.\n   - **File Names**: Filenames like `transcription-strings.min.js`, `taskpane.js`, and language-specific `.json` files suggest they are part of a **localized add-in or resource package** (e.g., for UI strings or features).\n   - **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft process associated with Office solutions, though its exact role may depend on the installed add-ins.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **No Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: No suspicious network activity, anomalous process behavior, or unusual file content is mentioned in the logs.\n- **Contextual Legitimacy**: Both processes (`EXCEL.EXE` and `SDXHelper.exe`) are associated with Microsoft Office, and the file paths\/activities align with typical Office add-in behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**NOT INTERESTING**  \nThe events appear to be **legitimate and contextually normal** for an Office environment. The registry modifications by `EXCEL.EXE` and file creations by `SDXHelper.exe` are consistent with software updates, add-in deployments, or localization tasks. While the volume of registry changes is notable, no clear malicious activity is indicated.\n\n**Confidence**: Moderate (no definitive malicious signals, but further context could clarify the purpose of the registry changes)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. The first thing that comes to mind is that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, so creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal. However, I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a common location for Office add-ins or solutions. The filenames are like mk-mk-ui-strings-json with hashes. The repetition of some files, like the one with mr-in-ui-strings-json appearing twice, might be a red flag. But maybe it's just a duplicate entry in the logs.\n\nWait, the process is SDXHelper.exe. I recall that this process is used by Office for managing solution packages. So creating these files could be part of installing or updating an add-in. However, if these files are being created in a user's AppData folder, it's usually not a problem. But if they were created in system directories or if the process is not legitimate, that would be a concern.\n\nAnother point is the naming. The filenames include language codes (like mk-mk, ml-in, mr-in, nb-no) which are valid language codes. The hashes in the filenames might be checksums or unique identifiers for the package. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names might indicate an attempt to install multiple language packs, which could be normal. Alternatively, if the files are not expected, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nBut considering the process is SDXHelper.exe and the location is within the Office SolutionPackages directory, this seems like a legitimate activity. Unless there's an unusual number of files or other indicators of compromise in the logs, which I don't see here. The fact that the same file is logged twice might be a duplicate log entry, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nHmm, but why would the same file be created twice? Maybe the process tried to create it twice, which could be an error. However, without more context, like other events or processes involved, it's hard to say. The classification here depends on whether this behavior is normal for SDXHelper.exe. Since the user is asking if the batch is interesting, and given that all events are from a legitimate process in a legitimate location, maybe it's not interesting. But I should check if there's any known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I know, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate file, so this might just be normal operations. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific JavaScript files in the expected Office SolutionPackages directory. The process and location are legitimate for Microsoft Office add-in operations, with no signs of anomalous behavior or malicious indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
