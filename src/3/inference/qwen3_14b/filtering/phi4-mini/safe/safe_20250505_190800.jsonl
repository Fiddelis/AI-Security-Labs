The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: mmc.exe triggering a registry value set. That's a normal process, part of the Microsoft Management Console. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being created multiple times. PowerShell is common, but the command lines and tasks might indicate something. The second entry shows Process Create with the full path, which is normal. But then there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them is standard when running .NET applications via PowerShell. However, the repetition might be normal, but I need to check for anomalies.\n\nNext, there's a File created event for a temporary script file __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1, then it's deleted. That's odd. Creating and deleting a script file in the Temp directory could be part of a script execution, but if it's followed by deletion, maybe it's an attempt to hide evidence. However, the file is named with a random string, which might be normal for temporary files.\n\nAnother File created event for teste.ps1 in Downloads. Then, a Process Create event with ExecutionPolicy Bypass and running that script. Bypassing execution policy is a red flag because it allows scripts to run without being signed or approved. That's a common tactic in attacks to execute malicious scripts.\n\nThen, there's a Process accessed event, which might be normal, but the repeated Image Loads of the same DLLs again could be part of the script execution. Also, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be related to configuration changes, but that's not necessarily malicious unless there's an unusual command line or unauthorized access.\n\nPutting it all together: The key points are the use of -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which is a high-risk indicator. Creating and then deleting a script file in Temp, followed by running another script from Downloads. The repeated loading of .NET DLLs is normal for PowerShell scripts using .NET, but combined with the bypassed execution policy, this could indicate an attempt to run a script that's not trusted. The fact that the user is running a script with Bypass might be a sign of a compromised system or an insider trying to execute scripts without proper permissions.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other signs. The file in the Temp directory is deleted after creation, which could be a red herring, but the execution of the script from Downloads is more concerning. The presence of multiple Image Loads might be normal, but the combination with the Bypass flag and the script execution is suspicious.\n\nConfidence-wise, this isn't a clear-cut attack, but the indicators are enough to warrant further investigation. The classification should be INTERESTING because the use of ExecutionPolicy Bypass and the script execution are potential signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious activities: execution policy bypass, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET DLLs which may indicate script-based attacks or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided three log entries. Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst event: PowerShell created a file in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a script test. The file path ends with .ps1, which is a PowerShell script. The task is \"File created\" under the FileCreate rule. That's normal for temporary files, maybe part of a test.\n\nSecond event: The same PowerShell process deleted that same Temp file. Task is FileDeleteDetected. So the file was created and then immediately deleted. That's a bit odd. Why create and delete a script so quickly? Could be a cleanup, but sometimes malicious scripts do that to hide their presence.\n\nThird event: PowerShell created another file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This is a known directory for PowerShell profiles. Creating a file here might be part of setting up a persistent profile, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, if it's a legitimate user action, it's normal.\n\nPutting it all together: The first two events involve a temporary script being created and deleted. The third is a file in a profile directory. The deletion might be part of a test, but the combination of creating and deleting a script in Temp, plus creating a profile file, could indicate someone trying to test or set up persistence. However, without more context like the script's content or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. The confidence isn't extremely high, but there's enough to consider it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A PowerShell process created and immediately deleted a temporary script file (.__PSScriptPolicyTest_...), which is often seen in malicious activity to avoid detection. Additionally, a file was created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData directory, which could indicate attempts to establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
