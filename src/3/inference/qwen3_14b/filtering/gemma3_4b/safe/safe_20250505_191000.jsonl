{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, right? But why is SDXHelper.exe loading them? Hmm, maybe that's normal. But then I see that the same process is loading those DLLs multiple times. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an event with rundll32.exe executing a command involving shell32.dll and a GUID. That GUID looks a bit odd. Usually, rundll32 is used for legitimate purposes, but sometimes malware uses it. The command line has -Embedding, which is common in some exploits. That might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and Registry value set events. Those are normal for system processes, but if there's a lot of them, maybe something's up. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. That's a log file, probably part of monitoring, so not suspicious.\n\nThen EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But why is Excel loading so many DLLs? Maybe just part of normal operation. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for the same process might be normal, but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nWait, the GUID in the rundll32 command line: {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6}. I should check if that's a known legitimate GUID. If it's not, that could be a sign of something malicious. But I don't recognize it off the top of my head. Also, the command line is a bit long and has -Embedding, which is sometimes used in malicious contexts.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated User Account Management events. But those are probably just normal user activity. The logon events from services.exe and others are standard.\n\nPutting this all together: the main suspicious point is the rundll32.exe command with that GUID. It's not immediately obvious if it's malicious, but the presence of such a command line with unusual parameters might warrant further investigation. The other events don't seem to point to anything obviously malicious. However, since the rundll32 event is a known vector for attacks, this might be enough to classify the batch as interesting. The confidence isn't super high, but there's enough to flag it for closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple 'Image loaded' events for SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll), which may indicate legitimate behavior but warrants scrutiny. Additionally, a suspicious rundll32.exe command line with an unusual GUID and '-Embedding' parameter raises potential malicious activity concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first five entries are all about \"User Account Management\" in the winlog task, but there's no process or file information. Those might be normal administrative activities, but without more context, they might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, looking at the sixth event: Excel.exe loaded a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32\\coml2.dll. Wait, coml2.dll is a legitimate Windows system file, part of the Common Language Runtime. Loading it from the System32 directory is normal. But why is Excel loading it? Maybe it's part of a macro or some interaction. Not sure yet, but not immediately suspicious.\n\nNext, there are several DNS queries from Excel.exe. DNS queries themselves aren't bad, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention the domains being queried. Just the rule name \"DnsQuery\" is noted, but no specific details. So maybe not enough info here.\n\nThen, two events where Excel.exe creates a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\real_values.csv.LNK. A .LNK file is a shortcut. Creating shortcuts in the Recent folder might be normal if the user is accessing files. But why would Excel create a shortcut? Maybe the user opened a file, and Excel is saving the recent file path. However, if this is part of a malicious activity, like creating a shortcut to execute something, that's concerning. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the repetition: multiple DNS queries and the creation of the .LNK file. The same process (Excel.exe) is involved in multiple events. However, Excel is a common application, and these activities could be part of normal operations, like opening files or accessing online resources.\n\nBut wait, the first five events are all User Account Management. That's a bit odd. User Account Management tasks might be related to changes in user accounts, but without specific details like user names, changes made, or authentication events, it's hard to tell. Maybe those are just routine tasks, but if they're part of a larger pattern, like account creation or modification, that could be suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show Excel.exe performing normal activities like loading a DLL, making DNS queries, and creating a shortcut. The User Account Management events are generic. There's no clear indication of malicious activity here. Unless there's something I'm missing, like unusual parameters or unexpected behavior, but the logs don't provide enough detail. So, the classification might be NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear evidence of a security incident. However, the confidence isn't 100% because some events are repetitive and could be part of an attack if there's more context. But based on the given data, it's probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal Excel process activities (DLL loading, DNS queries, shortcut creation) and generic user account management logs without suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
