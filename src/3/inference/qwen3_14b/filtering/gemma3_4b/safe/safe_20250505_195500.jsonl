{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries, all from the SDXHelper process, and each one is about creating a file in a specific path. The files are all named with a pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. SDXHelper might be part of some software, maybe related to Microsoft Office or another application that uses these string files. The fact that there are multiple files being created with different hashes could be normal if they're part of an update or installation process. But then again, it could be something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all have the same base name but different hashes. That makes me think they might be different versions or parts of a larger file. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory might be a red flag. If this is part of a legitimate application, maybe during an update, you'd expect a few files, but not 15 or so with different hashes. That seems excessive.\n\nAlso, the path is in the user's AppData directory, which is common for temporary files or application-specific data. But if the application is creating a lot of files there, that could be a sign of something trying to store data without the user's knowledge.\n\nAnother thing to check is the process itself. SDXHelper—maybe it's a legitimate process, but I should verify. If I don't recognize it, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The fact that all the events are \"File created\" and the same process doing it repeatedly might be normal for some operations, but the high number of files is suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other logs or processes that might be related. For example, if there's another process that's not shown here that's interacting with these files, that could be a clue. But based solely on this data, the key points are the repetition, the number of files, and the naming pattern.\n\nIn some cases, malware uses unique file names with hashes to avoid detection. The fact that each file is a different hash might be an attempt to make them look unique, which is a common tactic. However, this isn't definitive proof, but it does raise a flag.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of a legitimate software update, the system might be downloading and storing multiple files as part of the update process. But again, the number of files here seems high for that purpose. It's more typical to see a few files, not 15 or more.\n\nSo, considering all this, the logs do show a pattern that's potentially suspicious. The high number of files created by the same process with unique hashes in a temporary directory could indicate either a legitimate process with unusual behavior or a potential security threat. Without more information, it's a bit of a judgment call, but the signs are there that this might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Logs:**\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity from the **SDXHelper** process, creating numerous `.js` files in the following directory:  \n`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\OfficeStrings\\...`.  \nEach file has a name pattern:  \n`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hexadecimal hash>.js`, with unique hexadecimal hashes for each file.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n1. **High Volume of Files Created by the Same Process**  \n   - **SDXHelper** is responsible for creating **19 files** (with unique hashes) in a short timeframe.  \n   - This is unusual for legitimate processes, which typically create a small number of files during routine operations (e.g., updates, installations).\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**  \n   - The use of **hexadecimal hashes** in filenames is common in **malware** to evade detection (e.g., avoiding signature-based identification).  \n   - However, legitimate applications (e.g., Microsoft Office) may also use similar patterns during updates or data caching, though typically not with such a high frequency.\n\n3. **Location of Files**  \n   - The files are stored in the **AppData** directory, which is a common location for **temporary or application-specific data**.  \n   - While not inherently suspicious, the combination of this location with the high volume of files raises questions about the legitimacy of the process.\n\n4. **Potential Legitimacy**  \n   - **SDXHelper** is not a well-known process in standard Microsoft Office suites.  \n   - If this process is part of a **third-party application** or a **custom software update tool**, the behavior might be legitimate. However, there is no clear indication of this in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Suspicion:**\n\n- **Unusual File Count**: Creating **19+ files** with unique hashes in a short period is highly atypical for standard application behavior.  \n- **Lack of Context**: No additional logs (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or user interaction) are provided to confirm the legitimacy of the process.  \n- **SDXHelper Process**: The name does not correspond to known Microsoft or widely used software, increasing the likelihood of it being a **malicious or rogue process**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Verify the Process**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Task Manager** to investigate the **SDXHelper** process (e.g., its executable path, parent process, and digital signature).  \n   - Check if the process is associated with any known legitimate software.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:  \n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware detection tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).  \n   - Use sandboxing or behavioral analysis tools to monitor the process in a controlled environment.\n\n3. **Monitor File Activity**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to track file creation, network activity, and registry changes related to **SDXHelper**.\n\n4. **Check for Updates or Patches**:  \n   - If the process is part of a legitimate application, ensure the software is up to date. However, this is speculative without further context.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs exhibit **suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware or a rogue process**, particularly due to:  \n- The high volume of uniquely named files.  \n- The lack of clear legitimacy for the **SDXHelper** process.  \n- The use of hexadecimal hashes in filenames.  \n\n**Further investigation is strongly recommended** to confirm whether this activity is malicious or benign. If the process is not recognized or cannot be verified as legitimate, it should be treated as a potential threat."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office Resources directory. The first thing I notice is that there are a lot of these entries, and each file has a unique hash in the filename. That's a common tactic used by malware to obfuscate the filenames and avoid detection.\n\nNow, the process name is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, SDXHelper might be related to some software, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the fact that it's creating so many files in the Office directory is suspicious. Microsoft Office typically doesn't generate a large number of JavaScript files in that location, especially with random hashes. That's more indicative of a dropper or a downloader, which is a type of malware that downloads additional payloads.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same process creating the same files multiple times. Each entry has the same process name and the same file path, just different hashes. This could be a sign of a persistent infection trying to create multiple payloads or avoid detection by varying the filenames.\n\nI should also consider the context of the files. The files are .min.js, which are minified JavaScript files. While legitimate software might have minified files, the location and the volume here are red flags. Additionally, the presence of a log entry about \"Security Center\" might be a hint, but it's not directly related here.\n\nThe only other entry is about \"Security Center\" which might be a legitimate process, but the rest are all SDXHelper. Since there's no other suspicious activity mentioned, the focus is on SDXHelper's behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated creation of numerous JavaScript files with unique hashes by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location suggests malicious activity. This is a strong indicator of malware, possibly a dropper or part of a larger attack chain. The confidence level here is high because the behavior aligns with known malware patterns.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate **malicious activity** with a high confidence level. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - The process `SDXHelper.exe` is generating **numerous `.min.js` files** in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Resources\\...`  \n     These files have **unique hash-based filenames** (e.g., `min_3a4675727e552daf92a42dd9b4e7b99c.js`), a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.\n\n2. **Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - **High Volume of Files:** The creation of **20+ JavaScript files** in a short period is highly unusual for legitimate software.  \n   - **Location:** The files are stored in a **Microsoft Office resource directory**, which is not typical for user-generated or benign software.  \n   - **File Type:** `.min.js` files are often **minified JavaScript**, which can be used to hide malicious code (e.g., obfuscation, payload delivery).\n\n3. **Process Name (`SDXHelper.exe`):**\n   - While `SDXHelper.exe` is not a well-known legitimate process (unlike `Office.exe` or `WINWORD.exe`), its behavior here is **consistent with malware** (e.g., a dropper or downloader).\n\n---\n\n### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe`  \n- **File Paths:**  \n  `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Resources\\...`  \n- **File Names:**  \n  `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (repeated with unique hashes)  \n- **Behavior:** Mass creation of files in a non-standard location.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs strongly suggest **malware activity**, likely a **dropper or downloader** (e.g., part of a phishing attack or exploit chain). The use of hash-based filenames, the volume of files, and the non-standard location are red flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Isolate the System:** If this is a production or user system, isolate it immediately to prevent lateral movement.  \n2. **Analyze the Files:** Use tools like VirusTotal, YARA rules, or static analysis to check the `.min.js` files for malicious content.  \n3. **Check for Persistence:** Investigate if `SDXHelper.exe` is registered in startup folders, registry keys, or scheduled tasks.  \n4. **Update and Patch:** Ensure all software (especially Microsoft Office) is up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.  \n5. **Monitor for C2 Traffic:** Look for outbound connections to suspicious domains\/IPs (e.g., via network logs or SIEM tools).\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Level:** High (95%+) – The behavior matches known malware patterns (e.g., droppers, obfuscated payloads)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in a specific directory under Microsoft Office's PackageResources. Each entry has the same structure: the process name, the task \"File created\", and the file path. The files all have similar names, differing only in the hash part at the end, like min_4738fbd98dc4bf7f50a72f08ac52629e.js.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these file creations are normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? I remember that some Office components use helper processes for various tasks, like updates or installations. However, creating multiple JavaScript files in the PackageResources folder might be unusual. Typically, PackageResources is used for storing resources related to Office add-ins or updates, but generating so many files with unique hashes could indicate something else.\n\nWait, the fact that all these files are named similarly but with different hashes might be a red flag. Malware often uses unique hashes to avoid detection. However, if these are legitimate updates, they might generate unique files each time. But why so many? Let me check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, like downloading language packs or updates. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be a sign of malicious activity, such as dropping payloads.\n\nAnother angle: the file paths. They're all in the same directory, which might be normal for updates. But if the user hasn't installed any new Office software or updates recently, this could be suspicious. Also, checking the timestamps of these files would help. If they were all created around the same time, it might be part of an installation or update. If spread out, maybe malicious.\n\nI should also consider if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe. A quick search in my mind: sometimes malware disguises itself as legitimate processes. However, without more context, like the system's behavior, other logs, or antivirus alerts, it's hard to tell. The user hasn't provided that info.\n\nBut given just these logs, the repeated creation of multiple files by SDXHelper.exe might be either a normal update process or a potential security threat. Since the files are JavaScript, which can be executed, but they're stored in a resource directory, not an executable one. However, if they're being loaded by Office, that could be a concern.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. But the high number of unique files created by the same process could be suspicious. I should advise the user to check for any recent Office updates, verify the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe (like checking its digital signature), and maybe run a malware scan. Alternatively, if these files are part of a legitimate process, they might be normal. But the key here is that the answer should be based on the given data, which shows multiple file creations by a single process with varying hashes, which might not be typical for a standard helper process.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity by **SDXHelper.exe** creating JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) in the `PackageResources` directory under Microsoft Office's installation path. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process and Path**: \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft Office component, often involved in update or installation processes.\n   - The files are created in the `PackageResources` folder, which is typically used for Office add-ins, language packs, or resource files.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Files follow a naming scheme like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, with unique hash values. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate updates**: Hashes might represent unique resource versions (e.g., language-specific files).\n     - **Malicious activity**: Unique hashes could be used to evade detection by security tools.\n\n3. **Frequency and Volume**:\n   - Multiple files are created in quick succession. While updates might involve multiple files, this volume is unusual for standard Office operations.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **Unusual Behavior**: SDXHelper.exe is not typically associated with generating numerous JavaScript files in `PackageResources`. This could signal:\n  - **Malware伪装 (Masquerading)**: Malware might exploit the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe to drop payloads.\n  - **Compromised System**: If the system is infected, the process could be hijacked to exfiltrate data or execute malicious code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of SDXHelper.exe (should be signed by Microsoft).\n   - Confirm if recent Office updates or installations were performed.\n\n2. **Check for Anomalies**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Windows Defender** to monitor SDXHelper.exe's behavior.\n   - Look for unexpected network activity or modifications to the `PackageResources` directory.\n\n3. **Malware Scan**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software to rule out malware.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the activity could be part of a legitimate update process, the **high volume of unique files** and the **unusual naming pattern** raise red flags. Further investigation (e.g., checking timestamps, network activity, or system integrity) is warranted to confirm whether this is benign or malicious."}

The files are all in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Resources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames are similar, all starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash or some unique string. That's a lot of files being created, and they're all from the same process.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, usually related to Microsoft Office.

However, looking at the filenames, they seem to be minified JavaScript files, which could be part of a legitimate update or installation process. But why so many? Maybe it's part of a large update or a feature that's being deployed. \n\nWait, but there's also some registry events from Chrome. However, those are separate and don't seem directly related to the SDXHelper activity. The Chrome events might just be part of normal operations, like updates or extensions.\n\nAnother thing to check: are these files being created by a legitimate process? If SDXHelper is running as part of a legitimate Office installation or update, this could be normal.

But looking at the files being created, they're all JavaScript minified files. Minified files are common in web applications, but creating a lot of them in the Office directory might be unusual.\n\nNext, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names. The fact that there are 16 entries here, each with different hash values but the same structure, might indicate that this is part of a larger operation. Maybe updating some resources, but why so many files? Also, the directory path is under Microsoft Office, which is a trusted location, but if this is a malicious process, it could be trying to disguise itself as a legitimate one.\n\nAnother thing to note is the naming convention. The \"officeaicopilot\" part might be a typo or a misrepresentation. Maybe it's supposed to be something else. Also, the minified JavaScript files could be part of a payload or a downloader.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if these file creation events are suspicious or not. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office Solution Packages directory. All the files have similar names, starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and \".js\" extension.\n\nFirst, I should check what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but I need to confirm if this is a known legitimate process. Maybe it's part of a Microsoft Office update or a third-party application. If I can't find information on SDXHelper.exe, that might be a red flag.\n\nNext, looking at the file paths: they're all in \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Payloads\\...\" which seems like a standard directory for Office updates. However, the presence of multiple files with the same naming pattern might indicate something. If these files are part of a normal update, there might be a reason for multiple files, but if they're being created in a non-standard way, that could be suspicious.\n\nThe filenames have hashes, which are common in software updates for versioning. But the repetition of the same base name with different hashes might be normal, or it could be part of a malicious payload. I should check if the hashes are associated with known malware. However, without the actual hash values, it's hard to tell. But the user hasn't provided the specific hashes, just the pattern.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are created by the same process might indicate a script or installer that's generating these files. If the user hasn't initiated an Office update or installation, this could be unexpected. But if they did, it's normal.\n\nAnother angle: the presence of multiple files with the same name but different hashes might be part of a legitimate update process where different components are being installed. However, if the files are being created in a location that's not typical for updates, that's a concern.\n\nI should also consider the user's environment. Are there any recent changes or installations? If the user is an administrator, maybe they installed something that's causing this. If not, it might be a sign of malware.\n\nIn summary, the logs show SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in a standard Office directory. The names and hashes are consistent with update files, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. The key points are verifying the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, checking if the files are part of a known update, and ensuring there are no signs of unexpected behavior like high resource usage or network activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Contextual Analysis**\n- **File Location**:  \n  The files are created in the directory:  \n  `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Payloads\\...`  \n  This is a **standard path for Microsoft Office updates** (via Click-to-Run), suggesting **legitimate activity** if the updates are part of a known Office installation or patch.\n\n- **File Naming Pattern**:  \n  The filenames follow a pattern:  \n  `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`  \n  - The use of **hashes** is common in software updates for versioning.  \n  - The presence of **multiple files** with similar names could indicate **different components of an update** or **localized resources** (e.g., language-specific strings).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is a **known process** associated with **Microsoft Office Click-to-Run**. It is responsible for:  \n  - Downloading and installing Office updates.  \n  - Managing setup operations (e.g., extracting payloads, configuring settings).  \n  - **Legitimate behavior** if tied to a Microsoft Office update or repair.  \n\n- **Potential Risks**:  \n  - If **SDXHelper.exe is not part of a Microsoft Office installation**, its presence could indicate **malware** (e.g., a rogue process mimicking a legitimate one).  \n  - **No signs of malware** in the logs (e.g., no network activity, unusual processes, or unexpected behavior), but further checks are needed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags (If Any)**\n- **No obvious red flags** in the logs, but consider:  \n  - **Unexpected behavior**: If the user did **not initiate an Office update**, this activity might be **unauthorized**.  \n  - **Hash analysis**: The specific hashes in the filenames could be cross-referenced with **Microsoft's update repositories** or **malware databases** (e.g., VirusTotal) to confirm legitimacy.  \n  - **Process origin**: Verify that **SDXHelper.exe** is located in a **trusted directory** (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\` or similar).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Confirm Office Update Status**:  \n  Check if a **Microsoft Office update** or **repair** was recently initiated (via Control Panel, Settings, or the Office application itself).  \n\n- **Verify Process Integrity**:  \n  - Use **Task Manager** or **Process Explorer** to confirm the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe`.  \n  - Check for **digital signatures** (should be signed by Microsoft).  \n\n- **Analyze Hashes**:  \n  If the hashes in the filenames are known, cross-reference them with **Microsoft's update catalog** or **malware databases**.  \n\n- **Monitor System Behavior**:  \n  Look for **unusual network activity**, **high CPU\/memory usage**, or **unexpected files** in the same directory.  \n\n- **Run Antivirus Scan**:  \n  Use a trusted antivirus tool to scan the system for **malware** (especially if the behavior is unexpected).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n- **Likely Legitimate**: The activity aligns with **Microsoft Office update processes** if the user initiated an update.  \n- **Potential Concern**: If **no update was initiated**, or if **SDXHelper.exe is not verified**, further investigation is warranted.  \n\n**Action Steps**:  \n1. Confirm if an Office update was recently performed.  \n2. Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` (file path, digital signature).  \n3. Analyze the hashes in the filenames for any suspicious patterns.  \n4. Monitor system behavior for anomalies.  \n\nIf all checks confirm legitimacy, the logs are **normal**. If not, investigate further."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these events. So, there's a bunch of file creation events, all under the SDXHelper.exe process. The files are all JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min_... with different hashes. They're located in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Then there's one event from chrome.exe creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if these file creations are normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in some installation or update processes. But creating so many JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder might be unusual. Typically, that directory might hold package-related files, but JavaScript files could be part of an add-in or some other component. However, the names suggest they're minified, which is common for web apps but maybe not for Office packages.\n\nWait, the fact that all these files are created by SDXHelper.exe could be normal if Office is being updated or installed. But the repetition of the same file names multiple times might indicate something else. Maybe the system is trying to create these files but failing, leading to multiple attempts? Or perhaps it's a legitimate process that's just generating a lot of files.\n\nBut then there's the chrome.exe event creating a temporary file. That's more typical of normal operations, like downloading a file. The temporary file name is a GUID, which is standard for temporary files. So maybe that's just a regular download.\n\nHowever, the JavaScript files being created by SDXHelper.exe might be part of a malicious activity. If these files are not part of a legitimate Office update, they could be malware. But how can I tell? I need to check if these file names are known. The officeaicopilot-strings.min_... names might be part of a legitimate Office add-in, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the \"aicopilot\" part might be a typo or a fake name.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that there are multiple entries for the same file. Maybe the system is trying to create the same file multiple times, which could indicate an error or a loop. But if it's a legitimate process, maybe it's just generating multiple files as part of an update.\n\nI should also consider the location. The AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory is a known location for Office add-ins or solutions. So if these JavaScript files are part of an add-in, they might be legitimate. However, the presence of a large number of such files could be a sign of something wrong, like a malicious add-in that's generating a lot of files.\n\nBut without more context, like the system's other logs, antivirus alerts, or user behavior, it's hard to say. The key here is that all the files are created by SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process. If there's no other suspicious activity, maybe it's just a normal process. However, the high number of files and the minified JavaScript might be a red flag. Minified JS can be used in both legitimate and malicious contexts, but if they're being generated by a system process, it's more suspicious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is installing or updating Office, and these files are part of that process. The repetition might be because the process is creating multiple versions or different parts of the update. But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the file names have a pattern, maybe they are being generated by a script or a tool that's part of the Office installation.\n\nIn the absence of other indicators, I might lean towards this being a normal activity, but the high volume and the nature of the files could warrant further investigation. The chrome.exe event seems benign. So the main concern is the SDXHelper.exe creating all those JS files. If this is part of a legitimate Office process, then it's okay. But if not, it could be malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events, primarily attributed to **`SDXHelper.exe`**, which is a legitimate Microsoft Office process involved in installation or update operations. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity**:\n   - **File Location**: All files are created in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\{User}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **File Type**: The files are JavaScript files (`*.min.js`) with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_{hash}.js`, suggesting they may be part of an Office add-in or localization package.\n   - **Repetition**: Multiple entries for the same file (e.g., `min_a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js`) may indicate redundant creation attempts, possibly due to a process loop, corruption, or a legitimate multi-step installation.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Activity**:\n   - A single temporary file (`ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df18583557.tmp`) is created in the Downloads folder by Chrome. This is typical for browser downloads and appears benign.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a known, legitimate process. The JavaScript files could be part of an Office update, add-in, or localization package. The repetitive creation of files might be due to a multi-phase installation or a retry mechanism.\n  - **`Chrome.exe`** activity is normal and unrelated to the other logs.\n\n- **Potential Concerns**:\n  - The **`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`** file names are unusual for Office. While minified JavaScript is common in web applications, its presence in the `SolutionPackages` directory (typically for Office add-ins) is atypical. This could indicate:\n    - A **malicious add-in** masquerading as legitimate.\n    - A **corrupted update** or **injection of malicious code** into the Office process.\n  - The **repetition of file creation** may suggest a loop or error in the process, which could be exploited by malware.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Check the hashes of the generated JavaScript files against known good hashes (e.g., via Microsoft's official resources or antivirus databases).\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **File Integrity Checker** to detect unauthorized modifications.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Look for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections to unknown domains, unexpected services, or user account changes).\n   - Check for **Office update errors** or **add-in conflicts** in the Event Viewer.\n\n3. **Antivirus Scan**:\n   - Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus software to rule out malware.\n\n4. **User Context**:\n   - If the user recently installed Office or an add-in, this activity may be legitimate. If not, further investigation is warranted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if part of an Office update or add-in installation. However, the **unusual file names and repetition** warrant closer inspection. If no other malicious indicators are present, it may be a benign process. **Further analysis of the files and system logs** is recommended to confirm."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" in the Office Packages directory. The first thing that comes to mind is that these files are all JavaScript minified files. The naming pattern seems consistent, with different hash-like suffixes each time.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or something suspicious. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with this process. Let me think. Microsoft Office does have various helper processes, but I'm not sure if SDXHelper is one of them. Maybe it's part of some add-in or a third-party software that interacts with Office?\n\nThe fact that so many files are being created in the Package Resources folder might be a red flag. Typically, Office applications don't generate a large number of minified JS files in that directory during normal operations. Usually, such files would be part of an installation or update, but if they're being created repeatedly, that could indicate something else, like a malicious process trying to inject code or download additional payloads.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. Each entry is almost identical, just with different file hashes. That could be a sign of a script or process that's generating these files as part of its operation. If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's part of some dynamic loading mechanism, but I can't recall Office doing that. Alternatively, it might be a malware dropper, creating these files to execute later or to hide its presence.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, and these files are part of a legitimate application. However, without more context, like the user's system information or the source of the process, it's hard to say. But given the repetitive nature and the location of the files, it's leaning towards suspicious activity.\n\nIn terms of next steps, checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe would be important. If it's not signed by a trusted entity, that's a bad sign. Also, looking into the parent process of SDXHelper.exe could help determine if it's being spawned by something malicious. Additionally, scanning the system with an antivirus or using tools like Process Explorer to dig deeper into the process's behavior would be necessary.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive, the pattern of multiple minified JS files being created by an unfamiliar process in a non-standard directory is concerning and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate repeated creation of minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) by `SDXHelper.exe` in the Office Package Resources directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Unusual File Generation**:\n   - The process `SDXHelper.exe` is generating numerous minified `.js` files with unique hash-based names. This is highly unusual for legitimate Office processes, which typically do not dynamically create such files in the `Package Resources` folder.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Name**:\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a well-known or documented Microsoft Office process. Legitimate helper processes (e.g., `OfficeClickToRun.exe`) are typically associated with Office updates or installations, not file generation in this manner.\n\n3. **Potential Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The repetitive creation of files with obfuscated names (e.g., `min_cf3fa8b228beccd9d754c476dbbe76e3.js`) may indicate an attempt to:\n     - **Hide malicious payloads** (e.g., embedded scripts or droppers).\n     - **Bypass detection** by varying file names.\n     - **Inject code** into the system or Office environment.\n\n4. **Location of Files**:\n   - The `Package Resources` directory is typically used for storing Office add-ins or templates. Unusual activity here may suggest tampering or unauthorized modifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe`. If unsigned or signed by an untrusted entity, it is likely malicious.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** to inspect the process's parent process, memory, and network activity.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware software (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use specialized tools like **VirusTotal** to analyze the file's hash.\n\n3. **Check for Office Tampering**:\n   - Verify the integrity of Office installations using `Office Deployment Tool` or `Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant`.\n   - Look for unexpected add-ins or registry modifications related to `SDXHelper`.\n\n4. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Monitor network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` for suspicious outbound connections (e.g., to C2 servers).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe behavior described is highly suspicious and consistent with **malware activity** (e.g., a dropper or loader). Immediate action is recommended to isolate the system, investigate further, and remove any malicious components. If `SDXHelper.exe` is confirmed to be malicious, remove it and clean the affected files."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll start by looking through the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. They're located in the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office. Now, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, but I know that some legitimate software might use such names. However, the fact that so many files are being created in a specific directory could be a red flag. Maybe it's part of a normal installation or update, but I need to check for other signs.\n\nThen there are a couple of events related to chrome.exe. One is a registry value set, and another is an image loaded for urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. The image loaded events are normal because those DLLs are part of Windows and Chrome's operations. The registry event might not be suspicious on its own, but combined with the other events, it's something to note.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths, the JavaScript files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. That makes me think of possible malicious activity, like downloading and executing scripts. However, if this is part of a legitimate application, like an Office add-in or some tool that uses those files for localization, it might be okay. But the repetition of the same file names with different hashes could indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which might be a sign of a downloader or something similar.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the process name SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. From what I recall, there's a tool called SDX Helper related to Microsoft's software, but I'm not entirely sure. If it's not a known process, that's a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The fact that the files are being created in the AppData folder is common for some applications, but again, the volume and the nature of the files might be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple file creation events with the same process and similar file names could be indicative of a botnet or malware trying to persist on the system. But again, without more information, it's hard to confirm. The registry event and image loads don't seem to be directly related to the file creations, so maybe they're separate activities.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location, the use of a less common process name, and the potential for those files to be malicious. However, without additional context like the system's usual behavior or the reputation of SDXHelper.exe, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the pattern, it's safer to flag this as potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Pattern:** Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) are created in the path:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`.  \n     These files are consistently named with varying hashes but share the same base filename (`officeaicopilot-strings.min`).  \n   - **Implication:** This could indicate **legitimate software behavior** (e.g., localization files for an application) or **malicious activity** (e.g., a downloader generating files to persist or execute payloads). The repetitive nature and use of a non-standard process name (`SDXHelper.exe`) raise concerns.\n\n2. **`SDXHelper.exe` as the Source:**\n   - **Legitimacy Check:** `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. While it might be part of a **third-party application** (e.g., Microsoft Office tools, drivers, or software installers), its lack of a well-known signature could signal **untrusted software**.  \n   - **Behavior:** Creating numerous files in a user-specific directory (`AppData`) is common for some applications but warrants scrutiny if the files are not expected.\n\n3. **Chrome-Related Events:**\n   - **Registry Value Set (`chrome.exe`):** This is a normal event and likely unrelated to the file-creation activity.  \n   - **Image Loads (`urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`):** These are legitimate system DLLs used by Chrome and Windows Defender, respectively. No immediate concern here.\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual File Behavior:** The consistent creation of JavaScript files with unique hashes in a non-standard location may indicate **malware persistence** (e.g., a downloader or dropper).  \n- **Lack of Context:** Without additional information (e.g., reputation of `SDXHelper.exe`, system baseline, or user activity), it is challenging to definitively classify the process as malicious or benign.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:** Check its digital signature, file hash, and origin. Use tools like VirusTotal or Microsoft Defender ATP for analysis.  \n- **Monitor File Activity:** Track whether these JavaScript files are executed or communicate with external servers.  \n- **Contextual Analysis:** Compare this behavior with the system's normal activity. If this is a new or unexpected pattern, consider it suspicious.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries **raise flags** due to the repetitive file creation by an uncommon process (`SDXHelper.exe`) in a non-standard location. While this could be legitimate, the lack of clear context and the repetitive nature of the files warrant **further investigation** to rule out malicious intent."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about chrome.exe loading a file from the Windows Defender directory, specifically MpClient.dll. That seems normal because Windows Defender is a legitimate security tool, and MpClient.dll is part of its platform. But I should note that sometimes attackers might mimic legitimate files, so maybe that's a red flag, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named officeaicopilot-strings.min with various hashes. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I recall that SDXHelper is sometimes associated with malicious activities, like downloading or executing payloads. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the Office directory might be suspicious, especially if these files are not part of a legitimate Office update or installation.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times. Chrome does interact with the registry, but repeated registry changes could indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThe user downloaded a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx, and there are events related to Zone.Identifier streams. Zone.Identifier is used by Windows to mark files as coming from the internet (downloaded), which is normal. But there are multiple file stream creations, which might be part of the download process or could indicate some tampering. However, this seems more like normal user activity unless there's something else.\n\nLooking at the DNS query from chrome.exe, that's standard for browsing. No obvious issues there.\n\nThe key points are the SDXHelper.exe activity and the repeated file creation in the Office directory. SDXHelper isn't a known legitimate process, and creating multiple JavaScript files in a solution package directory could be part of a malicious payload or data exfiltration. The chrome.exe events, while numerous, don't seem suspicious on their own. The Windows Defender file is legitimate, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in a Microsoft Office directory, combined with the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe, might indicate a potential security threat. However, I need to be cautious not to assume malice without more evidence. But given the context of the files created and the process names, it's worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of normal user activity and potentially suspicious behavior, with the following key observations:\n\n### **1. Legitimate Activity**\n- **Chrome.exe interactions**: \n  - File downloads (e.g., `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) and associated `Zone.Identifier` streams are standard for marking downloaded files.\n  - DNS queries and registry modifications by Chrome are typical for browser operations.\n\n- **Windows Defender (MpClient.dll)**: \n  - The file path (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsDefender\\Platform\\`) is legitimate, and `MpClient.dll` is part of Microsoft Defender. No immediate red flags here.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n- **SDXHelper.exe file creation**:\n  - **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is **not a standard Windows process** and is often associated with **malicious tools** (e.g., used in malware for downloading payloads or bypassing security controls).\n  - **File paths**: \n    - The files created (`officeaicopilot-strings.min*.js`) are in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory** (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`).\n    - This is **unusual** because:\n      - The directory is typically used for **legitimate Office add-ins or updates**, not user-generated JavaScript files.\n      - The naming pattern (`officeaicopilot-strings.min`) resembles **obfuscated or malicious payloads** (e.g., JavaScript used in exploits or data exfiltration).\n\n- **Repetition of file creation**:\n  - The same files are created **multiple times** (e.g., `min_f4daea64e41ab931528e60ef3b523fe7.js`). This could indicate **redundant operations** (e.g., failed attempts to execute a payload) or **malicious persistence**.\n\n- **Chrome.exe registry modifications**:\n  - While Chrome does modify the registry, **repeated changes** (e.g., `Registry value set`) could hint at **tampering** or **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., altering browser settings or injecting malicious configurations).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**:\n  - The **legitimate activity** (e.g., Chrome downloads, Windows Defender) does not pose a threat.\n  - The **SDXHelper.exe activity** is **highly suspicious** and warrants further investigation (e.g., process memory analysis, file hashing, network traffic inspection).\n  - The **repeated file creation** in the Office directory could be **malicious** (e.g., a dropper or downloader).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Actions**\n- **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n  - Check the **process origin** (e.g., file path, parent process).\n  - Analyze the **created files** for malicious content (e.g., using antivirus tools, YARA rules, or static analysis).\n  - Monitor **network traffic** from SDXHelper.exe for exfiltration or C2 communication.\n\n- **Verify Chrome.exe behavior**:\n  - Ensure the **registry changes** are tied to legitimate user actions (e.g., browser extensions).\n  - Check for **unauthorized extensions** or **tampered browser settings**.\n\n- **User education**:\n  - Warn the user about **untrusted downloads** (e.g., the `Cronograma.xlsx` file) and the risks of **unknown JavaScript files** in system directories.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is benign, the **presence of SDXHelper.exe** and the **unusual file creation in the Office directory** strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. Further forensic analysis is required to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security threat**."}

The paths are all within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder, which is a common place for Office to store temporary or solution-specific files. \n\nBut wait, there are multiple entries for the same file being created multiple times. For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_js files are created several times with different hashes in the filenames. That might be normal if they're part of an installation or update process, but it's also possible that this is part of a malicious activity where files are being repeatedly written, maybe to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe process loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL used for URL downloading. That doesn't seem suspicious on its own. The Registry value set event by chrome.exe also doesn't stand out immediately. \n\nAnother event is EXCEL.EXE being created from a downloaded Excel file, which is a normal user action. The loading of combase.dll by EXCEL.EXE is also standard. \n\nHowever, the presence of SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages directory might be worth looking into. SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft Office, but if there's an unusual number of files or if they're being created in a non-standard way, that could be a red flag. \n\nI should check if the filenames make sense. The officeaicopilot-strings.min_js files could be part of a legitimate add-in, but the repeated creation might indicate something. Also, the hash in the filename (like min_fed6f639486874dd9ba20993e56de4b2.js) might be a unique identifier, but without knowing what's expected, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal during setup. But if that's part of a larger pattern of unusual activity, it could be relevant. \n\nOverall, most of these events seem to be part of normal user activity and legitimate processes. However, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory might warrant further investigation to ensure that it's not part of a malicious payload or a data exfiltration attempt. But without more context or indicators of compromise, it's a bit hard to tell. \n\nI think the key here is that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, but the repetitive file creation by SDXHelper could be a point of interest. Maybe the user should check if these files are expected or if there's any other anomalous behavior accompanying these events. Since the answer requires a judgment, I'd say it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious. The confidence level is around 50-60%.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily reflect normal user and system activity, with no clear evidence of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** creating JavaScript files in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` is consistent with Office add-in or resource management. The filenames (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_js`) suggest localization or configuration data, which is common during Office operations.\n   - **`chrome.exe`** loading `urlmon.dll` and modifying registry values are standard for browser operations.\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** opening a downloaded Excel file and loading `combase.dll` is typical for legitimate user activity.\n\n2. **Repetitive File Creation:**\n   - Multiple entries of the same file being created by `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `min_fed6f639486874dd9ba20993e56de4b2.js`) could indicate a benign process like updating or caching resources. However, this could also be a tactic to evade detection if part of a malicious payload. Further context (e.g., file content, timestamps, or associated processes) would be needed to confirm.\n\n3. **Winlogbeat Activity:**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a temporary `.yml.new` file during configuration setup is normal for log shippers.\n\n### **Potential Red Flags (Low Confidence):**\n- The **repetition of file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` might warrant scrutiny if it correlates with other anomalies (e.g., network traffic, unexpected registry changes). However, without additional indicators (e.g., suspicious file hashes, unexpected process behavior), this is speculative.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs do not show definitive signs of malicious activity. The observed behavior aligns with typical Office and system operations. However, the repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` could be a point of further investigation if there are other contextual clues (e.g., unusual network activity, unauthorized access). \n\n**Final Judgment:**  \n**Not clearly malicious** (confidence ~60%), but **monitoring** for additional anomalies is advisable."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path seems a bit unusual. Office usually doesn't generate JS files in those folders, especially with names like \"word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js\". The long, random-looking filename might be a red flag. Maybe it's a malicious file being dropped there.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. But the repetition might not be a big issue here. However, I notice that some of these are loaded multiple times, but that could just be part of Excel's normal operation.\n\nNext, there's a FileCreate event for a temporary Excel file (~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx) in the Downloads folder, followed by a FileDelete event. That seems like a normal temporary file creation and deletion, maybe when editing a document. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are several Registry value set events from svchost.exe. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be normal or could indicate something malicious. However, without more context, like which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say. The same applies to HxTsr.exe modifying the registry. HxTsr isn't a standard Windows process; maybe it's part of some third-party software, but I'm not sure. If it's not a known good process, that could be a concern.\n\nThe SDXHelper.exe is creating files again in another SolutionPackages directory, similar to the first event. The filename here is \"af-za-ui-strings-json_d4db2b9ad99544388b669f17a6a96d46.js\". Again, the long, random name and the location in Office's SolutionPackages might indicate something unusual. Maybe these are malicious files being dropped by SDXHelper, which could be a legitimate Office process or something else.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. SDXHelper.exe creating files in Office directories with odd filenames, along with registry changes from svchost and HxTsr.exe. But I need to check if SDXHelper is a legitimate process. A quick check: SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Solution Packages. However, creating JavaScript files in those directories might not be standard. Office might use those directories for resources, but the filenames here look like they could be generated by an attacker.\n\nThe repeated creation of files in SolutionPackages, especially with such long hashes in the names, might be an indicator of malicious activity. Also, the presence of HxTsr.exe, which I don't recognize as a standard process, modifying the registry adds another layer of suspicion. Even if some of these events are normal, the combination of unusual file creations and unknown processes modifying the registry could be a sign of compromise.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious not to overinterpret. Some of these could be legitimate. For example, Excel might generate temporary files, and svchost.exe is a normal process. But the SDXHelper creating files with those specific names and locations, along with HxTsr.exe's registry changes, might warrant further investigation. The key here is the unusual file paths and the presence of non-standard processes. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous, but the combination of these factors makes me lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents a **moderate risk** and is **interesting for investigation** due to the following observations:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Multiple files with **long, hash-like names** (e.g., `word_88b086261de1446381728f2f003dad876baa5ace5feab65b3fba352ef7fab4c6.js`) were created in **Office-specific directories** (`%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`). \n   - While `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Office process, the **unusual filenames** and **repeated creation of JavaScript files** in non-standard locations could indicate **malicious resource injection** or **tampering**.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by Non-Standard Processes**:\n   - **`HxTsr.exe`** (not a recognized Microsoft or common Windows process) and **`svchost.exe`** (a legitimate host process) both triggered `Registry value set` events. \n   - While `svchost.exe` is normal, **`HxTsr.exe`** lacks a clear benign association, raising concerns about **unauthorized registry changes** that could persist malware or configure persistence.\n\n3. **Redundant File Operations**:\n   - A **temporary Excel file** (`~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) was created and immediately deleted. While this is common during document editing, the **absence of user interaction** or context (e.g., no open Excel process) could hint at **automated file manipulation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**:\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** is associated with **Microsoft Office Solution Packages**, but its behavior here is **non-standard**. The files created resemble **malware payloads** or **exploit kits** (e.g., JavaScript files embedded in Office documents).\n- **`HxTsr.exe`** is not listed in Microsoft’s process database or common software repositories. Its presence and registry edits suggest **potential malicious intent**.\n- **Repeated `ImageLoad` events** for system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `urlmon.dll`) are **normal for Excel**, but their **frequency** could be a red flag if unrelated to user activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**:\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Verify the **digital signature** of the executable.\n   - Monitor its **network activity** and **file operations** for anomalies.\n   - Check if the created JavaScript files are **legitimate Office resources** or **malicious payloads**.\n\n2. **Analyze `HxTsr.exe`**:\n   - Determine its **origin** (e.g., installed software, downloaded files).\n   - Audit the **registry changes** it made for persistence or configuration.\n\n3. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check **process tree** (e.g., parent processes of `SDXHelper.exe` and `HxTsr.exe`).\n   - Review **network traffic** for communication with suspicious IPs\/domains.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile some events (e.g., temporary file creation) are benign, the **combination of unusual file operations, non-standard processes, and registry edits** warrants further investigation. This batch is **interesting for investigation** due to potential indicators of **malware activity** or **compromise**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. The paths all seem to be under the user's AppData folder. Now, SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, specifically for handling solution packages. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in that directory might be normal, or it could be something suspicious. However, the same file paths are repeated multiple times, which might indicate that the process is creating the same files over and over again. That could be a sign of something wrong, like a loop or an attempt to inject malicious code.\n\nThen there are events related to EXCEL.EXE. It's creating streams in a temporary directory, including a Zone.Identifier, which is typically used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the internet. That's normal for downloaded files. Also, there's an image loaded from coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL. Both of these are legitimate system files, so that doesn't seem suspicious. But the repetition of the same events might be worth noting. For example, the Zone.Identifier is created twice, and the image loads are repeated. Maybe that's just part of the normal process, but maybe not.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that all the SDXHelper.exe activities are in the SolutionPackages directory, which is part of Office's handling of add-ins and solutions. However, the fact that so many files are being created, and they're all JavaScript files, might be unusual. Normally, you might expect some other types of files, or maybe the process is part of an Office update or installation. But if this is happening in a short period, it could indicate a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be looking for signs of malware. If SDXHelper.exe is being used to drop malicious JavaScript files, that's bad. But how can I tell? Well, the filenames are all in the format of language codes followed by \"-ui-strings-json\", which sounds like they could be part of a legitimate localization process. However, if these files are not part of a known Office update or package, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the repetition of the same file creation events. Each entry is almost identical, which might suggest that the process is stuck in a loop, or that there's a script that's repeatedly creating the same files. That's not typical behavior. On the other hand, if the system is doing a bulk operation, like deploying a new Office add-in, that might be normal. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the EXCEL.EXE events, the Zone.Identifier is a marker for downloaded files, so if the user opened a malicious file, that would show up here. But the other image loads are standard system DLLs. The fact that the same events are logged multiple times might be part of the normal operation, like when Excel starts up and loads necessary components.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious activity is the repeated creation of JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe. While SDXHelper is a legitimate process, the volume and repetition of these file creations could indicate an issue. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate Office operation, but without more information, it's hard to confirm. Therefore, this batch of events might be worth investigating further to determine if there's an underlying issue, such as a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper or an unexpected behavior from the Office application.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of legitimate and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity**\n- **Legitimate Context**: `SDXHelper.exe` is a known Microsoft Office process associated with managing solution packages (e.g., add-ins). The files created (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json.js`) may relate to localization or Office add-in resources.\n- **Suspicious Patterns**:\n  - **Repetition**: The same files are created multiple times in quick succession. While this could be part of a bulk deployment, repeated file creation by a single process without clear purpose (e.g., updates, installations) may indicate anomalies.\n  - **File Naming**: The `.js` files in `PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` are unusual for standard Office operations, which typically involve `.manifest`, `.dll`, or `.xml` files. This could hint at unexpected behavior, such as injection of scripts or unauthorized resource deployment.\n\n### **2. EXCEL.EXE Activity**\n- **Legitimate Context**:\n  - **Zone.Identifier**: The creation of `:Zone.Identifier` streams is normal for downloaded files, as Windows uses them to track file origins.\n  - **Image Loads**: Loading `coml2.dll` and `VBEUI.DLL` are standard for Excel operations (e.g., COM object handling, VBA interfaces).\n- **Red Flags**:\n  - **Repetition**: The same events (e.g., `1680A406.xlsx` creation, `Zone.Identifier` streams) are logged multiple times. While this might be part of normal Excel workflows (e.g., temporary file handling), excessive repetition could indicate a loop or malicious activity (e.g., persistent download or execution).\n\n### **3. Overall Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk**: The activity is not definitively malicious but warrants further investigation due to the following:\n  - **Unusual File Types**: The presence of `.js` files in a directory typically reserved for Office packages raises questions about their purpose.\n  - **Repetition**: The repeated creation of identical files by `SDXHelper.exe` and redundant Excel events may suggest a process anomaly, such as a stuck loop, unauthorized script execution, or a compromised system component.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Monitor for Additional Anomalies**: Check for other unusual processes, network activity, or file modifications on the system.\n2. **Verify Legitimacy of Files**: Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **File Integrity Checker** to confirm whether the `.js` files are part of a legitimate Office update or package.\n3. **Check for Malware**: Run a full system scan using updated antivirus software to rule out malware masquerading as `SDXHelper.exe` or Excel-related processes.\n4. **Review System Logs**: Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, firewall logs) to identify potential root causes.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the observed activity could be part of normal Office operations, the repetition of file creation and the presence of `.js` files in an atypical location merit closer scrutiny. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a benign process or an indicator of compromise."}

The first entry is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages folder. The same file paths are repeated, which might indicate some kind of package or update. However, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's a red flag. Then there are several registry events from Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE. The EXCEL.EXE entries are creating .LNK files in the Recent folder, which is typical for Excel when opening files, but the repetition might be normal. However, the multiple registry value sets from EXCEL.EXE could be suspicious if they're modifying critical keys. But looking at the data, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The SDXHelper.exe files might be part of a legitimate Office add-in or solution package, but the lack of other suspicious activity and the repetition of the same files might not be enough to classify this as interesting.

The first 27 entries are all Excel.EXE processes triggering \"Registry value set\" events. Then there are two entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in a specific directory under AppData.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that Excel.EXE is involved in a lot of registry changes. But is that suspicious? Well, Excel can modify the registry for various reasons, like updating settings or add-ins. However, if it's doing this repeatedly, maybe there's something off. But without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. Maybe a legitimate process, maybe not. But the sheer number of events might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe creating files. The file paths are under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names look like they could be part of an Office add-in or package. But the names have random strings, which could be normal for generated files. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating these files might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. But again, without knowing the exact context, it's tricky.\n\nWait, but the user wants to know if the batch is interesting for investigation. So combining both parts: multiple registry changes by Excel and two file creations by SDXHelper. If these events are all within normal operations, then maybe not. But if there's something unusual, like unexpected registry modifications or files in suspicious locations, that could be a sign.\n\nBut looking at the file paths, they are in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific data. The presence of \"SolutionPackages\" might be related to Office solutions or add-ins. The files are JavaScript files, which could be part of a web-based add-in. However, if these files are being created in a way that's not typical for the system, it might be suspicious.\n\nHowever, the majority of the logs are about Excel.EXE modifying the registry. If that's part of a legitimate process, like updating settings or handling macros, it might not be an issue. But if the registry changes are to keys that are not usually modified by Excel, that could be a problem. Since the logs don't specify the registry keys, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the SDXHelper.exe events are creating files. If this is a known legitimate process, like part of Office's setup, then it's okay. But if SDXHelper.exe isn't a known good process, that could be a problem. However, the name SDXHelper.exe might be associated with Microsoft, but I'm not sure. Need to check that.\n\nIn any case, the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and file creations by another process might be worth investigating. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence might be around 0.6, as there's some suspicious activity but not enough to be certain.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE. The SDXHelper.exe is creating multiple JavaScript files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The paths mention things like \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\" with various language codes and string files. The EXCEL.EXE is doing DNS queries, but those might be normal if the user is accessing online resources.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or solutions. However, the sheer number of files being created here seems a bit unusual. Typically, Office might create some files, but creating so many JavaScript files with different language codes might be part of a legitimate update or installation. But maybe not. \n\nWait, the files are named things like \"office-strings.min.js\" and others. Those could be part of a legitimate Office package, but the repetition and the specific paths might indicate something else. Also, the fact that multiple files are being created in different language directories could be part of a localization process. However, if this is happening on a user's machine without their knowledge, that might be suspicious.\n\nBut then again, if the user is installing a new Office add-in or updating Office, this could be normal. The DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE could be part of connecting to Microsoft's servers for updates or licensing. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the key point here is that all these files are being created by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a normal Office operation, then it's not a threat. However, if SDXHelper.exe is being used maliciously, perhaps to drop malicious scripts, that's a problem. But the file names and paths don't immediately look like malware. They resemble legitimate Office resources.\n\nAnother angle: the repetition of file creation. Each file is being created twice, maybe as part of a redundancy check or installation process. That's not necessarily bad. However, if the system is generating an unusual number of such files, that could be a sign of something else. But again, without knowing the user's activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear signs of malware. The processes involved are legitimate, and the actions taken (file creation, DNS queries) could be part of normal operations. However, the volume of file creation might warrant further investigation to ensure that it's not part of a larger malicious activity. But based solely on the provided logs, it's not clearly suspicious. So maybe the answer is that it's not interesting for investigation unless there's additional context indicating otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries involve **SDXHelper.exe**, a legitimate component of Microsoft Office used for managing add-ins and solutions, creating multiple JavaScript files in specific directories under `Microsoft\\Office\\...\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`. These files appear to be localized resource files (e.g., `office-strings.min.js`, `transcription-strings.min.js`) with language-specific identifiers (e.g., `cs-cz`, `cy-gb`). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Process**: \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known, legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office. It is typically involved in deploying or managing Office add-ins, solutions, or updates.\n   - The file paths and naming conventions (e.g., `vendor_*.js`, `transcription-strings.min.js`) align with typical Office resource files, possibly part of a localization package or add-in deployment.\n\n2. **DNS Queries from EXCEL.EXE**:\n   - The DNS queries from **EXCEL.EXE** are not explicitly suspicious in isolation. They could relate to Office online services, licensing, or connectivity checks.\n\n3. **Volume of File Creation**:\n   - While the repeated creation of files (e.g., `office-strings.min.js` appearing twice) might seem unusual, it could be part of a redundancy check, installation process, or update mechanism.\n\n4. **No Clear Malicious Indicators**:\n   - The logs do not show signs of malware (e.g., unusual process names, unexpected network activity, or file execution). The activities described are consistent with legitimate Office operations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe log entries **do not clearly indicate a security threat**. The activities appear to be part of normal Office operations, such as add-in deployment or localization.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like da-dk-ui-strings-json and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes install language packs or resources, which might involve creating such files. SDXHelper.exe could be part of the Office setup or update process. However, the fact that there are multiple entries for the same files might indicate that they're being repeatedly created, which isn't typical for standard installations.\n\nWait, but looking at the paths, they're all under PackageResources\\OfflineFiles. That sounds like part of a Click-to-Run installation or an Office 365 deployment. Those installations often generate temporary files or resource packages. But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe there's a loop or an error in the installation process causing it to recreate the same files over and over.\n\nAnother angle: the process is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office and is used during installation or updates. But if this is happening in a user's environment without an active installation, it might be suspicious. However, the user hasn't provided context about whether an Office installation is ongoing.\n\nAlso, the filenames have hashes in them, like _ed29a165ca6b030bb1baf0df3238d022.js. That could be part of versioning or unique identifiers for different language packs. But again, if this is part of a legitimate installation, it's normal. However, if the user is not installing Office and these events are occurring, it might be a sign of something else.\n\nBut the user hasn't mentioned any other symptoms like high resource usage, unexpected network activity, or other anomalies. Based solely on the logs provided, the files are being created in a directory associated with Office, by a process that's part of Office installation. The repetition might be normal if it's part of a multi-step installation process that touches the same files multiple times. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nIn a security context, though, any unusual file creation, especially in system directories or by processes that aren't expected, could be a concern. But SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process. So, unless there's other suspicious activity, this might not be malicious. Still, the repetition could be worth investigating further, maybe checking the system for any pending Office updates or installations.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that **SDXHelper.exe**, a legitimate Microsoft process associated with **Office installation\/update operations**, is creating multiple **language-specific UI string resource files** in the `Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` directory. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known component of **Microsoft Office** (part of the Click-to-Run deployment infrastructure). It is typically involved in installing or updating Office applications and language packs.\n\n2. **File Creation Context**:\n   - The files (e.g., `en-us-ui-strings-json_328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js`) are **language-specific UI resource files**. These are commonly generated during **Office installation, updates, or language pack deployments**.\n   - The filenames include **hashes** (e.g., `_328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10`), which are likely version identifiers or unique keys for specific resources.\n\n3. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - The same files are logged multiple times (e.g., `en-gb-ui-strings-json_ed29a165ca6b030bb1baf0df3238d022.js` appears twice). This could indicate:\n     - **Redundant operations** during an ongoing Office installation\/update.\n     - **Temporary file generation** as part of a multi-step deployment process.\n     - **Potential anomalies** (e.g., loops or errors) if the same file is repeatedly created without a clear purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **No clear security threat** is evident from the logs alone. The process and files align with **legitimate Office operations**.\n- However, **repetition of the same file creation** could warrant further investigation if:\n  - The user is **not actively installing\/updating Office**.\n  - The system shows **unusual resource usage** (CPU, disk, network) related to these events.\n  - The files are being created in **unusual locations** or with **unexpected permissions**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for Active Office Installation\/Updates**:\n   - Confirm if an Office installation, update, or language pack deployment is in progress.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Resource Monitor** to observe SDXHelper.exe's activity (e.g., network traffic, disk I\/O).\n\n3. **Verify File Integrity**:\n   - Ensure the files are not being generated by **malware impersonating SDXHelper.exe** (e.g., check digital signatures, hash values against known good binaries).\n\n4. **Review Windows Logs**:\n   - Check **Application\/Setup logs** for Office-related events that might explain the file creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs appear to reflect **normal Office deployment behavior**, but the **repetition of file creation** should be validated in context. If no Office installation\/update is occurring, further investigation is warranted to rule out anomalies."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and seem to be UI string resources. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of its normal operations, like handling add-ins or language packs. The filenames include things like 'et-ee' and 'fr-fr', which are language codes. That makes me think these could be localization files for different languages.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many entries? Each entry is a separate file creation. However, looking at the paths, some of them are in the same SolutionPackages folder, like '36f79ca6696ef13519f73086e4ea477b' which might be a specific package ID. The repetition of the same file paths in multiple entries could indicate that the process is creating multiple files, but maybe that's part of a legitimate update or installation.\n\nHowever, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create such files. If this is a legitimate process, then it's probably okay. But if there's any indication that these files are being created in an unusual way or if there are other suspicious activities, that could be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the filenames again, they all end with '-ui-strings-json' which suggests they are UI-related JSON files. That seems plausible for localization. But I should also consider if there are any known malicious activities associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I recall, SDXHelper is a legitimate process, but sometimes malware can masquerade as legitimate processes.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same file creation events. If these are all part of a single operation, like installing a language pack, then it's normal. But if they're spread out over time or if there are other anomalous events, that might be a concern. However, the data provided here only shows file creation events without other context like network activity or registry changes.\n\nIn conclusion, based solely on the information given, these events appear to be part of normal operations by SDXHelper.exe related to Office localization files. There's no immediate indication of malicious activity. But further investigation into the specific files and their contents might be necessary if there's any doubt.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that **SDXHelper.exe**, a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, is creating multiple JSON files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. These files are named with language codes (e.g., `et-ee`, `fr-fr`) and appear to be **UI string resources** for localization purposes. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process**: \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known, legitimate process associated with Microsoft Office, often involved in managing add-ins, updates, or language packs.\n   - The files being created (`*.json`) align with typical localization files used for multilingual support in software.\n\n2. **File Naming and Path**:\n   - The filenames (e.g., `fi-fi-ui-strings-json_...`) suggest they are **language-specific UI resource files**.\n   - The path (`%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<guid>\\...`) is consistent with how Office stores add-ins or language-specific packages.\n\n3. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - The same files are logged multiple times, but this may reflect **normal operations** (e.g., caching, updates, or repeated access during application startup).\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Suspicious?**\n- **No immediate red flags** are present. The behavior aligns with **normal Office operations**, particularly during:\n  - Language pack installation or activation.\n  - Add-in deployment or updates.\n  - Localization configuration changes.\n\n- **Potential Concerns** (if additional context were available):\n  - Unusual network activity or registry changes alongside these events.\n  - Files with similar names but different hashes or contents (indicating tampering).\n  - High volume of such events over a short period (could indicate a malicious process mimicking legitimate behavior).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **No action required** based on the provided data. This appears to be **normal behavior** for a legitimate process.\n- If you have access to the system, verify:\n  - The **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n  - The **integrity** of the files (e.g., via antivirus scans or hash verification).\n  - Whether the user has recently installed Office updates or language packs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**Not suspicious.** The events are consistent with **legitimate Office operations** related to localization or add-in management. No further investigation is warranted unless additional anomalies are observed."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, specifically under OfflineFiles. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like fr-fr, ga-ie, etc. That seems normal for Office installations, which often have multiple language packs.\n\nBut wait, there's a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting logs, so that might be part of a monitoring setup. However, the filename is .yml.new, which could indicate a temporary file during configuration. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe entries again. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, used for various tasks like installation and updates. Creating these UI string files as part of an Office update or installation makes sense. But why so many entries? Are they all part of a single process or multiple processes? The timestamps aren't provided, so I can't tell if they're spread out or happening all at once.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any unusual file paths or unexpected processes? The files are all in the expected Office directories, and the processes are SDXHelper and winlogbeat, both legitimate. No signs of malware or unexpected activity here.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be a red flag. But considering the context of Office updates, it's plausible. Also, the presence of winlogbeat could be part of a legitimate log monitoring setup. Unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper creating too many files, but I don't recall that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the activity seems normal for Office updates and log monitoring. No obvious signs of malicious activity. Therefore, maybe not interesting for investigation unless there's more context indicating otherwise. But the user might be looking for something else, like if the files are being created in an unusual way or if there's a high volume. But with the given data, it's hard to say. I'll lean towards not interesting unless there's more info.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries consist of multiple file creation events primarily attributed to **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Microsoft Office-related process) and **winlogbeat.exe** (a log collection tool). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**:\n1. **Legitimate Processes**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is associated with Microsoft Office and is known to create files during installation, updates, or language pack deployments. The filenames (e.g., `fr-fr-ui-strings.js`, `hi-in-ui-strings.js`) suggest language-specific resources, which aligns with typical Office behavior.\n   - **winlogbeat.exe** is a legitimate tool for log collection and monitoring. The file `.winlogbeat.yml.new` appears to be a temporary configuration file, consistent with its normal operation.\n\n2. **No Suspicious Patterns**:\n   - All file paths are within expected directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`), and no unusual or non-standard paths are present.\n   - No signs of malware, unauthorized access, or anomalous process behavior (e.g., unexpected command-line arguments, unexpected parent processes).\n\n3. **Repetition of Events**:\n   - While there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files, this is consistent with Office updates or installations, which often involve bulk file operations. Without timestamps or context about timing, this alone is not suspicious.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe activity described is **not indicative of a security threat** and appears to be **legitimate system behavior** related to Office updates and log monitoring. **No further investigation is warranted** based on the provided data unless additional context (e.g., unexpected process behavior, unauthorized access, or correlation with other alerts) is available.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not Interesting for Investigation**."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating various JavaScript files in the Office Solution Packages directory. The task is to determine if this is a security threat or just normal activity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the installation or updates of Office applications. It might be involved in deploying solutions or managing add-ins. So, if this process is creating files in the Office Packages folder, that could be part of its normal function.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all end with \".js\" and have hashes or random strings in them. That's common for generated files, maybe resources or scripts used by Office add-ins or solutions. The paths are all within the \"Solution Packages\" directory, which is a known location for Office solutions. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. Are there any unusual patterns? The same process is creating multiple files, but that's not necessarily bad. If the files are being created frequently or in large numbers, that might be a red flag. But in this case, the logs show multiple entries, but each seems to be a different file. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the process's legitimacy. If SDXHelper.exe is a genuine Microsoft process, then this activity is likely normal. But if the process is not from Microsoft, that's a problem. However, the user hasn't mentioned any malware indicators here. \n\nAlso, the fact that the files are being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" subdirectory might be part of caching or preparing resources for offline use, which is common in Office applications. \n\nI should also think about typical attack vectors. Malware sometimes creates files in system directories or uses legitimate processes to hide their activities. But in this case, the location and the process name seem to align with normal Office operations. \n\nHowever, without more context, like the system's security status, other processes running, or if there are any alerts from antivirus software, it's hard to be 100% certain. But based solely on the logs provided, the activity seems to be part of the normal functioning of SDXHelper.exe as it manages Office solution packages.\n<\/think>\n\nThe activity described in the logs appears to be **normal and legitimate**, based on the context provided. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Identity:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a known legitimate process associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically, it's involved in managing solution packages, add-ins, or updates). It is not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern:**\n   - The files being created (e.g., `icon_fluent_icon_93f17562456ea5a7ca5f9cddf1cd4b91.js`) are JavaScript files with hash-like names. This is typical for **Office add-ins, resources, or cached assets** used during installation, deployment, or runtime.\n\n3. **Directory Location:**\n   - The files are created in **`%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\Solution Packages`**, a standard directory for Office solutions and add-ins. This aligns with the expected behavior of `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **No Red Flags:**\n   - There is **no evidence of malicious activity** (e.g., unusual network traffic, unexpected parent processes, or file content). The files are likely part of **Office's internal operations** (e.g., caching, localization, or UI resources).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Likely Legitimate:**\n- **Microsoft Office's Use of `SDXHelper.exe`:** This process is used for tasks like deploying solutions, managing add-ins, and handling resources. Creating `.js` files in the `Solution Packages` folder is consistent with its role.\n- **Hashed Filenames:** The use of hashes in filenames is common for uniquely identifying resources, ensuring no conflicts during deployment or updates.\n- **Offline Files Subdirectory:** The `OfflineFiles` folder suggests these files might be preloaded for offline use (e.g., in scenarios where Office is used without internet access).\n\n---\n\n### **When to Investigate Further:**\nIf **any of the following** were present, further investigation would be warranted:\n- **Unusual parent processes** (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` spawned by a non-Microsoft process).\n- **Suspicious file content** (e.g., obfuscated code, network-related functions).\n- **High volume of file creation** (e.g., thousands of files in a short time).\n- **Antivirus\/malware alerts** for `SDXHelper.exe` or related files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs reflect **normal behavior** of `SDXHelper.exe` as part of Microsoft Office's operations. No immediate security threat is evident. However, if you're unsure about the legitimacy of the process, you can:\n- Verify the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n- Check for **unexpected behavior** (e.g., high CPU usage, network activity).\n- Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Windows Defender** to analyze the process further.\n\n**No action required** unless additional anomalies are detected."}

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions. These look like UI string files for different languages. But why so many? Also, there are some registry events and DNS queries from Excel and svchost.exe.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's used for managing add-ins or solutions. Creating these files might be normal during installation or updates. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe a malicious process is trying to inject files or modify the Office environment. But I need to check if that's typical behavior.\n\nLooking at the registry events, svchost.exe is involved, which is a normal system process. However, multiple registry value changes might indicate some configuration changes. But without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The DNS query from Excel could be normal too, like looking up a server for updates or something.\n\nWait, the key point here is the number of file creations by SDXHelper.exe. If it's part of a legitimate Office process, maybe during an update, but creating the same files multiple times might be an error or an attempt to overwrite. Also, the presence of multiple language-specific files could be a sign of a malicious payload trying to evade detection by using legitimate-looking file names.\n\nHowever, I should consider that Office updates often involve creating various files, and maybe this is just part of a routine update. But the repetition might not be normal. Also, the registry changes could be related to the same update, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence level here is a bit tricky. If I'm not certain, maybe a medium confidence. But the justification would be the unusual number of file creations and the potential for malicious activity, even if it's not confirmed. However, I should also note that these could be legitimate processes. So the classification might be \"interesting\" but not necessarily malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"Interesting for Further Investigation\",\n  \"justification\": \"The logs show repeated file creation events by 'SDXHelper.exe' in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate legitimate activity (e.g., add-in updates) but could also suggest attempts to inject or modify Office-related files.

That's a lot. Usually, Excel might modify the registry for its own operations, but 33 times in a row? That seems unusual. Maybe it's part of a normal process, but could also indicate something malicious.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the entire batch is interesting. The first event is a file creation in a Microsoft Office directory. The path has a SolutionPackages folder and a JavaScript file. Maybe that's part of an Office add-in or something. But the repeated registry changes by Excel could be a red flag. However, without more context, like if the registry changes are to suspicious keys or if there's other activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut considering the high number of registry events, even if they are all from Excel, it's worth investigating.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries for EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". That's a bit unusual because Excel typically doesn't modify the registry that often. However, maybe it's part of normal operations, like adding some settings when a document is opened or during an update.\n\nBut then there are several entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like \"kok-in-ui-strings-json...\" and similar patterns. These look like language-specific UI string files. The fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating these files multiple times might be normal if it's part of an Office add-in or localization package. However, the repetition could indicate something else, like a loop or an attempt to inject malicious files.\n\nWait, but the files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is a known location for Office add-ins and solutions. So maybe this is part of a legitimate process, such as installing or updating an Office add-on. However, the repeated creation of multiple files with similar names might be a red flag. Also, the use of SDXHelper.exe—what's that? I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's a helper tool for Office, but I should check if that's a legitimate process.\n\nAnother point is that the registry modifications by Excel might be related to some add-in or macro. If there's an unauthorized add-in, that could be a problem. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The key here is the combination of registry changes and file creations by potentially unknown processes.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe these are all legitimate activities. However, the presence of multiple file creations in a short period could be indicative of malicious activity, such as dropping files. But again, without more information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities could be normal, the combination of registry changes by Excel and repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but the lack of clear context makes it a potential security concern.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a mix of potentially legitimate and suspicious activities. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications**\n- **Activity**: Multiple entries show `EXCEL.EXE` modifying registry values under `RegistryEvent`.\n- **Legitimacy**: Excel may modify the registry during document operations, updates, or add-in interactions. However, **frequent or unexplained registry changes** could signal malicious behavior (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering).\n- **Risk**: Low to moderate if isolated, but **context is needed** (e.g., user actions, timestamps).\n\n---\n\n### **2. SDXHelper.exe File Creations**\n- **Activity**: `SDXHelper.exe` creates numerous `.js` files in `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages` directories. Filenames include language-specific strings (e.g., `kok-in-ui-strings-json`, `lv-lv-ui-strings-json`).\n- **Legitimacy**:\n  - **Possible Legitimate Use**: These files might be part of **Office add-ins**, localization packages, or updates. The `SolutionPackages` directory is used for Office solutions.\n  - **Suspicious Patterns**:\n    - **Repetition**: Multiple identical file creation events in the same directory (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js` created twice).\n    - **Unusual Filenames**: The use of `.json` files with `.min.js` extensions (a mix of JSON and minified JavaScript) is **unusual** and could indicate **malicious payload delivery** or **tampering**.\n    - **SDXHelper.exe**: This process is **not a standard Microsoft Office component**. Its presence and behavior require validation (e.g., checking if it's signed, its origin, and if it's listed in Windows Defender or other security tools).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Potential Threat Indicators**\n- **File Dropping**: The repeated creation of files in `SolutionPackages` could indicate **malware dropping payloads** (e.g., scripts for persistence, data exfiltration, or exploitation).\n- **Registry Tampering**: If `EXCEL.EXE` is modifying registry keys related to **security settings, trusted locations, or add-ins**, this could be a **red flag**.\n- **Lack of Context**: No timestamps, user context, or process parentage is provided, making it harder to assess intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check if the process is legitimate (e.g., file signature, origin, and behavior).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Windows Defender** to analyze the process.\n   - Monitor network activity to detect communication with external servers.\n\n2. **Audit Registry Changes**:\n   - Review the specific registry keys modified by Excel to determine if they relate to **add-ins, macros, or security policies**.\n\n3. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools.\n   - Use **sandboxing** to analyze suspicious files (e.g., `transcription-strings.min.js`).\n\n4. **Review User Context**:\n   - Determine if the user account associated with these activities has **elevated privileges** or access to sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activities (e.g., file creation in `SolutionPackages`) could be **legitimate Office operations**, the **combination of registry tampering by Excel**, **repeated file creation by an unknown process (SDXHelper.exe)**, and **unusual filenames** raises **moderate to high suspicion of malicious activity**. Further investigation is warranted to rule out threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths are all under Microsoft Office Solution Packages, specifically in the PackageResources\/OfflineFiles directory. The filenames end with -ui-strings-json.js, which makes me think they're UI string resources for different languages. For example, mi-mi, mr-in, etc. These are probably localization files for various languages, like Norwegian, Malay, etc.\n\nNow, the key here is to see if there's anything suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So if it's creating these files as part of normal operations, like updating or installing language packs, that's normal. But if these files are being created in an unexpected location or by a process that shouldn't be doing that, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the paths again, they all seem to be within the expected Office directory structure. The process is SDXHelper.exe, which I believe is associated with Office updates. The repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be part of a normal installation or update process. However, if there's a large number of such files being created, maybe that's unusual. But in this case, the user provided multiple entries for different languages, which seems normal for localization.\n\nThere's also one event where Excel.exe is creating a file, but that's part of the same package. The other events are all SDXHelper.exe. The presence of a registry key modification by the same process might be part of the installation process as well.\n\nBut wait, is SDXHelper.exe a legitimate process? Let me think. Yes, it's part of the Microsoft Office suite, involved in setup and updates. So creating these UI string files during an update makes sense. However, if these files were being created in a different location, like outside the Office directories, that would be suspicious. But here, they're all within the expected paths.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the volume of events. There are multiple entries for the same file being created, but that might be due to logging each instance. However, if the same file is being created multiple times in a short period, that could be a sign of something wrong. But the logs don't show timestamps, so I can't tell the timing. The user might have selected multiple entries from different times, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, the presence of a registry key modification (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Language Resources) might be part of the update process, adjusting language settings. That seems normal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the events are related to legitimate Office updates, creating language resource files.

This process is responsible for managing language packs, updates, and resource files.\n\n2. **File Paths and Purpose**:  \n   - The files being created (e.g., `xx-xx-ui-strings-json.js`) are **localization\/resource files** for different languages (e.g., `mi-mi`, `mr-in`, `nb-no`). These are standard during Office installations or updates, especially when multiple language packs are applied.\n\n3. **Registry Key Modification**:  \n   - The log includes a registry key modification under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Language Resources`. This is consistent with Office adjusting language settings during an update.\n\n4. **No Suspicious Activity**:  \n   - No anomalies such as unexpected file paths, unauthorized processes, or unusual registry changes are present. All activities align with normal Office update behavior.\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nThese logs reflect **normal Office update operations**.

Both entries are about the creation of a file named ne-np-ui-strings-json_b754f06fbc4336a5d5ce70e8a18358e8.js by the SDXHelper.exe process. The file path is under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory.\n\nHmm, first, I need to check if this is a legitimate file. The filename includes a language code \"ne-np\" which might be Nepali, but the rest of the name seems like a hash or random string. That's a common tactic for malware to disguise filenames. However, the process creating it is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, so it's possible that this file is related to Office's package resources. \n\nBut wait, the file is being created in the OfflineFiles directory. Office might use that for caching, but creating a JavaScript file there? Maybe it's part of a UI string resource. However, the repetition of the same event twice might be a red flag. Could it be a log entry being duplicated, or is it actually happening twice? If it's the same file being created twice by the same process, that might not be suspicious. \n\nAlternatively, the hash in the filename could be a unique identifier, but the fact that both events are identical might suggest a log duplication. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The key here is that the process is legitimate, and the file path is within a known Office directory. Unless there's other events indicating malicious activity, this might be a normal operation. \n\nBut the filename's structure is a bit odd. Maybe it's a false positive. The confidence here is low because there's not enough information. The justification would be that the file is created by a legitimate process in a known directory, but the filename's hash-like nature is suspicious. However, since there's no other evidence, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show a legitimate file creation by SDXHelper.exe (part of Microsoft Office) in a known directory structure for SolutionPackages. The filename contains a language code and hash-like string, which may be normal for resource files but lacks clear malicious indicators.
