The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar each time. They use New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, set triggers for logon, and specify the Administrators group with high privileges. Register-ScheduledTask is called with different task names each time. \n\nWait, calc.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but creating multiple scheduled tasks with that might be suspicious, especially if it's done in a short time frame. Also, the tasks are set to run at logon with high privileges, which could be a sign of someone trying to maintain persistent access. \n\nThen there are other events with PowerShell processes, but without specific command lines. The winlog tasks include Registry value sets and Process accessed events. However, the key part here is the repeated use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with the same structure. \n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. Even though some entries are not directly related (like chrome.exe events), the multiple PowerShell scheduled task creations are a pattern. Since the tasks are set to run calc.exe under Administrators with high privileges, this might be an attempt to establish persistence or execute commands with elevated rights. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just creating tasks. The command_line uses calc.exe, which is normal, but in a security context, creating multiple tasks with such commands could be a red flag. Also, the use of the Administrators group and RunLevel Highest suggests that the task is running with high privileges, which is not typical for normal user activities. \n\nThe presence of multiple similar events with different task names might indicate an automated script trying to create multiple tasks, which could be part of a larger attack. Even though each task is benign on its own, the volume and pattern could be suspicious. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch is likely interesting because it shows multiple scheduled task creations with elevated privileges, which is a common technique in attacks for persistence. The confidence is high because the pattern is consistent and the use of high privileges is a strong indicator.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) for the Administrators group, executing calc.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate Windows and .NET files, so that's normal. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be suspicious if it's being created and deleted quickly, but the names here seem like they could be part of a test or policy check, like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest...\" which might be from a script execution policy test. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event, which isn't too unusual on its own. Then, there's a PowerShell command line that's creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with high privileges. That's a red flag. Creating a scheduled task with such high privileges could be an attempt to escalate privileges or execute code with admin rights. The command line uses 'Register-ScheduledTask' which is a legitimate cmdlet but the parameters here are suspicious because of the high-level permissions and the execution of calc.exe, which is a simple calculator but could be a placeholder for malicious code.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe related to registry value sets. However, Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but the repetition might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Then there are several entries with 'Execute a Remote Command' task, but the process is listed as 'None', which might be an error or a log parsing issue. These could be false positives or indicate something malicious if they're from unknown sources.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin rights. Even though some of the other events might be benign, the scheduled task creation with elevated privileges is a clear sign of potential malicious activity. The other events might be part of normal operations or tests, but the combination with the scheduled task makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is medium because while the scheduled task is suspicious, it's not definitive proof of a threat without more context, but it's enough to warrant looking into it more.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains PowerShell activities involving scheduled task creation with administrative privileges and temporary script file operations, which may indicate privilege escalation or malicious execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event and note what's happening. The first few entries have \"winlog\" with the task \"Execute a Remote Command\" and process as None. That might be a red flag, but maybe they're just normal commands? But then there's an event where a process is \"WmiPrvSE.exe\" and a file is loaded from \"taskschd.dll\". That's part of the Windows Task Scheduler, which is normal, but maybe if it's doing something unusual?\n\nNext, there's an entry with \"svchost.exe\" setting registry values multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but repeated registry changes could be suspicious. Then, a file is created in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\". Creating a task in the System32 Tasks directory might be part of a scheduled task, but \"unidade_comum\" doesn't look like a standard name. That could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for legitimate scripts, but the name \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\" might be a hint. Also, another PowerShell event creating a file named \"entrada_principal.txt\" in the Downloads folder. Not sure yet, but maybe benign.\n\nThen there's a Chrome process loading \"amsi.dll\" and \"MpOAV.dll\", which are related to Windows Defender. That seems normal, but maybe if there's an attempt to bypass them? Also, Chrome doing registry changes might be normal if it's updating itself, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe most suspicious part is the PowerShell command that uses ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe with a trigger at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. Creating a scheduled task that runs as administrator could be a sign of privilege escalation. Also, the task name \"unidade_comum\" is not standard. The fact that there are multiple events related to registry changes and file creation in system directories might indicate an attempt to set up persistence.\n\nHowever, some events are just normal system activities, like Chrome loading DLLs or svchost changing registry values. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with admin rights, multiple registry changes, and file creations in sensitive directories might be indicative of a malicious activity. The presence of \"Execute a Remote Command\" tasks might be part of that.\n\nI should check if the PowerShell command is actually creating a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction, New-ScheduledTaskTrigger, etc., which are legitimate cmdlets. But running calc.exe at logon as admin is unusual. Maybe this is a test or a red herring, but in the context of other events, it could be part of an attack.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch has a mix of normal and suspicious events. The key points are the scheduled task creation with admin rights, multiple registry modifications, and file creations in system directories. Even though some parts are normal, the combination might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.75 to 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and file creation in system directories. The combination suggests possible privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, looking at the data. All the events are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event.\n\nMost of the entries here are about 'chrome.exe' performing a registry value set task. There are eight instances of that. Then there's one DNS query from chrome.exe, another file creation by winlogbeat.exe, and a file creation by powershell.exe. \n\nHmm. Chrome modifying the registry multiple times. Normally, Chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but doing it multiple times in a short period could be suspicious. However, if these are all legitimate operations, like updating preferences or extensions, then they might not be malicious. But repeating the same task eight times might indicate something's wrong. Maybe a loop or a script trying to change registry values repeatedly.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe could be normal, like visiting a website. But if it's going to a suspicious domain, that's a red flag. However, the event doesn't mention the domain, so I can't tell from this data alone.\n\nThen there's the file creation by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. The path seems to be a temporary .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration update. Not necessarily malicious, but maybe if it's in an unusual location or with unexpected content.\n\nThe powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used for scripting, so creating a file could be benign. However, if the file is being used to store malicious data or as part of a larger attack, that's a concern. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe might be normal, but the repetition could be a sign. The other events don't show obvious malicious activity. However, without more information on the specific registry keys, DNS queries, or file contents, it's hard to confirm. The presence of multiple events might be enough to flag this for further investigation. I think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated registry modifications, which could indicate a potential issue, even if not definitively malicious. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, since there's not enough data to be certain but enough to warrant looking into it more.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing repeated registry modifications (8 instances) could indicate suspicious behavior, such as persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering. Additional events include file creation by winlogbeat.exe (normal log shipping tool) and powershell.exe (common for legitimate scripting but requires context). The volume of registry events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
