So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, and others like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The events include process creation, registry value sets, image loaded, and file created. \n\nThe first entry is powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe command line that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line here is important. It's setting up a task to run daily as system, using powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the script by naming it as non-existing? Or maybe it's a typo. But the fact that they're creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (system account) is concerning.\n\nAnother entry shows schtasks.exe creating another task with a similar command line, pointing to c:\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" in the filename. Also, the task is set to run daily. Scheduled tasks running PowerShell scripts with bypassed execution policies could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe with multiple registry value sets. Svchost is a normal process, but multiple registry changes might be part of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The file created event for svchost.exe is about a task in the Tasks directory, which is normal for scheduled tasks.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe is creating a file, which might be part of normal operations, but the .yml.new file could be a configuration change. However, the other events involving powershell and schtasks seem more suspicious.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry value set events. That's a lot, but maybe it's just normal activity unless there's something specific. However, the repetition might be a sign of something, but not sure yet.\n\nPutting it all together: the key points are the use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks running PowerShell with -ep bypass, which is a common technique in attacks to execute scripts without proper execution policies. The filenames having \"NonExistingScript\" might be an attempt to obfuscate, but the fact that the scripts are not found (non-existing) could indicate that the attacker is trying to run a script that's not actually present, which might be a mistake or part of a larger plan. However, the creation of scheduled tasks under the system account with daily recurrence is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even if the script isn't found, the act of creating such tasks is suspicious. \n\nOther processes like svchost and chrome might be normal, but the combination with the schtasks and powershell events points towards something that needs investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because maybe the user is testing or there's a misconfiguration, but the pattern is concerning enough to flag as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created using schtasks.exe with PowerShell commands bypassing execution policies (-ep bypass), pointing to non-existent script files. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious persistence mechanisms and potential code execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification should be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. But the path has a .new extension, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nThe second event is powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but creating files can be part of malicious activity too. However, just creating a text file isn't necessarily suspicious unless there's more context.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe accessing a process. The file field is None here. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing other processes without permission, that might be a red flag. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nFourth event: whoami.exe is executed. That's a standard command to get user info. The process creation here seems normal. No obvious signs of malicious activity here.\n\nFifth event: another process access by powershell.exe. Again, file is None. Maybe PowerShell is interacting with other processes, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, looking at all events together. There's a mix of legitimate processes (winlogbeat, whoami) and PowerShell activities. The creation of files in the Downloads directory might be normal. However, the presence of multiple process access events by PowerShell could be a sign of something. But are there any indicators of compromise? Like unexpected file creation, unusual command lines, or access to sensitive processes?\n\nWait, the first event's file path is a .yml.new file. If that's part of a configuration setup, maybe it's legitimate. But if the user isn't expecting that file, it might be a sign of something. However, the other events don't show obvious malicious activity. There's no mention of network connections, registry changes, or other suspicious activities. The events are mostly about file creation and process access, which can be normal.\n\nI think the key here is that there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The activities described don't seem to indicate a security threat. The classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no suspicious activity detected. The confidence might be around 0.6, as there's some activity that could be normal, but nothing clearly malicious. However, if the user is looking for any possible signs, maybe the multiple PowerShell process accesses could be a minor red flag, but without more context, it's hard to say. So, I'll go with NOT INTERESTING with a confidence of 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process activities (file creation by winlogbeat and powershell, process access) without indicators of compromise. No malicious behavior or security-relevant anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
