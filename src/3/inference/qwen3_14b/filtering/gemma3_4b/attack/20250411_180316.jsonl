That might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious. Also, there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems odd. Why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove a process that's being used for something else.\n\nThen there's the WMIC.exe entries. The command line shows deleting notepad.exe processes. That's a red flag. Also, Image loaded events for urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. These are legitimate system files, but loading them from unexpected places or in unusual contexts could be malicious. \n\nAnother thing is the file created event for .winlogbeat.yml.new. That might be part of a legitimate setup, but if it's in a user's Downloads folder, maybe it's a configuration file being modified. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events might indicate changes to the registry, which is common in malware to persist. But again, some of these could be normal system operations. However, the combination of multiple suspicious activities—like using WMIC to delete processes, multiple powershell and cmd.exe commands, and loading certain DLLs—might indicate an attack.\n\nI should check if any of these events are part of known benign activities. For example, svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are normal system processes. But when combined with other events, especially those involving command-line deletions and multiple process accesses, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe confidence level: there's enough suspicious activity here to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out: WMIC.exe loaded a file from the Windows Defender directory, specifically MpOAV.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's files are usually in known locations, but MpOAV.dll is part of Microsoft's malware protection. However, the path here is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. That version number seems specific. I should check if that's a legitimate version. If it's a known good version, maybe it's normal. But if it's a different version or if the file is being loaded by WMIC, that might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are a bunch of events involving Registry value sets and Process accesses. Processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe are involved. A lot of them are setting registry values, which could be part of normal operations, but when combined with other events, might indicate something malicious. For example, the command line in one of the cmd.exe events is copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. That's a common technique used by attackers to replace the Sticky Keys executable with a malicious one, which is part of the \"evil twin\" attack. \n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe being used to delete a task named \"win32times\". That might be an attempt to remove a scheduled task that's part of a legitimate process or a malicious one. However, the task name is a bit generic. \n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modifications and process creations could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or escalate privileges. Also, the presence of whoami.exe might be checking the user context, which is common in attacks to determine the current user's privileges.\n\nBut wait, the first event about WMIC.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's path. If that's a legitimate file, then maybe it's not malicious. However, if the file's hash doesn't match known good hashes, that could be a red flag. Since the logs don't provide hash information, I have to rely on the process and file paths. \n\nThe combination of the suspicious file load and the other events involving registry changes and process manipulations might indicate a potential attack. However, I need to be careful not to overinterpret. Some of these events could be part of normal system operations, especially with Windows Defender and common utilities like notepad or chrome. \n\nBut the fact that there's a command to replace sethc.exe with sethc_backup.exe is a strong indicator of a potential malicious activity. That's a known method used in attacks. So even though some events might be normal, the presence of that specific command line and the initial suspicious file load would make this batch interesting for investigation.

The winlog events mention things like Image loaded, Registry object added\/deleted, Registry value set, and Process accessed or created. \n\nThe first event is schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll from System32. That seems normal because schtasks is a legitimate Windows tool, and taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler. But then there's a lot of Registry events. Processes like svchost, cmd, conhost, and chrome are modifying registry values. PowerShell is being accessed multiple times. \n\nWait, but some of these might be normal. For example, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services. However, the repeated registry modifications by cmd.exe and powershell.exe could be suspicious. Especially if they're modifying key registry entries that control system behavior. \n\nAlso, there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so that's normal. But the MpOAV.dll path is from the Windows Defender Platform. That seems legitimate too. However, if these were from unexpected locations, that would be a red flag. \n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which is a standard tool to check user context, but if it's being used in a way that's unexpected, like in a script that's part of a larger attack, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, the logs here just show the process creation, not any suspicious command lines beyond the normal execution.\n\nThe repetition of events like Process accessed by powershell.exe might indicate that someone is trying to interact with processes, possibly for reconnaissance.

Then there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. The tasks include Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted, and some Provider\/Engine Lifecycle events.\n\nLooking at the files loaded by PowerShell, there are several .dll files from the .NET Framework, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file might be normal, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with the command line 'powershell.exe & {}'. The empty script might be a way to test or trigger events without actual payload, but combined with the other events, it's possible that this is part of a script that's being run and then cleaned up. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of PowerShell for various tasks. While PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities, the combination of process creation, registry changes, and file operations might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute scripts. However, the presence of legitimate .NET DLLs and the temporary file being deleted might be part of normal operations, like a script that's being tested or a system update.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The key points here are the creation and deletion of a temporary script, multiple PowerShell events, and the image loads.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing some system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. The first few entries mention 'powershell.exe' with tasks like 'Image loaded' pointing to files in the Windows Defender directory. That might be normal, but then there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData folder. That seems suspicious because creating files in user directories can be part of malware activity.\n\nNext, there are several 'Registry value set' events and 'Process accessed' events. These could indicate that something is modifying the registry or accessing processes, which is often a red flag. Then there's a bunch of 'Provider Lifecycle' events with PowerShell commands checking for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd, with lots of '..\\' which might be trying to navigate up directories. That could be an attempt to access files in parent directories, which might be part of a malicious script trying to locate or execute other files.\n\nLooking at the command lines, they all seem to be checking if a specific .bat file exists and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are not standard and have a pattern that might be obfuscating the actual location. This could be part of a script that's trying to execute other malicious files if they exist. The repetition of similar commands in different paths might indicate a systematic check for scripts in various locations, which is suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Process Create' events for PowerShell, which is common but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack. The 'Image loaded' events for 'mscoree.dll' and 'mscoreei.dll' are part of .NET, which is normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a problem.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of creating files in user directories, modifying the registry, accessing processes, and checking for existence of multiple .bat files in non-standard paths suggests potential malicious activity.

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading image files, like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate Windows system files, part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender. Loading these doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of normal operations, like a script testing or temporary file usage. But sometimes attackers create and delete files to avoid detection. However, since it's a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script, and it's in the Temp folder, that could be normal if it's part of a legitimate process.\n\nAnother file created is elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. That seems benign, just a text file. No obvious issues there.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events from Chrome.exe. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but having so many entries might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe Chrome is updating its settings or extensions, which is normal.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events from PowerShell, which could be part of normal inter-process communication. Not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some PowerShell processes, they're checking if certain files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths like C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\.. etc., seem like they might be testing for the presence of specific scripts. But again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. The paths have some odd folder names, but maybe they're just part of the user's environment.\n\nThe presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded by PowerShell could be normal if Defender is scanning or interacting with the process. But if PowerShell is loading Defender's DLLs, that might be unusual. However, it's possible that Defender is doing some analysis on the PowerShell process.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell activities, loading system DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, registry changes from Chrome. However, none of the events show clear signs of malicious activity. The files involved are either legitimate system files or temporary files. The PowerShell commands are basic checks. The Chrome registry events are numerous but not necessarily harmful.\n\nBut wait, the classification needs to be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. The justification should explain why. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior, like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity, maybe this isn't interesting. However, the fact that PowerShell is involved in multiple events might raise some flags. But in this case, all the activities seem to be part of normal operations, even if a bit verbose.\n\nSo, I think the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The events are either normal system operations or benign user activities.

PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. So that's a red flag. Let me check the details.\n\nLooking at the first event, the command line shows creating a new item and setting content to a batch file with the command 'dir'. The paths here are a bit suspicious. They have parts like '..\\pacote_base' which might be trying to navigate directories. Also, the use of 'Set-Content' to write a batch file that runs 'dir' seems odd. Why create a batch file just to run a simple directory command? That might be a way to execute commands or drop files.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime.

Also, the 'Provider Lifecycle' events with similar patterns of creating files and setting content might be part of a larger script or payload deployment.\n\nThe repetition of similar commands across different paths suggests a possible automated process. The use of '..' in the file paths could be an attempt to obfuscate the actual target directory, which is a common tactic in malware. Additionally, the fact that multiple events are related to process creation, registry changes, and image loading might indicate an attack chain where PowerShell is being used to execute malicious code, modify the registry, and load malicious DLLs.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell scripts are often used in enterprise environments for automation. But the combination of creating multiple batch files with 'dir' and loading .NET components might be more indicative of malicious activity.

Alright, let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: PowerShell.exe is involved with an image loaded from a Windows Defender DLL. That seems legitimate because Windows Defender's DLLs are part of the system's security features. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension. PowerShell scripts in Temp are sometimes used by malware to execute malicious code. However, the next event shows that the same file is deleted. That could be a red flag because creating and then deleting a script might be an attempt to hide it.

The paths mentioned, like \"C:\\registro_principal\\registro_temporario\\registro_secundario\\bin\\componente_secundario.exe\" and similar ones, look suspicious because they have a lot of Spanish terms which might be obfuscation.

That's interesting because those files might be part of some code or scripts. But why are they checking for these files? Maybe the attacker is verifying if certain files are present before proceeding with an action.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various .dll files related to .NET Framework.

However, the main concern here is the repeated PowerShell activity and the checking of non-standard file paths. \n\nBut are these activities necessarily malicious? Sometimes legitimate scripts use Test-Path. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, accessing different files, and loading .NET DLLs might be part of a larger operation. The fact that the same command structure is used across different files could suggest automation or checking for the presence of specific components.\n\nI should also consider the frequency. There are multiple entries for ProcessAccess and ImageLoad. While normal operations can have these, the volume here might be higher than usual. Also, the presence of multiple different .cs files being checked could indicate that the attacker is looking for specific files to execute or deploy something.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell activities, the checking of various .cs files, and the loading of .NET DLLs might indicate a suspicious pattern. Even though some of these could be legitimate, the combination and the number of events make this batch worth investigating further. So, I think the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are accessing files and loading .NET Framework DLLs, with command-line arguments checking for specific .cs files.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a PowerShell process loading images from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate files, so that's probably normal. Then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest... and then it's deleted. That might be part of a script testing, but maybe not harmful. However, the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly could be a red flag. \n\nNext, there are several entries with PowerShell processes running commands that check if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like C:\\estrutura_temporario, C:\\tarefa_padrao, etc. These don't look like standard directories. Also, the scripts are named things like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, Get-Keystrokes sounds like it could be malicious, like a keylogger. That's a concerning name. \n\nBut wait, some of the commands are just checking if a file exists and exiting 0 or 1. That might be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present. However, the repetition of these checks across different paths might indicate that the attacker is probing the system for specific files. \n\nAlso, there are events related to registry value set and process access, but those alone aren't necessarily bad. The presence of whoami.exe is normal, but the multiple PowerShell processes with those strange paths and the Get-Keystrokes script name are suspicious. \n\nAnother thing is that the same script name, Get-Keystrokes.ps1, appears multiple times in different directories. That could be an indicator of a malicious script trying to be executed from various locations, which might be part of an attack strategy to bypass defenses. \n\nHowever, I should check if these are all legitimate. Maybe the user is running some tests. But the combination of creating and deleting files in Temp, the repeated checks for scripts named Get-Keystrokes, and the non-standard directories might point to something malicious. \n\nThe confidence here isn't 100% because some of these could be benign, but the patterns are concerning.

So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple PowerShell processes. The command lines involve checking if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists in various paths. The script exits 0 if the file is found, else 1. That seems odd because why would someone check for this specific file? Maybe it's part of a malicious activity, like checking if a keystroke logging script is present. Keystroke loggers are typically malicious, so that's a red flag.\n\nNext, looking at the file events: there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting it quickly might be an attempt to hide the script's presence. Also, the Pipe Created event could be related to inter-process communication, which might be used by malware to communicate stealthily.\n\nThen, there are several Image Loaded events for .NET DLLs. While some are legitimate (like mscoree.dll, clr.dll), the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be normal. However, the combination with the other events raises suspicion.\n\nThe winlogbeat process creating a file is probably benign, as winlogbeat is a log shipper. But the other PowerShell activities are more concerning. The repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might indicate the attacker is trying to locate or deploy this malicious script. The exit codes suggest a conditional check, possibly part of a larger attack strategy.\n\nPutting this together, the combination of PowerShell scripts checking for keystroke loggers, temporary file creation\/deletion, and unusual process activities points towards potential malicious behavior. Even though some components are legitimate, the overall pattern is suspicious. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be normal, but the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and the file operations make this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, which is suspicious.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known place where PowerShell profiles might be stored, but creating a file there could be normal. However, the next few entries show multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and the registry. That might be normal too, but combined with other events?\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a standard command to check user privileges. Not suspicious on its own. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also regular processes. The image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal since that's a legitimate Windows DLL. \n\nWait, the first entry's file path is in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's part of the PowerShell profile, which could be used for persistent access if malicious scripts are placed there. But the file created is named StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which sounds like a normal profile file. However, the fact that it's being created by powershell.exe might not be unusual. \n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. That could indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed, but not necessarily malicious. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is a legitimate activity if someone is installing or configuring the tool. \n\nThe network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe are normal, as Chrome often connects to the internet. Dns queries are also standard. However, the repetition of NetworkConnect events might be a red flag if they're connecting to suspicious IPs, but the logs don't show that. \n\nHmm, the only thing that stands out is the initial file creation in the PowerShell startup directory. If that file is a malicious script, it could be a sign of compromise. But without more context, like the content of the file or unusual commands, it's hard to tell. The other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. \n\nConsidering all that, the batch might not be interesting enough for investigation unless there's more context. The events are mostly normal system activities. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might warrant further look into, but on its own, it's not conclusive.

The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's chrome.exe doing a DNS query, which is normal. Then powershell.exe is accessed a couple of times, and whoami.exe is run. The whoami command is usually used to check user privileges, which might be a red flag if it's part of a larger malicious activity. But just one instance might not be enough.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being created and accessed. The command lines show that it's running commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are used to list files recursively. That's a common PowerShell command for exploration, but if done excessively or in a suspicious context, it could be part of a script to gather information or find sensitive files.\n\nThen, there are several Image Load events for PowerShell. The loaded DLLs include some .NET framework components, which are normal. However, there's also a mention of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but if it's being loaded in an unusual way, maybe that's a sign of something. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common technique used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack. The creation and deletion could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script without leaving evidence.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's use of providers, which are used for interacting with different data stores. But again, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell processes, recursive directory listings, a temporary script file created and deleted, and access to system components. These could be signs of an attacker exploring the system and trying to execute commands without leaving traces. However, some of these activities could be part of legitimate troubleshooting or scripting. The key points here are the combination of events—multiple PowerShell processes, the temporary file, and the recursive commands. That makes me think this might be interesting for investigation, but I need to check if there's enough evidence to classify it as such.\n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some activities are normal, but the combination of events does raise suspicion.

Alright, first, I need to check each entry and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. The command lines involve ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, and gci -recurse. These commands are typically used to list files recursively. But why so many times? Maybe the user is just doing some normal file management, but repeated use could be a red flag. Sometimes attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement or data exfiltration by listing files.\n\nThen, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation, but I should check if there's any unusual path or if it's being used in a way that's not standard. The path is in the Downloads folder, which might be normal, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious purposes.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set events. PowerShell and conhost.exe modifying registry values. That could be part of persistence mechanisms if done without user consent. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But multiple registry changes might indicate something.\n\nAlso, there's a file created in the AppData folder by PowerShell. AppData is a common place for legitimate software, but again, if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nHowever, I don't see any direct signs of malware execution, network connections to bad IPs, or unusual file downloads. The events are mostly about process creation, file creation, and registry changes. The repetition of PowerShell commands might be benign, like a script that's running multiple times, but in a security context, that's something to watch.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch has several PowerShell activities and file creations, which could be normal or could indicate malicious behavior.
