{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. First, I'll look through the JSON entries to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: \"File created\" by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of Elastic's Beats, used for log collection. The file path seems normal, maybe a configuration file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's a logon event with services.exe, which is normal as it's part of the Windows service control manager. The \"Special Logon\" entry is a bit vague but doesn't immediately raise red flags. \n\nRegistry value changes by svchost.exe are common, as svchost hosts various system services. Multiple entries here might be normal system operations, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something if they're too frequent or involve specific keys. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Image loaded events for urlmon.dll by Solitaire.exe and GameBar.exe. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, used for URL handling. Solitaire is a legitimate game, so loading this DLL seems normal. However, multiple image loads might be part of normal operations, but I need to check if there's anything unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple Dns query events from Solitaire.exe. Frequent DNS queries could indicate normal internet activity, but if they're going to suspicious domains, that's a problem. However, the data here doesn't show the domains, so I can't tell yet.\n\nThe most notable part is the numerous File created events by Solitaire.exe in the user's AppData directory. The files created are in paths related to Microsoft Solitaire Collection, which is a legitimate application. However, the filenames include hashes like \"3892ced5b67d28b93c78c20e0aa9a02cfc5709d0.archive\" and similar. These could be legitimate assets, but the use of hashes in filenames might be a red flag. Sometimes malware uses hashes to obfuscate filenames, making them harder to detect. However, it's also possible that the game uses such naming for internal assets.\n\nAnother point is that Solitaire.exe is creating a lot of files in a short time. While the game might need to download or extract resources, the volume here seems high. Also, the presence of .archive files could be something. If these are just data archives, it's okay, but if they're executable files or contain malicious content, that's a problem. But again, without checking the contents, it's hard to say.\n\nThe initial event with winlogbeat.exe seems normal. However, if there's a mix of legitimate and suspicious activities, but in this case, most of the events are related to Solitaire and system processes. The only potential issue is the large number of file creations with hash-based names. Maybe it's part of the game's update or resource loading, but it's worth investigating further. \n\nI should also check for any other anomalies. The User Account Management event is a system event, probably not related. The rest are system and application logs. \n\nOverall, while there's no direct evidence of malware, the high number of file creations with hash names and the volume of DNS queries might warrant further investigation. It's possible that this is just normal activity for the game, but it's on the edge of what's typical. I'd lean towards being cautious and suggesting a deeper look into the files and DNS queries if possible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of normal system and application activities, but there are **potential red flags** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns**\n\n#### **1. Legitimate Processes and Activities**\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** (part of Elastic Beats) creating a configuration file in the `Downloads` directory is **normal** for log collection tools.\n- **`services.exe`** and **`svchost.exe`** are core Windows processes involved in service management and system operations. Their activities (e.g., registry changes) are typically **benign**.\n- **`urlmon.dll`** is a legitimate Windows component used for URL handling, and its loading by **`Solitaire.exe`** and **`GameBar.exe`** is **expected**.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Suspicious Patterns**\n- **High Volume of File Creations by `Solitaire.exe`:**\n  - **`Solitaire.exe`** (a legitimate Microsoft game) creates **dozens of files** in the user's **AppData directory**, including:\n    - Files with **hash-like names** (e.g., `3892ced5b67d28b93c78c20e0aa9a02cfc5709d0.archive`).\n    - Files in subdirectories like `xpwidget_config` and `xpwidget_transitions02`, which may be **resource packs or assets**.\n  - **Why This Matters:** While some hash-based filenames are normal (e.g., for obfuscation or versioning), the **volume and location** (AppData) raise questions. Malware often uses similar naming to avoid detection, and AppData is a common target for stealthy operations.\n\n- **Frequent DNS Queries by `Solitaire.exe`:**\n  - Multiple **DNS query events** from `Solitaire.exe` could indicate **normal game updates or online features**. However, **without domain analysis**, it's impossible to rule out communication with malicious servers.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Missing Context**\n- **No domain information** in DNS queries makes it hard to assess risk.\n- **No file hashes or contents** provided for the created `.archive` files, so their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.\n- **No evidence of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or lateral movement** in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the `.archive` Files:**\n   - Analyze the contents of files like `3892ced5b67d28b93c78c20e0aa9a02cfc5709d0.archive` using tools like **VirusTotal** or **YARA rules** to check for malicious payloads.\n   - Check if these files are part of a known legitimate update or asset pack for the game.\n\n2. **Monitor DNS Traffic:**\n   - Use network monitoring tools (e.g., **Wireshark**, **Microsoft Defender ATP**) to inspect the domains contacted by `Solitaire.exe` and ensure they are legitimate.\n\n3. **Check for Anomalies in System Behavior:**\n   - Look for **unusual resource usage**, **unexpected network connections**, or **unauthorized modifications** to system files.\n\n4. **Consider User Context:**\n   - If the user is running **non-Microsoft software** or has **untrusted sources** installed, the activity may be more suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the log entries do not definitively indicate malware, the **high volume of file creations with obfuscated names** and **frequent DNS queries from a gaming application** are **unusual** and warrant further investigation. These patterns are **common in malware evasion techniques**, but could also be part of legitimate game behavior. A deeper forensic analysis is recommended. \n\n**Verdict:** **Low-to-Medium Risk** (requires further investigation)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of event logs from a system, and they want me to analyze them. The main task is to figure out what's going on here. \n\nFirst, I notice that all the events are related to file creation. The process involved is \"Solitaire.exe\", which is part of the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. The files are being created in a specific directory under the user's AppData folder. The paths seem to be structured with folders like \"dlfiles\", \"globaldata\", \"advertisement\", and various subfolders with numbers and names like \"waterfallconfig_v2.js\" and \"videowaterfallconfig.js\". There are also several \".archive\" files in there.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that this might be normal behavior for the Solitaire app. Maybe it's downloading additional content, like game packs or advertisements. The presence of \"advertisement\" folders and config files suggests that the app might be fetching ads or other downloadable content. However, I should check if there's anything suspicious here.\n\nLooking at the file names, some of them have timestamps or random strings, which could be part of version control or unique identifiers for different content packages. The \"archive\" files might be compressed data being downloaded. But why so many files? Is this typical for the app, or is there an issue?\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. If \"Solitaire.exe\" is legitimate, then this activity is normal. However, if the executable is malicious, it could be downloading harmful files. But without more context, like the source of the executable or any other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle is the use of the \"dlfiles\" directory. That might be a download directory for the app. The fact that multiple files are being created in a short period could indicate a download process. However, the sheer number of files might be concerning. Are these all necessary for the app's functionality, or is there an excessive amount of data being downloaded?\n\nAlso, the presence of \"advertisement\" folders suggests that the app is interacting with ad networks. That's common in free apps, but if the app is not supposed to show ads, that could be an issue. However, the Microsoft Solitaire Collection is a legitimate app, and it's possible that they use ads as part of their monetization strategy.\n\nI should also check if any of the files have unusual extensions or if there are any known malicious files with similar names. But with just the file names provided, it's hard to determine that. The user might need to run a virus scan or check the integrity of the Solitaire executable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the timing of the events. If all these files were created in a short period, it might be part of an update or a content download. If it's spread out over a long time, that could be more suspicious. But the logs don't show timestamps, so that's a limitation here.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information given, this seems to be normal behavior for the Solitaire app, with the process downloading game content and advertisements. However, without additional context or checks, there's a possibility that something could be amiss. The user should verify the legitimacy of the Solitaire executable and ensure their system is up to date with security patches.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **Microsoft Solitaire Collection** (via `Solitaire.exe`) is actively creating numerous files in the user's AppData directory. Here's a structured analysis of the observed activity:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal Behavior for the Solitaire App**\n- **File Creation Context**:  \n  The files are being created in a structured directory (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\dlfiles\\...`), which is consistent with legitimate app behavior. This directory is likely used for **downloading game content, advertisements, or updates**.\n  \n- **File Types**:  \n  - **JavaScript files** (e.g., `waterfallconfig_v2.js`, `videowaterfallconfig.js`) suggest interaction with **advertisement networks** (common in free apps).\n  - **Archive files** (e.g., `*.archive`) may contain **compressed game assets, skins, or DLC** (e.g., \"world20132423062426_pack\").\n  - **Timestamps and random strings** in filenames (e.g., `20132423062426`) may indicate versioning or unique content identifiers.\n\n- **Purpose**:  \n  The app likely downloads **additional game packs, advertisements, or updates** to enhance user experience or monetize the application.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Concerns (If Not Confirmed Legitimate)**\nWhile the activity appears normal for the Solitaire app, the following points warrant further investigation:\n- **Unusual Volume of Files**:  \n  The large number of files (especially `.archive` files) could indicate **excessive data downloads** or **unintended behavior** (e.g., a compromised app).\n  \n- **Ad-Related Activity**:  \n  The presence of `advertisement` folders and ad config files may be expected for a free app, but **unexpected ad networks or tracking mechanisms** could be a red flag.\n\n- **Malware Risk**:  \n  If `Solitaire.exe` is **not the legitimate Microsoft executable** (e.g., replaced by malware), this activity could be **malicious** (e.g., downloading payloads or exfiltrating data). Verify the app's **digital signature** and **source**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendations**\n- **Verify Legitimacy of `Solitaire.exe`**:\n  - Check the file's **digital signature** (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures).\n  - Confirm it is installed from the **Microsoft Store** or official Microsoft channels.\n\n- **Scan for Malware**:\n  - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender** or a trusted antivirus tool to rule out malware.\n\n- **Monitor Network Activity**:\n  - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Process Monitor** to inspect network requests and ensure they are directed to legitimate Microsoft domains.\n\n- **Check for Updates**:\n  - Ensure the app is up to date (via Microsoft Store) to prevent vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe file creation activity is **likely legitimate** for the Microsoft Solitaire Collection, as it aligns with expected behavior for an app that uses advertisements and downloadable content. However, **verification of the app's authenticity and monitoring for unusual activity** is recommended to ensure no malicious processes are masquerading as the legitimate app."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there's a bunch of file creation events all under the Microsoft Solitaire Collection app. The process involved is \"Solitaire.exe\" each time. The files are being created in the AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\cache\\dlfiles\\globaldata directory. The filenames have different parts like \"world2013...\" and \"worldevent25th_pack\" with some hexadecimal hashes.\n\nHmm, first thought: these files might be part of the game's normal operations. Maybe they're downloading content, like new levels, ads, or updates. The fact that they're in the cache and dlfiles suggests they could be temporary files or assets being loaded. But why so many? Could this be related to an exploit or malware? Well, the process is Solitaire.exe, which is a legitimate Microsoft app. However, sometimes malicious software can masquerade as legitimate processes. But given that the files are in the expected cache directory and the process is Solitaire, it's more likely part of the app's normal behavior.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames include dates like \"2013\" and \"20130725\" which might be version numbers or timestamps. The hexadecimal parts could be unique identifiers for different assets. The presence of \"advertisement\" and \"staticadconfig.js\" suggests that the game is loading ad configurations, which is normal for free games. Similarly, \"videoadsconfig.js\" would be related to video ads.\n\nBut wait, if this is all normal, why are these logs flagged? Maybe the user is concerned because there's a high volume of file creations. However, if the app is regularly updating its content or downloading new assets, this could be expected. Also, the fact that all the files are being created by the same process and in a specific directory adds to the likelihood that it's legitimate.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues with the Microsoft Solitaire Collection app. Maybe there's a bug where it's creating too many files, but I don't recall hearing about that. Alternatively, it could be part of a feature like daily challenges or events that require downloading new content each time. The \"worldevent25th_pack\" might be related to a specific event, which would explain the creation of those files.\n\nAnother consideration: the files are in the LocalState directory, which is typically used for temporary data. So, they might be temporary files that are created and then deleted, but if they're being kept, that could be an issue. However, without seeing deletion events, it's hard to tell. The logs only show creation, not deletion.\n\nAlso, the user might be using a security tool that's flagging this activity as suspicious. But given the context, it's more likely a false positive. Unless there's other suspicious activity (like network connections to unknown servers, unexpected processes, etc.), this seems normal.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there's additional evidence pointing to malicious activity, these file creations are probably part of the app's normal operations, such as downloading game content, ads, or updates.\n<\/think>\n\nThe file creation events logged under **Microsoft Solitaire Collection** (via `Solitaire.exe`) are **likely legitimate** and part of the app's normal operations. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:\n   - The process `Solitaire.exe` is a **trusted Microsoft application**. Malware typically avoids using well-known system processes unless it's specifically designed to mimic them (which is less common in this case).\n\n2. **File Locations and Structure**:\n   - Files are created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\cache\\dlfiles\\globaldata`** directory, which is a **standard location for temporary or cached data** in Windows apps.\n   - Filenames like `world2013...`, `worldevent25th_pack`, and `staticadconfig.js` suggest they are **game assets, ad configurations, or event-specific content**.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Files**:\n   - **Ad-related files** (e.g., `staticadconfig.js`, `videoadsconfig.js`) are **common in free-to-play games** to manage advertisements.\n   - **World\/event packs** (e.g., `world2013...`, `worldevent25th_pack`) likely correspond to **game updates, new levels, or seasonal events** (e.g., a 25th-anniversary event).\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Identifiers**:\n   - The hex strings in filenames (e.g., `dd764ac0f9f9ef24e33062fb35...`) may serve as **unique identifiers for specific assets**, ensuring they are not duplicated or overwritten.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Likely Normal Behavior**\n- **Content Updates**: The app may be downloading **new game content**, such as levels, themes, or events (e.g., \"worldevent25th_pack\").\n- **Ad Management**: Files like `staticadconfig.js` are used to **configure and display ads**, which is standard for free apps.\n- **Caching**: The `cache` directory is used to store **temporary files** for faster access, which is typical for apps that stream assets or update dynamically.\n\n---\n\n### **Red Flags (If Any)**\n- **No Red Flags Detected**: The logs only show **file creation events**, not suspicious network activity, unexpected processes, or deletions of system files.\n- **False Positives**: Security tools may flag high-volume file creation as suspicious, but this is **common for apps with dynamic content**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Monitor for Other Suspicious Activity**:\n   - Check if the app is communicating with **unusual domains** or generating **unexplained network traffic**.\n   - Look for **unexpected processes** running alongside `Solitaire.exe`.\n\n2. **Verify App Integrity**:\n   - Ensure the app is **up to date** (via Microsoft Store).\n   - If unsure, run a **full system scan** with trusted antivirus software.\n\n3. **User Experience**:\n   - If the app is behaving oddly (e.g., high resource usage, unexpected ads), consider **reinstalling** the app or contacting Microsoft support.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe file creations are **most likely legitimate**, related to **normal app operations** like content updates, ad management, and caching. No immediate signs of malware or malicious activity are evident. If you're still concerned, further investigation into network traffic or app behavior would be warranted."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user provided a list of system events, mostly file creation events and a DNS query, all associated with a process named \"Solitaire.exe\". The question is probably asking whether this is a normal behavior or if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Solitaire.exe is. Microsoft Solitaire is a legitimate game that comes pre-installed on Windows. However, just because the process name is \"Solitaire.exe\" doesn't necessarily mean it's the genuine one. Malware often uses common process names to avoid detection. So, the first thing to check is whether the actual executable path is legitimate. The paths mentioned here are under \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\...\" which seems a bit odd. Wait, the file paths in the events are under \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\" which is typically used for caching internet files. That's unusual for a game like Solitaire, which is usually installed in the Program Files directory or via the Microsoft Store.\n\nNext, looking at the file names. Many of them have names like \"taboolaconfig_v2.js\" or \"vungleconfig.js\". These look like configuration files for ad networks. That's strange because Solitaire is a game, but if it's using these ad networks, that might be part of the game's monetization. However, the presence of multiple files with .js extensions in the INetCache directory could indicate that the game is downloading and executing external scripts, which might be a red flag. Ad networks are common in free games, but the way they're being handled here might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's the DNS query event. The process Solitaire.exe is making a DNS query. Normally, a game might communicate with servers for updates or multiplayer features, but again, the context here is important. If the DNS query is going to a known malicious domain or something unexpected, that's a problem. However, the user hasn't provided the specific domain queried, so I can't comment on that part directly.\n\nAnother point is the number of files being created. There are multiple entries for Solitaire.exe creating various .js files and archive files (.archive). This could be normal if the game is updating its assets or loading content dynamically. However, the volume and the locations might be unusual. The INetCache is for temporary internet files, so having a game create files there might be a sign that it's downloading content on the fly, which could be legitimate or a sign of data exfiltration.\n\nAlso, the process name \"Solitaire.exe\" is a common name, but if the actual executable is not in the expected location, that's a red flag. The user didn't provide the full path, but the AppData directory is user-specific and can be modified by the user or malicious software. If the executable is in a different location, like in the Temp folder or a user's AppData, that's suspicious.\n\nAnother angle is the presence of ad-related configuration files. If the game is using multiple ad networks, that's not uncommon, but if those configurations are being downloaded from the internet, that could be a way for malware to inject ads or track user behavior. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just a legitimate game with aggressive monetization.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user is running a legitimate version of Solitaire that does these things. But the combination of the file locations, the types of files being created, and the DNS query might be indicative of something more sinister. It's also possible that the user is using a third-party version of Solitaire that includes adware.\n\nIn summary, the key points to consider are:\n- The location of the executable and the files being created.\n- The types of files (ad-related JS files, archives).\n- The DNS query activity.\n- Whether the behavior is consistent with a legitimate game or more aligned with malware.\n\nGiven that the files are in the INetCache and involve ad-related configurations, it's possible that this is a legitimate game with ad integration, but the behavior is atypical and warrants further investigation. The user should verify the authenticity of the Solitaire installation, check for any unexpected processes, and possibly run a malware scan.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **Solitaire.exe** process creating numerous files in the **AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache** directory and performing a DNS query. While **Solitaire.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft game, the behavior observed raises **red flags** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual File Locations**\n- **AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache** is typically used for **caching internet files** (e.g., web content, ads, or temporary downloads). \n- **Solitaire.exe** is a local application, not a web-based tool, so creating files in this directory is **unusual**. Legitimate games typically store assets in **Program Files**, **AppData\\Roaming**, or **user-specific directories** for game data, not the INetCache.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ad-Related Files**\n- The files created (e.g., `taboolaconfig_v2.js`, `vungleconfig.js`) are **ad network configuration files** (e.g., **Taboola**, **Vungle**). These are commonly used in **freemium apps** for monetization but are **not standard for a core game like Solitaire**.\n- **Legitimate games** may use ad networks, but the **volume and type of files** (especially `.js` and `.archive` files) suggest **dynamic content loading** or **external script execution**. This could indicate:\n  - **Aggressive monetization** (e.g., in-game ads).\n  - **Malicious behavior** (e.g., downloading and executing external scripts for data exfiltration or tracking).\n\n---\n\n### **3. DNS Query Activity**\n- A **DNS query** from **Solitaire.exe** could be normal if the game communicates with servers (e.g., for updates, multiplayer, or analytics). However:\n  - **No domain information** is provided, so we cannot assess if the query is to a **legitimate** or **suspicious** endpoint.\n  - If the DNS query points to **unrelated domains** (e.g., ad networks, unknown servers), it could signal **malicious activity** (e.g., **C2 communication** or **data exfiltration**).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **File paths** in **INetCache** suggest **temporary internet file caching**, which is **inconsistent** with a local application like Solitaire.\n- **Multiple `.js` and `.archive` files** may indicate **dynamic content loading** or **external script execution**, which could be **malware-related** if not explicitly documented by the game developer.\n- **Unusual process behavior** (e.g., file creation in INetCache, ad-related files) could signal **tampering** with the original Solitaire installation (e.g., **malware masquerading as the game**).\n\n---\n\n### **5. What to Do Next?**\n- **Verify the Solitaire installation**:\n  - Check the **executable's digital signature** (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures). Legitimate Microsoft games are signed by Microsoft.\n  - Confirm the **installation path** is in **Program Files** or **Microsoft Store** (not AppData or Temp).\n- **Scan for malware**:\n  - Use **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to scan the system for suspicious files or processes.\n  - Check for **unexpected processes** with the same name (e.g., multiple \"Solitaire.exe\" instances).\n- **Monitor network activity**:\n  - Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Microsoft Network Monitor** to inspect the DNS query and any outgoing traffic from Solitaire.exe.\n- **Check for adware**:\n  - Use **AdwCleaner** or **Malwarebytes Adware Removal Tool** to detect and remove ad-related components.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **Solitaire.exe** is a legitimate application, the **unusual file locations**, **ad-related files**, and **DNS query** suggest **potential tampering** or **malware masquerading as the game**. This behavior is **not typical** of the official Microsoft Solitaire and warrants **immediate investigation** to ensure the system is secure."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195700.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. So, there are several file creation events. The first one is from winlogbeat.exe, which is a common tool for collecting logs. The path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal if someone is setting up the tool. Then there are multiple entries from Solitaire.exe creating files in the AppData directory under Microsoft Solitaire Collection. These paths look like they're part of the game's cache or theme files. The filenames include things like 'howtoplayscreens' and 'themes_standard', which seem legitimate for a game.\n\nBut wait, why are there multiple file creations from Solitaire.exe? Maybe it's just the game updating its resources. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity. The other event is a registry value set by RuntimeBroker.exe, which is a normal process for managing permissions. No obvious malicious activity here.\n\nThe key point is whether these file creations are part of normal operations. Winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file is likely part of its configuration setup. Solitaire's files are in expected locations. No suspicious paths or processes. No signs of malware or unauthorized access. So, maybe this isn't interesting. But I need to be sure. Since all events are from known processes and in standard directories, it's probably not worth investigating further. Confidence is around 0.3 because there's no clear threat, but maybe the repetition of Solitaire's file creation could be a red flag.
