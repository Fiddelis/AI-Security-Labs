Then there's an image loaded for the same executable. Then, Update.exe is created in the SquirrelTemp directory. Squirrel is a framework used for updating applications, so this might be part of a legitimate update process. \n\nLooking further, Update.exe is loading several .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard .NET components, so that's probably normal.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user is asking whether this batch of events is interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are related to Discord.exe and Update.exe. The processes are performing normal activities like creating pipes, loading images, and process creation. The paths mentioned are typical for Discord's installation directory, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\app-1.0.9190\\. That seems legitimate.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a process for Update.exe that's creating a shortcut for Discord.exe. The command line arguments include --createShortcut, which is a normal part of updating software. The paths to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are standard system files, so loading those doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries for Image Load events, which is normal during process execution. The same DLLs are being loaded repeatedly, which might be part of the application's normal operation. Also, the Pipe Created events are common in communication between different processes or services, especially in applications like Discord that might use named pipes for inter-process communication.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any unusual behavior. For example, any unexpected network activity, unusual file access, or unexpected processes. But in these logs, everything seems to be within the expected scope of Discord's operations. There's no mention of unexpected processes, unauthorized access, or any errors that might indicate a problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the number of events. There are a lot of entries, but that's probably because the application is actively running and performing various tasks. The repetition of certain events, like Image Load for the same DLLs, is normal during application startup and operation.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. The processes are legitimate, the files accessed are standard, and the activities described are typical for a running application. Unless there's an external indicator that these processes are malicious, which isn't present here, these logs don't show anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events described appears to represent **normal operational activity** associated with the **Discord application and its updater (Update.exe)**. Here's a structured analysis of why this is likely benign and not indicative of a security threat:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Analysis**\n1. **Legitimate Processes and Paths**:\n   - **Discord.exe** and **Update.exe** are legitimate components of the Discord application. The file paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\app-1.0.9190\\...`) align with standard Discord installation directories.\n   - **.NET DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) are standard system files used by .NET applications during execution. Their loading is expected in the context of `Update.exe`.\n\n2. **Expected Behavior**:\n   - **Image Load Events**: Multiple entries for `Discord.exe` and `Update.exe` loading DLLs (e.g., `ffmpeg.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`) are typical during application startup, execution, and inter-process communication.\n   - **Pipe Creation Events**: Named pipes (`PipeEvent`) are commonly used by applications like Discord for **inter-process communication (IPC)**, especially for GPU processes, rendering, or internal messaging.\n\n3. **Command-Line Arguments**:\n   - The `--type=gpu-process` and `--type=renderer` flags in `Discord.exe` are standard for Chrome-based applications (Discord uses Chromium) to spawn GPU or renderer threads.\n   - The `Update.exe` command line (`--createShortcut`) is consistent with legitimate update operations, such as creating shortcuts for the application.\n\n4. **No Suspicious Indicators**:\n   - **No unexpected file paths**: All file paths are within standard system or application directories.\n   - **No unusual network activity**: The logs do not mention network connections, DNS queries, or external communication (which would be required for malware or data exfiltration).\n   - **No errors or anomalies**: The logs reflect routine process creation, DLL loading, and IPC, with no signs of crashes, unexpected termination, or privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events does **not** indicate malicious activity. The observed behavior aligns with the **normal operation of Discord and its updater**, including:\n- Application startup and rendering processes.\n- .NET-based updates and shortcut creation.\n- Inter-process communication via named pipes.\n\n**No further investigation is warranted** unless additional context (e.g., unexpected network behavior, unauthorized access, or user-reported issues) is available."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: Discord.exe is being created with a long command line. That's normal for a process start, but maybe the command line has some unusual parameters? Let me check. The command line includes things like --type=utility and some sandboxing options. Hmm, not sure if that's suspicious yet. Maybe part of the normal operation.\n\nThen there are multiple ProcessAccess events for Discord.exe. That's common when processes interact with each other, but not necessarily malicious. Then ImageLoad events for Discord.exe loading DLLs like ffmpeg.dll, d3dcompiler_47.dll, and libGLESv2.dll. Those are typical for a Discord application, which might use media codecs and graphics libraries. So far, nothing too suspicious.\n\nNow, looking at the Update.exe entries. There are several FileCreate events for Discord.lnk shortcuts in different locations, like the Start Menu and the Desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but if done in large numbers or in unusual places, it could be a sign of something. However, in this case, it's just creating a few shortcuts. Then there are a lot of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. That's a bit odd because Update.exe is typically associated with software updates, but if it's being accessed repeatedly, maybe it's part of a legitimate update process or could be a red flag.\n\nWait, but why so many ProcessAccess events for Update.exe? Let me count. There are 19 entries for Update.exe with ProcessAccess. That seems excessive. Normally, a process would be accessed a few times, but 19 times in a short period might indicate some unusual activity. Maybe the process is being manipulated or is part of a malware's persistence mechanism.\n\nAlso, the creation of multiple shortcuts (Discord.lnk) in different locations might be an attempt to create persistence or to trick users into launching the application from different places. However, without more context, like if these shortcuts are pointing to malicious files or if there's other suspicious activity, it's hard to tell. But the sheer number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe raises a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Update.exe is not a standard Windows process. It's more commonly associated with third-party software updates. If this is part of a legitimate update process, then maybe it's okay. But if there's no corresponding legitimate software or if the user hasn't initiated an update, that could be a problem.\n\nI should also check for any other anomalies. The initial Discord.exe process seems normal, but the repeated access of Update.exe might be indicative of something. Maybe the Update.exe is being used to perform actions that shouldn't be happening, like modifying files or registry entries. However, the logs provided don't show those details.\n\nIn conclusion, while some events are normal for a running application, the high number of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe and the creation of multiple shortcuts might be worth investigating further. It's not definitively malicious, but it's suspicious enough to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown and analysis:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n1. **Discord.exe Process Initialization**:\n   - The initial `Discord.exe` process with a long command line is typical for legitimate applications. Parameters like `--type=utility` and sandboxing flags are consistent with standard application behavior (e.g., running in a sandboxed environment for security).\n\n2. **Image Load Events**:\n   - Loading DLLs such as `ffmpeg.dll`, `d3dcompiler_47.dll`, and `libGLESv2.dll` is expected for a Discord client, which uses media codecs and graphics libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Excessive `ProcessAccess` Events for `Update.exe`**:\n   - **19 instances** of `ProcessAccess` for `Update.exe` in a short timeframe are highly unusual. Legitimate processes typically do not trigger such a high volume of access events unless explicitly interacting with other components. This could indicate:\n     - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., malware attempting to maintain access).\n     - **Unusual process behavior** (e.g., `Update.exe` being hijacked or used for lateral movement).\n\n2. **Creation of Multiple Shortcuts**:\n   - **Multiple `FileCreate` events** for `Discord.lnk` in different locations (e.g., Desktop, Start Menu) could be:\n     - **Legitimate**: If part of a software update or user-initiated action.\n     - **Suspicious**: If the shortcuts point to malicious binaries or are created without user consent (e.g., part of a persistence or social engineering attempt).\n\n3. **Absence of Clear Legitimacy for `Update.exe`**:\n   - `Update.exe` is not a standard Windows process. If this is not tied to a known, legitimate update tool (e.g., Discord's own updater), it raises concerns about potential **malware伪装** (masquerading as an updater).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Investigate `Update.exe`**:\n  - Verify its digital signature, file hash, and origin.\n  - Check if it is part of a legitimate update process (e.g., Discord's official updater).\n  - Monitor for additional suspicious behavior (e.g., network connections, registry modifications).\n\n- **Audit Shortcut Files**:\n  - Check the targets of the created `Discord.lnk` shortcuts to ensure they point to legitimate binaries.\n  - Look for signs of user coercion (e.g., unexpected shortcuts on the Desktop).\n\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n  - Cross-reference with network logs, registry changes, or user activity to determine if `Update.exe` is part of a larger malicious campaign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Discord process initialization) is normal, the **excessive `ProcessAccess` events for `Update.exe`** and **unusual shortcut creation** warrant further investigation. These could indicate **malicious behavior**, but confirmation requires deeper analysis of the `Update.exe` binary and associated artifacts. **This batch is suspicious and should be prioritized for investigation.**"}

So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries about Discord.exe loading DLLs like libEGL.dll, vulkan-1.dll, and vk_swiftshader.dll. These are legitimate files that Discord might use for graphics, so that's normal. But then there's an entry where Update.exe is creating a shortcut file in the Start Menu and on the desktop. Creating shortcuts isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious.\n\nNext, there are a bunch of ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. That's a lot of them. Repeated process access could indicate something trying to interact with the process, maybe for malicious purposes. Then, there's the reg.exe process adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to launch Update.exe with a parameter to start Discord.exe. That's a classic sign of persistence, which is a red flag. Malware often adds itself to the registry so it runs on startup.\n\nAlso, another reg.exe event adds a registry entry under Software\\Classes for a Discord protocol. That might be related to handling URLs, but if it's not expected, it could be part of a malicious setup. The fact that Update.exe is creating these registry entries and the shortcuts, combined with the multiple ProcessAccess events, suggests that something is trying to establish persistence and possibly manipulate the system.\n\nThe Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal, but when combined with the other suspicious activities, they could indicate communication between processes. However, the main red flags here are the registry modifications and the repeated process access. The presence of Update.exe, which is not typically a standard Windows process, and its actions, makes me think this is a potential malicious activity. \n\nI should check if all these events are part of a legitimate update process. But given that there's no mention of a legitimate update, and the actions taken (registry changes, creating shortcuts, multiple process accesses), it's more likely to be suspicious. The confidence here would be around 0.8 because the combination of events points to persistence and possible malicious behavior, but without more data, it's not 100% certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Update.exe creates shortcuts and modifies registry for persistence (HKCU\\\\Run entry). 2) reg.exe adds custom protocol handler (Discord protocol). 3) Excessive ProcessAccess events for Update.exe. 4) Discord.exe creates multiple named pipes which could indicate inter-process communication or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to Discord.exe. There are several instances of \"Pipe Created\" events, which might be normal if Discord is communicating through named pipes. But then there are some reg.exe commands modifying the registry under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. That's a red flag. Modifying registry entries related to how applications are handled can be part of malware trying to change default behaviors or set up shortcuts.\n\nLooking at the specific reg commands: adding \"URL Protocol\" and setting the default icon and command for Discord. That seems like it's configuring Discord to handle URLs, which might be legitimate, but combined with other events, it could be suspicious. Also, there's an Update.exe process involved, which is part of the Squirrel framework used by some applications for updates. However, the FileCreate event for a Discord.lnk shortcut in the Start Menu might be normal during installation, but the repeated ProcessAccess events on Update.exe could indicate something else.\n\nThen there's the ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. Ffmpeg is a media tool, but if it's being loaded by Discord, maybe that's normal. However, if it's being loaded from a non-standard path or if there are unexpected files, that's a problem. But in this case, the path seems to be the standard app directory.\n\nThe ProcessTerminate events for Discord.exe are normal if the application is closing. However, the combination of registry changes, multiple process creations, and the involvement of Update.exe might suggest a setup or update process. But since the user is asking if it's interesting for investigation, I need to check if there's any malicious activity.\n\nThe key points are the registry modifications and the use of reg.exe. Legitimate software can modify the registry, but when combined with multiple process creations and accesses, it might be part of a larger operation. However, without more context like unexpected network activity, file modifications, or unusual command-line arguments, it's hard to say for sure. But the presence of reg.exe adding registry keys related to Discord's URL handling and the creation of a shortcut could be part of a legitimate installation. However, the repetition of events and the involvement of Update.exe might indicate a more complex process, possibly a setup that's being monitored.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"malicious behavior.\" The events here don't show obvious signs like file deletions, network connections to suspicious IPs, or execution of unknown binaries. The registry changes are related to application associations, which is normal for some applications. However, the fact that reg.exe is being used multiple times to modify these keys might be part of a legitimate update process. The presence of Update.exe could be part of the Squirrel update framework, which is used by some applications for updates. So, maybe this is just a normal update or installation process.\n\nBut then again, the repeated ProcessAccess events on Update.exe and the multiple Pipe Created events for Discord.exe might be normal. However, the classification here is tricky. If all the events are part of a legitimate software update, then it's not interesting. But if the registry modifications are part of something more malicious, like changing the default application for certain protocols, that could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The justification would need to weigh the potential legitimate use against the possible malicious intent. Since the user is asking for an investigation, the presence of these events might warrant further examination, even if they aren't outright malicious. So, the answer might be that it's somewhat suspicious but not definitively malicious, hence requiring further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows a mix of normal application behavior and potential indicators of interest that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Software Activity:**\n   - **Discord.exe** and **Update.exe** are associated with Discord's installation\/update process, which is common for applications using frameworks like Squirrel.\n   - **FileCreate** for `Discord.lnk` in the Start Menu is typical during installation.\n   - **ImageLoad** events for `ffmpeg.dll` (used by Discord for media processing) are likely legitimate.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **`reg.exe`** is used to modify registry keys under `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord`, such as:\n     - Adding `URL Protocol` (common for applications handling custom URLs).\n     - Setting the default icon and command for Discord (normal for setting up application associations).\n   - These changes are **not inherently malicious**, but **registry modifications** can be exploited by malware to persist or alter system behavior.\n\n3. **Unusual Patterns:**\n   - **Repeated `ProcessAccess` events** on **Update.exe** (4 instances) may indicate monitoring or interaction with the update process, which could be normal or suspicious depending on context.\n   - **Multiple `Pipe Created` events** for **Discord.exe** could indicate inter-process communication, which is common but may be leveraged by malware for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) if not properly secured.\n\n4. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No evidence of **file deletions, network connections to suspicious IPs, or execution of unknown binaries**.\n   - The **`ffmpeg.dll`** path appears legitimate (user-specific app directory).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but they contain **potential red flags** (e.g., registry modifications, repeated process access) that could warrant further investigation. A deeper analysis (e.g., correlating with network activity, checking for unexpected binaries, or reviewing system behavior post-event) is recommended to rule out compromise. \n\n**Classification:** **Suspicious but not conclusive** — merits closer examination."}

But then there's one event where \"Update.exe\" created a file called \"Discord.lnk\" on the desktop. That seems odd because .lnk files are shortcuts, and creating one might be part of a malicious activity, like setting up a shortcut to a malicious file. However, just creating a shortcut isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other actions, it could be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there are events related to Discord.exe. The command line for one of the Discord processes has a URL that's \"https:\/\/f.a.k\/e\". That's a suspicious domain, possibly a typo or a fake URL. Also, there are multiple ImageLoad events for Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll. While Discord does use ffmpeg, the presence of multiple image loads might be normal, but if there's an unexpected DLL, that could be an issue. However, in this case, the paths seem legitimate.\n\nThere's also a Registry value set event, which could indicate changes to the system's configuration.

But I notice that there are also two entries involving reg.exe. The first one is adding a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with the value \"URL:Discord Protocol\". The second reg.exe command adds \"URL Protocol\" under the same key. That seems suspicious because modifying the registry, especially under the Classes key, can be part of setting up a protocol handler. That's not unusual for legitimate software, but when combined with other activities, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the Discord.exe process, there's a command line that includes a long string with various flags. Some of these flags are typical for applications, but the presence of --disable-features with a long list might indicate that the application is configured in a way that bypasses certain security features. Also, the path to the executable is in the AppData directory, which is common for user-installed applications. However, the fact that there are multiple \"Process accessed\" events could indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed more than normal, but that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother point is the Image loaded events. One of them points to ffmpeg.dll. If this is a legitimate version of ffmpeg, it's okay, but if it's a modified or malicious version, that could be an issue.

That seems normal because applications often set their icons in the registry. But then there are multiple entries for Discord.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, PipeCreated, NetworkConnect, and DnsQuery. \n\nWait, there are several Pipe Created events. Creating multiple pipes might be normal for inter-process communication, but if there's an unusual number, that could be a red flag. Also, the registry modifications by reg.exe are part of the setup, but when combined with the network activity, maybe that's suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for Discord.exe, there's a --type=utility and --utility-sub-type=unzip.mojom.Unzipper.

Also, the presence of multiple network connections and DNS queries could indicate communication with external servers, which is normal for Discord, but maybe there's something unusual here.\n\nThere's also an image loaded event for ffmpeg.dll. That's a media library, so maybe Discord uses it for video, but again, could be part of normal operations. However, the File Executable Detected event points to a Widevine CDM DLL in the Temp folder. That's a digital rights management component, which might be legitimate, but if it's being executed from the Temp directory, that might be a concern.\n\nPutting it all together, the events seem to be a mix of normal Discord operations and some registry changes.

Maybe the answer is that it's not interesting because these are normal activities for Discord. Alternatively, the high volume of events might be a red flag. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that while some events are normal, the combination might not be sufficient to flag as suspicious.

If all the events are from a legitimate process and there's no indication of malicious activity, like unexpected file modifications, unusual registry changes, or connections to suspicious IPs, then it might not be interesting. However, the fact that there are multiple network connections might be worth looking into, but since the process is known and the events are all from the same application, it might not be a red flag.\n\nBut the presence of \"Registry value set\" could be a hint. However, if that's part of Discord's normal operations, like setting some configuration, then it's not necessarily bad. The \"Process terminated\" event might be normal if the application is closing properly. \n\nOn the other hand, if there are no other suspicious activities, like high volume of connections, or connections to known malicious IPs, then this might just be normal behavior. Since the user hasn't provided any other context, like other processes or anomalies, it's hard to say. But based solely on these logs, since all are from a legitimate application and no obvious malicious activity is present, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\". However, the repeated network connections could be a red flag, but without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe the confidence is moderate, like 0.5, but I need to check the justification again.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to consider the combination of all events. If all are from Discord and the events are normal for it, then it's not interesting. But if there's something unusual, like too many connections in a short time, but the logs don't specify timestamps. Without timestamps, the frequency can't be assessed. So, the answer would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because all events are from a legitimate process and there's no clear malicious activity. However, the presence of multiple network connections might be a point of interest, but since it's Discord, which is expected to have such connections, it's probably normal. So the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7, but maybe lower if the user is concerned about Discord's behavior. But according to the logs alone, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are related to legitimate Discord.exe process activities (network connections, process termination, registry changes), which are expected for a normal application. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
