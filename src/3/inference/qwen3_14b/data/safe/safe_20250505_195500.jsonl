{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries from what seems to be a system or application log. The main thing here is that there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in a specific directory under the user's AppData folder. The files all have names that start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters and a .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is a component related to Microsoft Office, specifically part of the Office Click-to-Run deployment. It's involved in installing and updating Office applications. So, if this process is running, it's probably part of an Office installation or update.\n\nNow, looking at the file names: they all have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be related to some localization or string resources for Office. The \".min\" suggests it's a minified JavaScript file, which is common in web applications. However, Office typically uses its own resource files, not JavaScript. This might be part of a web component or an add-in, maybe something related to the Office web apps or a third-party integration.\n\nThe fact that these files are being created multiple times, with different hexadecimal hashes, could indicate that each file is a different version or part of a larger package. The repetition of the same file names with different hashes might be part of a deployment process where multiple files are being placed in the directory. However, the same file being created multiple times could also be a red flag if it's unexpected, but in the context of an Office update, it might be normal.\n\nAnother thing to note is the directory path: \"AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\ClickToRun\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Office16\" which is a known path for Office Click-to-Run installations. This further supports the idea that these files are part of an Office update or installation process.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity. The files are being created by a legitimate process (SDXHelper), and the directory is a standard one for Office. The file names, while unusual, don't immediately look like malware. Malware often uses more generic names or hides in unexpected directories. But since the user is asking if this is suspicious, I should consider that even legitimate processes can sometimes be involved in unexpected activities.\n\nAnother angle: the creation of so many files with similar names might be part of a larger update package. Each file could be a different component or language pack. The repetition of the same file name with different hashes could be part of the same update, but with different checksums for each version. However, if the user is not performing an Office update, this might be unexpected.\n\nI should also consider if the user has recently installed or updated Office. If so, this could be normal. But if not, then it might be worth investigating further. However, based solely on the logs provided, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The process is legitimate, the directory is correct, and the files seem to be part of a standard Office operation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the logs show multiple file creations, they are likely part of a legitimate Office update process. The user should check if they've recently updated Office, and if not, ensure that their system is secure. But based on the information given, there's no immediate indication of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs you provided show repeated file creation events by the **`SDXHelper.exe`** process, which is a legitimate component of **Microsoft Office Click-to-Run** (used for installing\/updating Office applications). Here's the breakdown and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Context**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is part of Microsoft Office's Click-to-Run deployment system. It is responsible for installing, updating, and managing Office applications.\n   - The files are created in the directory:  \n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\ClickToRun\\OfficeClickToRun\\Office16\\Setup\\Office16\n     ```\n     This is a standard path for Office Click-to-Run operations.\n\n2. **File Names**:\n   - Files like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hex>.js` suggest they are **minified JavaScript files** (common in web applications) with unique hex hashes. These could be:\n     - **Localization\/resource files** for Office (e.g., for web-based components or add-ins).\n     - **Temporary files** during an Office update or installation.\n   - The repetition of similar file names with different hex hashes may indicate multiple components or language packs being deployed.\n\n3. **Legitimacy**:\n   - **No evidence of malware** is present in the logs. The process (`SDXHelper.exe`) and directory are associated with legitimate Office operations.\n   - The file names, while unusual, are not inherently suspicious (e.g., no generic names like `random.exe` or `malware.js`).\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Scenarios**\n- **Office Update\/Installation**:  \n  If you recently installed or updated Microsoft Office (especially via Click-to-Run), these files are likely part of the update process. The hex hashes may correspond to different versions or components.\n\n- **Web Components\/Office Add-ins**:  \n  The `.min.js` extension suggests these files might be used by Office web apps (e.g., Excel Online, Word Online) or third-party add-ins requiring JavaScript resources.\n\n- **Normal Operation**:  \n  The repeated file creation is typical during deployments, as Click-to-Run may generate temporary files for each component being installed.\n\n---\n\n### **When to Investigate Further**\n- If you **did not initiate an Office update** and these events are unexpected.\n- If you notice **unusual system behavior** (e.g., high CPU usage, unknown network activity).\n- If **antivirus\/malware scanners flag these files** as suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Confirm Office Activity**:  \n   Check if you recently installed\/updated Office. If not, ensure the update is legitimate.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:  \n   Use tools like **Task Manager** or **Process Explorer** to confirm `SDXHelper.exe` is not behaving abnormally (e.g., high resource usage, unexpected network connections).\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:  \n   Run a full system scan with your antivirus software to rule out malware impersonating legitimate processes.\n\n4. **Check File Integrity**:  \n   If concerned, verify the files' digital signatures (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures) to ensure they are signed by Microsoft.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs are **likely legitimate** and part of a normal Office update or installation process. However, if you are unsure about the context or notice anomalies, further investigation is warranted."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. The user provided a list of log entries, all showing files being created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files are all JavaScript files (since they end with .js) and they're located in the Office application's resources directory. The filenames have a pattern with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes update their resources, so creating new JS files could be part of an update or localization process. However, the repetition of the same filenames multiple times might indicate something else. Wait, looking at the entries, each filename is listed multiple times. For example, \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_2e8895595f238811259691f33f822ecc.js\" appears twice. That's odd because typically, a file would be created once. Repeated creation could mean that the process is trying to overwrite the file or there's an error in the process.\n\nAlso, the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I should check if that's a legitimate process. SDXHelper might be part of a software's helper service, but I'm not sure. If it's a legitimate process, then maybe it's part of a normal operation. However, if it's a malicious process, the repeated file creation could be an indicator of something harmful, like generating files for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point is the location of the files: \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\en-US\\OfficeWebApps\". This path is under the Office application data, which is a common place for updates or temporary files. But again, the repetition might be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other processes involved. The log shows only SDXHelper.exe, but maybe there are other processes that aren't logged here. However, based on the given data, the main concern is the repeated creation of the same files. This could indicate a loop or an error in the application trying to write the files, which might be a sign of a bug or a malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while some file creation in Office's resource directories might be normal during updates, the repetition of the same files by the same process raises suspicion. It's worth checking if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and verifying if this behavior is part of a known update process or if it's an anomaly that could indicate malware.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries show repeated creation of JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) by the process `SDXHelper.exe` in the Microsoft Office resource directory. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation:**\n   - The same filenames (e.g., `min_2e8895595f238811259691f33f822ecc.js`) are logged multiple times, suggesting the process may be attempting to overwrite or repeatedly generate the same files. This is unusual for legitimate update or localization processes, which typically create files once.\n\n2. **Location and Context:**\n   - The files are stored in the Office application data directory (`C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\en-US\\OfficeWebApps`), a common location for temporary or update files. However, the repetitive behavior deviates from typical legitimate activity.\n\n3. **Process `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - While `SDXHelper.exe` may be a legitimate process (e.g., part of a software helper service), its repeated file creation here could indicate:\n     - **Malicious Activity:** If the process is not legitimate, this behavior might be part of persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or tampering.\n     - **Legitimate Bug:** A software flaw could cause the process to loop or erroneously recreate files.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Unusual Behavior:** Legitimate processes rarely overwrite the same file repeatedly in this manner without clear justification (e.g., incremental updates with unique filenames).\n- **Lack of Context:** No other processes or system events (e.g., updates, user actions) are mentioned, making it difficult to determine if this is part of a known operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check the process's digital signature and origin. Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan for malware.\n   - Ensure the process is associated with a trusted application (e.g., Microsoft Office, third-party software).\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n   - Investigate if similar behavior occurs during other system activities (e.g., Office updates, user logins).\n   - Check for unexpected changes in the Office resource directory.\n\n3. **System Health Check:**\n   - Run a full system scan for malware.\n   - Review Windows Event Viewer for related errors or warnings.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the file creation location aligns with Office resource management, the **repetitive generation of identical files** by `SDXHelper.exe` raises suspicion. This could indicate either a software bug or malicious activity. Further investigation into the legitimacy of the process and system behavior is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's PackageResources. Each entry has the same structure: the process name, the task \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses helper processes, but sometimes malware also uses similar names. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But looking at the file paths, they're all in the Office directory, which makes me think that maybe this is related to some Office add-in or update. However, the fact that there are so many files being created with different hashes (the long strings after \"min_\") might be a red flag. Legitimate software usually doesn't create that many files in such a short period, especially with unique names each time.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all the events are from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. If this is a legitimate process, it might be part of a software that's installing or updating, but typically, such operations would have more varied process names or be part of a known installer. Also, the repetition of the same file path structure but with different unique identifiers in the filenames could indicate that something is generating a lot of files, which might be a sign of malicious activity, like a dropper or a downloader.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that maybe this is part of a legitimate application's behavior. For example, some applications generate temporary files or cache files with unique names. But the key here is the number of files and the repetition. If this is a one-time event during an installation, it might be normal, but if it's happening repeatedly or in large numbers, it's suspicious.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate file. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that SDXHelper might be related to some software, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the fact that all these files are created in the Office directory, which is a protected system directory, adds to the suspicion. Legitimate software usually doesn't create files in such directories without proper installation procedures.\n\nAnother angle: the event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which is likely from a security tool or a monitoring system. The rule name suggests that this is part of a detection mechanism. If this is from a legitimate security tool, then the creation of these files might be part of a scan or a quarantine process. But again, the repetition and the number of files are concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's possible that this is a legitimate process, the high number of files created with unique names in a system directory by a process named SDXHelper.exe raises red flags. This could indicate potential malicious activity, such as a malware dropper or a keylogger. However, without more information or context, it's hard to be certain. The best course of action would be to check the reputation of SDXHelper.exe, look for any associated processes or services, and run a malware scan.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly creating files in the directory `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles` with filenames following a pattern like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation**:\n   - Over **16 entries** show the same process (`SDXHelper.exe`) creating files with unique hashes in the same directory.\n   - The filenames suggest JavaScript files (`*.js`) with obfuscated or randomized names (`min_<hash>`), which is common in **malware** to evade detection.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Name**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a well-known legitimate process. While some legitimate software may use similar names, the lack of broader context raises suspicion.\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - Files are created in the **Microsoft Office directory**, which is a protected system path. Legitimate processes typically avoid writing to such directories without explicit user consent.\n\n4. **Behavior**:\n   - The repeated creation of files with unique hashes could indicate **malware dropper behavior**, where payloads are generated dynamically or stored temporarily.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Activity**: The pattern resembles behavior seen in **malware** that generates obfuscated files to avoid detection (e.g., loaders, droppers, or persistence mechanisms).\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The files might be part of a **persistence strategy** (e.g., injecting code into legitimate processes or creating backdoors).\n- **Data Exfiltration**: If the files are being written with user-specific data, this could be **data exfiltration** or **logging** by malicious actors.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check Process Reputation**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **VirusTotal** to scan `SDXHelper.exe` for known malicious signatures.\n   - Verify if `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by a legitimate developer (check digital certificates).\n\n2. **Isolate and Analyze**:\n   - If `SDXHelper.exe` is not part of a known application, isolate the system and analyze the files using a sandbox or reverse-engineering tools.\n\n3. **System Integrity Check**:\n   - Run a full system scan for malware.\n   - Check for unexpected services, scheduled tasks, or registry modifications associated with `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Monitor network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` to detect potential communication with C2 servers.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs alone do not confirm malicious intent, the **unusual file creation pattern**, **untrusted process name**, and **location in a protected directory** strongly suggest **potential malware activity**. Immediate investigation and scanning are advised to mitigate risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by hash-like suffixes. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office, which is a common location for temporary files or updates. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of some software, but if it's creating a lot of files in that directory, that could be suspicious. Also, the fact that there are multiple file creations with different hashes might indicate that the process is generating or downloading files, which could be part of a malicious activity like downloading payloads or exfiltrating data.\n\nThen there are two entries from chrome.exe related to registry value sets. But Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry that much, so that might be a red flag too. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the main focus here is on SDXHelper.exe.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the files are named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" which might be a reference to some legitimate software, but the hash suffixes are not standard. Also, the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times could be an attempt to overwrite or replace files, which is suspicious.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application that's updating or installing something. But given that the files are in the Office directory and the process name isn't standard, it's more likely to be malicious. However, without checking the process's digital signature or further analysis, it's hard to be certain. But based on the logs provided, the pattern of multiple file creations by a non-standard process in a sensitive directory is concerning and would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n### 1. **Unusual File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**\n   - **Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` (non-standard, not a typical Windows process) repeatedly creates files in the directory:  \n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\n     ```\n   - **File Names**: Files are named with a pattern like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, suggesting:\n     - **Obfuscation**: The hash-like suffixes may be used to evade detection or mimic legitimate files.\n     - **Malicious Payloads**: The files could be malicious payloads, logs, or data being exfiltrated (e.g., stolen data encoded in filenames).\n\n### 2. **High Volume of File Creations**\n   - **Repetition**: The same file names are created multiple times (e.g., `min_5a5d966fb4bee84e88c268af3293257d.js` appears twice). This could indicate:\n     - **Overwriting\/Replacement**: Attempting to replace files or inject malicious content.\n     - **Data Exfiltration**: Repeated creation might suggest data being written to files for exfiltration.\n\n### 3. **Location of Files**\n   - **Office Directory**: The `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory is typically used by Microsoft Office for temporary files or updates. While not inherently malicious, **unauthorized activity here** (especially by non-Office processes) raises concerns.\n\n### 4. **Lack of Context for `SDXHelper.exe`**\n   - **No Standard Process**: `SDXHelper.exe` is not a known legitimate process in Microsoft ecosystems. Its presence without clear user context (e.g., no installed software named \"SDX\") is suspicious.\n\n### 5. **Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`**\n   - **Unusual Activity**: While `chrome.exe` is legitimate, **registry modifications** (e.g., `Registry value set`) could indicate:\n     - **Persistence Mechanisms**: Malware attempting to persist across reboots.\n     - **Tampering**: Unauthorized changes to Chrome's behavior or settings.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Check `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Verify its **digital signature** (if any) and **origin** (e.g., file system location, parent process).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze its behavior.\n\n2. **Analyze the Created Files**:\n   - Examine the contents of files like `min_5a5d966fb4bee84e88c268af3293257d.js` for malicious code (e.g., base64-encoded payloads, URLs, or obfuscated scripts).\n\n3. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate the **registry modifications** by `chrome.exe` for signs of persistence (e.g., startup entries, scheduled tasks).\n\n4. **Network Traffic**:\n   - Monitor network activity from `SDXHelper.exe` to detect communication with external servers (e.g., C2 servers).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **unusual process activity**, **repeated file creation in sensitive directories**, and **lack of context for `SDXHelper.exe`** strongly suggests **potential malicious activity**.

So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the same directory under the Office Package Resources. The filenames are all similar, starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a unique hash and ending with \".js\". \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, possibly related to the setup or updates. But I'm not entirely sure.

However, if these files are being created in the Office directory, maybe it's part of an add-in or some Office-related web component.\n\nNow, considering the number of files being created. There are 16 entries here, each with different hashes. That seems like a lot. If this is part of a legitimate process, would it generate so many files? Maybe during an update, but typically updates might replace files rather than create many new ones. Alternatively, if this is a malicious process, creating numerous files with unique hashes could be a way to hide malicious code or to obfuscate the payload.\n\nAnother thing to check is the process's legitimacy. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, then maybe this is normal. However, if the process is not genuine, it could be a malware masquerading as a legitimate process. But how can I verify that? Well, the user would need to check the process's digital signature, its location, and whether it's part of a known Microsoft product.\n\nAlso, the fact that all these files are being created in the same directory might indicate that the process is trying to inject or modify the Office environment. However, without more context, like the system's behavior, other logs, or whether the user is experiencing any issues, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut given that all the files are JavaScript and minified, and the process is SDXHelper, which is associated with Office, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate update or resource loading. However, the sheer number of files and the repetitive nature of the entries might be suspicious. Maybe it's a benign process, but it's also possible that this is part of a malicious activity, such as dropping payloads or preparing for further actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no immediate red flag, the high number of files created by what seems to be a legitimate process could warrant further investigation. Checking the process's authenticity, verifying the files' contents, and looking for other suspicious activities would be necessary steps.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is creating multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the **Microsoft Office** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Identity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is associated with **Microsoft Office** (specifically, it is part of the **Office Setup and Deployment** tools). It is a legitimate process used during Office installation, updates, or add-in management.\n\n2. **File Behavior**:\n   - The files created are **minified JavaScript** (`*.min.js`), which is common in web and application development for optimization.\n   - The filenames suggest they may be **localization\/resource files** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings` could relate to language-specific strings or UI components).\n\n3. **Quantity and Repetition**:\n   - **16 files** are logged, each with unique hashes. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate updates**: Office might be installing new features, add-ins, or language packs, requiring multiple resource files.\n     - **Suspicious activity**: Malware could be using SDXHelper.exe as a dropper to inject malicious code disguised as legitimate resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations**\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - **Office Updates\/Add-ins**: SDXHelper.exe is known to handle Office updates, and creating resource files could be part of this process.\n  - **Localization**: The `strings.min.js` files might be language-specific resources for Office applications.\n\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - **Process Spoofing**: If SDXHelper.exe is **not the genuine Microsoft process** (e.g., replaced by malware), the file creation could be part of a **payload delivery** or **data exfiltration** scheme.\n  - **Persistence**: Malware might use the Office directory to hide malicious files, leveraging the legitimacy of the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Verify Process Authenticity**:\n   - Check the **digital signature** of SDXHelper.exe:\n     - **Legitimate**: Signed by Microsoft.\n     - **Suspicious**: Unsigned, or signed by an unknown entity.\n   - Confirm the file path: Genuine Microsoft processes are typically located in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\...` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents**:\n   - Use tools like **Strings**, **Hex Editor**, or **VirusTotal** to inspect the contents of the created `.min.js` files.\n   - Look for obfuscation, suspicious URLs, or code that does not align with Office functionality.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Check for **unusual network activity**, **registry changes**, or **unauthorized access** to the Office directory.\n   - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to correlate this activity with other system events.\n\n4. **Update and Patch**:\n   - Ensure Office and the operating system are fully updated, as outdated software is a common attack vector.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior could be **legitimate** (e.g., Office updates), the **high volume of files** and the **minified JavaScript** format warrant **caution**. Further investigation into the **process authenticity**, **file contents**, and **system context** is necessary to rule out malicious activity. If SDXHelper.exe is confirmed as genuine and the files are part of a known Office update, the behavior is likely benign. Otherwise, it may indicate a **compromise**."}

Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Legitimacy**:  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known Microsoft Office process, often involved in **installation, updates, or resource management**. The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`) suggest they might be **localized resource files** or **temporary files** generated during an Office operation (e.g., updates, language packs).\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern**:  \n   - The files are created in the same directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\resources\\Offline\\...`  \n   - Filenames follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, which could indicate **hashed identifiers** for specific resources or updates.\n\n3. **Potential Scenarios**:  \n   - **Office Update\/Installation**: The process might be generating temporary files during an update or deployment of Office components.  \n   - **Localization\/Caching**: The `.min` files could be **minified JavaScript\/CSS** files for Office add-ins or web-based components, cached locally.  \n   - **Legitimate Behavior**: The repetition of file creation is likely part of a **normal Office operation**, though the exact purpose may not be explicitly documented.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Concerning?**\n- **No Immediate Red Flags**:  \n  - The process is associated with Microsoft Office (a trusted source).  \n  - The files are created in a standard Office directory.  \n  - No unusual behavior (e.g., high CPU, network activity) is mentioned in the logs.  \n\n- **Potential Concerns (if applicable)**:  \n  - If **unusual activity** (e.g., large file counts, unexpected network traffic) is observed alongside this, further investigation is warranted.  \n  - Ensure **SDXHelper.exe** is not a **malware impersonation** (check via antivirus, process integrity, and digital signatures).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Monitor for Anomalies**:  \n   - Check if the files are being created during **Office updates** or **user-initiated installations**.  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Windows Event Viewer** to trace the files' purpose.\n\n2. **Verify Process Authenticity**:  \n   - Confirm the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).  \n   - Use antivirus\/malware scanners to rule out impersonation.\n\n3. **Cleanup (if necessary)**:  \n   - If the files are **temporary** and no longer needed, they can be safely deleted (though caution is advised without confirming their purpose).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nThe logs appear to reflect **legitimate Office activity**, likely related to updates or resource management. However, if the behavior is unexpected or accompanied by other suspicious signs, further investigation is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if these events are malicious or not. Let me start by looking at the details provided. All the events are about files being created, and the process involved is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The user mentioned that they want to know if these events are malicious.\n\nFirst, I should check what \"SDXHelper.exe\" is. I know that sometimes legitimate software can have processes with similar names, but there's also a possibility of malware using such names. Let me think. SDXHelper... Maybe it's part of some software, but I'm not sure. I should verify if this is a known legitimate process or if it's commonly associated with malware.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be in the \"Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\" directory. That directory is typically associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or solutions. However, the files are named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" – \"min.js\" suggests they're minified JavaScript files. That's common in web development, but why would they be in an Office directory?\n\nWait, maybe these files are part of an Office add-in or some extension. But the fact that there are so many of them, and they're all being created by SDXHelper.exe, could be a red flag. Malware often creates multiple files in a short time. Also, the use of \"aicopilot\" in the filename – I don't recognize that as a standard Office feature. Maybe it's a typo or a fake name.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Let me think. A quick search in my mind... There's a legitimate process called \"SDXHelper.exe\" associated with some software, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be part of a malicious payload. Since the user hasn't provided more context, like the source of the files or the system's state, I have to rely on the given information.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. There are multiple entries with the same file names, each being created by SDXHelper.exe. That might indicate that the process is generating a lot of files, which is unusual for legitimate software. Also, the fact that all these files are JavaScript minified files in an Office directory is suspicious. Office usually doesn't use JavaScript files in that location unless it's part of an add-in, but even then, the naming seems off.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a false positive. Maybe the user is using some software that legitimately creates these files. However, without more information, it's hard to tell. The key here is the combination of the process name, the location of the files, and the nature of the files being created.\n\nIn summary, the suspicious elements are:\n1. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" which isn't widely known.\n2. The creation of multiple minified JavaScript files in a non-standard location (Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory).\n3. The repetition of similar filenames, which could indicate automated or malicious file generation.\n\nGiven these points, it's more likely that this activity is malicious. However, to be thorough, I should suggest checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe, verifying its location (if it's in a system directory like C:\\Windows\\System32 or a user-specific AppData folder), and running a malware scan. Also, checking if the user has recently installed any new software that might be responsible for this activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve multiple file creation activities by the **SDXHelper.exe** process, generating **minified JavaScript files** in the **Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages** directory. Here's a structured analysis of the potential maliciousness:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concerns and Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Unusual Process Name**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized or documented legitimate process in Microsoft Office or Windows. Legitimate processes in this context typically have names like `EXCEL.EXE`, `WINWORD.EXE`, or `OUTLOOK.EXE`.\n\n2. **File Location and Naming**:\n   - **Location**: The files are created in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory, which is typically used for **Office add-ins** or **custom solutions**. However, **JavaScript files** (`*.min.js`) are not standard in this context.\n   - **File Names**: The filenames (`officeaicopilot-strings.min.js`) are suspicious. The term \"aicopilot\" is not associated with any known Microsoft Office component. The use of `min.js` (minified JavaScript) is common in web development but unusual for Office-related files.\n\n3. **Repetition and Volume**:\n   - Multiple identical files are created repeatedly, which is atypical for legitimate software. Malware often generates redundant files to evade detection or execute malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No information is provided about **SDXHelper.exe**'s origin, digital signature, or association with known software. Legitimate processes are usually signed by Microsoft or trusted developers.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Malicious Behavior**\n- **Malware Payload Delivery**: The files could be part of a **malicious add-in** or **exploit kit** targeting Microsoft Office.\n- **Persistence Mechanism**: The process may be creating files to establish persistence or execute code in the context of Office applications.\n- **Command-and-Control (C2) Communication**: Minified JavaScript files might be used to communicate with a remote server, exfiltrating data or receiving further instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Mitigation**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **Check the file path**: If `SDXHelper.exe` is located in a non-standard directory (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp` or user-specific folders), it is likely malicious.\n   - **Digital Signature**: Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to verify if the process is signed by a trusted entity.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan using **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to detect potential threats.\n\n3. **Network Monitoring**:\n   - Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections (e.g., to unknown domains) that could indicate C2 activity.\n\n4. **Check for Recent Software Installation**:\n   - Determine if any new software was recently installed, as this could be the source of the malicious process.\n\n5. **Disable or Remove Suspicious Files**:\n   - If confirmed malicious, delete the files and remove the associated process. Reboot the system to ensure no residual threats remain.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of an **unusual process name**, **suspicious file locations and naming**, and **repetitive file creation** strongly suggests **malicious activity**. While further investigation is needed to confirm the intent (e.g., whether it is a false positive from legitimate software), the indicators point toward a potential **malware infection** or **exploit attempt**. Immediate action to scan and isolate the system is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the events, they all involve the creation of files. Most of them are under the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory, and the files are named with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a .js extension. There are multiple entries for the same file, which might indicate that the file was created multiple times, maybe by the same process.\n\nNow, looking at the processes involved. Most of the file creations are done by SDXHelper.exe, except for one entry where it's chrome.exe creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder. The SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft Office, I think. But why are there so many file creations here?\n\nThe files being created are JavaScript files, which are typically used for web applications. However, in the context of Office, maybe they're part of some add-ins or updates. But creating multiple copies of the same file might be unusual. Maybe it's a sign of something like a malware trying to inject code or replicate files. However, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known process. But I should check if there's any known issues with that process creating multiple files.\n\nThe chrome.exe entry is creating a temporary file, which is normal behavior for browsers, but the filename is a GUID, which is typical for temporary files. That one might not be suspicious.\n\nBut the repetition of the same files being created by SDXHelper.exe multiple times could be a red flag. Maybe it's a benign process doing some updates, but the sheer number of entries might indicate a problem. Alternatively, it could be a log file being generated multiple times, but the file names are different each time. Wait, looking at the file names, each has a different hash part after the min_, so they're different files. Wait, no, the first few entries have different hashes, but some are the same. For example, the first entry is min_9e5a..., then min_9e5a again, then min_9e5a again. Wait, no, looking back, the first entry is min_9e5a..., then another entry with the same hash. Wait, no, the user input shows entries with different hashes, but some are repeated. For example, the first one is min_9e5a..., then another with min_9e5a again, but the user's input shows different hashes. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user input has entries with different hashes. For example, the first one is min_9e5a..., then min_9e5a again, but looking at the actual data provided, the first few entries have different hashes. Wait, the user's input shows:\n\nFirst entry: min_9e5a3546-... (but the actual text in the input is \"min_9e5a3546-...\", then another entry with min_9e5a3546 again. Wait, no, looking at the actual input, the first line is:\n\n\"min_9e5a3546-...\", then another line with the same hash, then another with min_9e5a3546 again. Wait, but looking at the user's input, the first few entries have different hashes. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's input is:\n\n{\"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file\": \"min_9e5a3546...\"},\n{\"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file\": \"min_9e5a3546...\"},\n{\"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file\": \"min_9e5a3546...\"},\nWait, no, actually, looking at the actual text provided, the first few entries have different hashes. Wait, the user provided a list of entries, and each has a different hash part. For example:\n\nFirst entry: min_9e5a3546-...\nSecond: min_9e5a3546-...\nWait, no, looking at the user's input, the first line is:\n\n{\"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\", \"file\": \"min_9e5a3546...\"},\nThen another line with the same file name, then another, but then different ones. Wait, actually, the user input shows that some files are created multiple times, but each has a unique hash. Wait, no, looking at the actual data, the user's input has entries like:\n\n\"min_9e5a3546-...\", then \"min_9e5a3546-...\", but then others like \"min_9e5a3546-...\" again. Wait, perhaps the user's input has multiple entries for the same file name. Wait, no, looking at the actual text, each entry has a different hash. Wait, no, the user's input shows entries with different hashes. For example, the first entry is min_9e5a..., then another with min_9e5a..., but then others with different hashes. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's input is a list of entries where the same file is created multiple times. But the actual hash parts are different. So each entry is a different file. That would be normal. However, if the same file is created multiple times, that might be suspicious. But in the user's input, each entry has a unique hash, so they are different files. Therefore, the repetition is not about the same file, but different files. So that might not be suspicious.\n\nBut then why are there so many entries? If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's generating a lot of files. However, the fact that all these files are JavaScript files and under the Office directory might be part of some legitimate process, like downloading updates or add-ins. However, creating multiple JavaScript files might be unusual. Alternatively, it could be a sign of a malicious process. But since it's SDXHelper.exe, which is a legitimate process, it's more likely to be benign.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple entries might be a red flag. It's possible that the user is seeing this in a security tool, and the system is flagging it as suspicious. In that case, the user should check for any other signs of malware, like unexpected network activity, high CPU usage, or other unusual behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the SDXHelper.exe process is legitimate, the creation of numerous JavaScript files in the Office directory might be worth investigating further to ensure that it's not part of a malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe creation of multiple JavaScript files (`*.min_...js`) in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory by **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) could be **benign or suspicious**, depending on context. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Behavior**\n- **SDXHelper.exe** is part of Microsoft Office and is involved in **add-in management, updates, or configuration tasks**. \n- **JavaScript files** in the `SolutionPackages` directory may be related to **Office add-ins** (e.g., COM add-ins, VSTO solutions) or **update packages**.\n- **Repetition of file creation** might be due to:\n  - **Multiple add-in installations or updates**.\n  - **Logging or temporary file generation** during Office operations.\n  - **Redundant operations** (e.g., failed attempts to update or install a package).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Suspicious Indicators**\n- **Unusual volume of files**: If the number of files is **significantly high** (e.g., hundreds or thousands), it could indicate **malware** or **data exfiltration**.\n- **File naming patterns**: \n  - While the `.min_...js` format is common for minified JavaScript, **randomly generated hashes** (e.g., `min_9e5a3546-...`) might be used by malware to avoid detection.\n- **Lack of user interaction**: If these files are created **without user action** (e.g., during startup or idle time), it could be suspicious.\n- **Network activity**: If SDXHelper.exe is **communicating with unknown IPs or domains**, it may be compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Next Steps for Investigation**\n- **Check file contents**: Use a hex editor or tool like **Strings** to inspect the JavaScript files for **malicious code** (e.g., obfuscated scripts, URLs, or payloads).\n- **Monitor process behavior**:\n  - Use tools like **Process Monitor (ProcMon)** or **ProcDot** to trace file operations and network requests by SDXHelper.exe.\n  - Check for **unusual registry writes** or **DLL injections**.\n- **Scan for malware**: Run a full system scan with **Windows Defender**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Kaspersky** to rule out infections.\n- **Check Office add-ins**: Go to **File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Add-ins** in Office to review installed add-ins for anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Mitigation**\n- **Update Office**: Ensure all Office updates are applied, as outdated versions may have vulnerabilities.\n- **Disable untrusted add-ins**: Remove any add-ins not explicitly needed.\n- **Restrict permissions**: Ensure SDXHelper.exe has **minimal permissions** to the `AppData` directory (via **Windows Defender Application Control** or **Group Policy**).\n- **Enable logging**: Use **Windows Event Viewer** to monitor **Application and Security logs** for errors or warnings related to SDXHelper.exe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **SDXHelper.exe is legitimate**, the **high volume of JavaScript files** in the Office directory warrants further investigation. If no malicious activity is detected, it is likely **benign** (e.g., routine add-in operations). However, **vigilance is key**, and any unexplained behavior should be probed thoroughly."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple JavaScript files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js\". The task is to determine if these logs indicate a security threat or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what SDXHelper.exe is. Maybe it's a legitimate process? I should check. Let me think... SDXHelper might be related to some software, maybe a helper process for an application. But I'm not sure. If it's a known legitimate process, then creating these files might be normal. However, if it's not a known process, that could be a red flag.\n\nNext, looking at the files being created. They are all minified JavaScript files, which is common in web development. But the fact that they're being created in the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under Microsoft Office's folder is interesting. Maybe this is part of an update or some kind of extension. However, the repetition of the same file names with different hashes (the xxxxxx part) might indicate that multiple versions are being generated, which could be normal, or it could be part of a malicious activity like distributing malware.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the volume of these files. There are 16 entries here, each creating a different file. If this is a one-time event, it might not be a problem. But if this is happening repeatedly or in large quantities, that could be suspicious. Also, the fact that all the files are created by the same process might indicate that the process is generating these files, which could be part of a legitimate process or a malicious one.\n\nI should also think about the names of the files. \"officeaicopilot-strings\" – maybe that's a typo? Like \"Office AI Copilot\"? If that's the case, maybe it's related to a new feature in Office, like AI Copilot. If that's a legitimate feature, then the files could be part of an update. However, if the process isn't associated with Microsoft, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: checking if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. Let me think... I don't recall SDXHelper.exe being part of standard Microsoft Office. It might be part of a third-party application or a potentially unwanted program (PUP). If it's not a known process, that's a red flag. Also, the fact that the files are being created in the Office directory might be an attempt to mimic legitimate processes, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAdditionally, the use of minified JavaScript files could be part of a legitimate update, but it's also common in malware to use such files to obfuscate their code. However, without more context, like the content of the files or network activity, it's hard to tell. But based on the information given, the repetition and the process name might be suspicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process and is generating multiple minified JavaScript files in a sensitive directory, this could indicate a potential security threat. However, if SDXHelper is part of a legitimate application that's updating or installing components, then it's normal. Since the user hasn't provided more context, the safest assumption might be that this is suspicious, but further investigation would be needed to confirm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is generating multiple minified JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxx.js`) in the `OfflineFiles` directory under Microsoft Office's path. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Name (SDXHelper.exe):**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized legitimate process in standard Microsoft Office or Windows systems. It may be associated with third-party software, potentially malicious tools, or a misconfigured application.\n\n2. **File Generation Pattern:**\n   - The files are named with a common prefix (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_`) followed by unique hash-like suffixes (e.g., `xxxxxx`). This pattern is often seen in **malware** or **obfuscated scripts** to avoid detection or mimic legitimate updates.\n   - The repeated creation of such files (16 entries) raises concerns about **unauthorized activity**, especially if the process is not part of a known, legitimate application.\n\n3. **Location (`OfflineFiles`):**\n   - The `OfflineFiles` directory is typically used by Windows for caching network files. Generating files here could indicate **unauthorized caching** or **malicious persistence**.\n\n4. **Minified JavaScript:**\n   - While minified JS files are common in web development, their presence in a local system directory (outside of a browser or web server context) is unusual and may suggest **malware** attempting to execute or distribute payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Indicators:**\n- **Unusual Process Behavior:** SDXHelper.exe is not a standard Windows or Microsoft Office process. This could indicate a **Trojan**, **spyware**, or **adware**.\n- **File Generation in Sensitive Directories:** Writing files to `OfflineFiles` (a system-managed directory) is highly suspicious and may be an attempt to **hide malicious activity**.\n- **Repetition and Hashing:** The use of unique hashes in filenames could be an attempt to **avoid detection** by signature-based scanners.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **Process Explorer** to check if SDXHelper.exe is associated with known malware or legitimate software.\n   - Check the **file path** of SDXHelper.exe (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...` vs. `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\...`). Malware often resides in user directories.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware removal tools.\n   - Check for **unexpected network activity** (e.g., outgoing connections to unknown IPs) using tools like **Wireshark** or **Netstat**.\n\n3. **Monitor File Activity:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor (ProcMon)** to track file\/directory access by SDXHelper.exe. Look for **deletion, encryption, or exfiltration** of sensitive data.\n\n4. **Check for Office AI Copilot (if applicable):**\n   - If the system is running a newer version of Microsoft Office with **AI Copilot**, ensure that updates are applied through official channels. However, the files described are not standard for such features.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe behavior described is **highly suspicious** and likely indicates a **malicious process** (e.g., **Trojan** or **spyware**). Immediate action is recommended to investigate and neutralize the threat. If SDXHelper.exe is confirmed to be legitimate, the files may be part of a **legitimate update**, but this is unlikely given the context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The paths look a bit long and specific. Now, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a legitimate process. However, since I don't have that context, I'll have to rely on the logs.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash and .js. The repetition of similar filenames suggests that maybe these files are being created multiple times, perhaps as part of an update or some automated process. But why so many? If this is normal behavior, maybe it's not suspicious. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are events related to chrome.exe. One is a registry value set, and another is an image loaded (urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll). The image loaded events are common for Windows processes, like urlmon.dll being part of Internet Explorer, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender. So those might be normal.\n\nBut back to SDXHelper.exe. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory might be unusual. If this is part of a legitimate application, maybe it's normal. However, without knowing what SDXHelper.exe is, it's hard to tell. Another thing to consider is the directory path: AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That seems like a place where Office might store temporary files or packages, but creating so many JavaScript files there could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the filenames have a pattern that includes a hash. That's common in some malicious activities, like obfuscating filenames. However, it's also common in legitimate software for versioning. But the repetition of the same filenames being created multiple times might indicate something else.\n\nAnother point is that there's no mention of any user interaction or known good processes. If this is part of an installer or update, there might be other logs, but here it's just these file creations. Also, the lack of any other processes or events related to SDXHelper.exe beyond file creation might be a concern. Usually, a legitimate process would have more varied activities.\n\nI should also check if there are any other events that might indicate compromise. The chrome.exe events seem normal. The registry value set by chrome.exe might be part of normal operations. But the SDXHelper.exe activity is the main concern here.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, the nature of the files (JavaScript with hash names), and the lack of context about SDXHelper.exe. These could indicate either a legitimate process or a potential security threat. Since the user is asking for an investigation, this would be worth flagging as interesting for further analysis, such as checking the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, examining the contents of the created files, and looking for other related events.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains activity that warrants further investigation due to the following observations:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **14+ events** show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_*.js`) in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`.\n   - **Pattern:** Filenames use a hash-like suffix (e.g., `min_e8258ccc81800836b588886c13cb1182.js`), which is common in obfuscation or versioning but can also be seen in malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a widely recognized legitimate process in Microsoft ecosystems. While it could be part of a third-party application, its lack of visibility in standard system processes raises suspicion.\n   - The repetitive creation of files in a Microsoft Office-related directory (`SolutionPackages`) suggests either:\n     - **Legitimate activity** (e.g., a custom Office add-in or update), or  \n     - **Suspicious behavior** (e.g., data exfiltration, payload storage, or mimicry of legitimate processes).\n\n3. **No Clear Context for `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - No additional events (e.g., process execution, network activity, or user interaction) are logged for `SDXHelper.exe`, making it difficult to determine intent.\n\n4. **Chrome-Related Events:**\n   - `chrome.exe` logs are **benign** (e.g., loading `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`), which are standard Windows components. No anomalies here.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting:**\n- The **repetitive file creation** by `SDXHelper.exe` in a Microsoft Office directory, combined with the **unusual filename pattern**, could indicate:\n  - **Malicious activity** (e.g., staging files for execution, data exfiltration, or persistence).\n  - **Misconfigured software** (e.g., a third-party tool improperly interacting with Office).\n- The **absence of context** for `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., no prior process execution logs) suggests a lack of visibility into its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Check if the process is signed, its origin (e.g., file system path), and its behavior via tools like **Process Explorer** or **ProcMon**.\n   - Search for the executable in the system (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...`).\n\n2. **Analyze the Created Files:**\n   - Examine the contents of the `.js` files for obfuscation, embedded payloads, or references to external resources.\n\n3. **Check for Network Activity:**\n   - Monitor if `SDXHelper.exe` communicates with external IPs or domains (e.g., via **Wireshark** or **Windows Firewall logs**).\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Look for related events in **Windows Event Logs** (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon\/Operational` for process creation, network connections).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity involving `SDXHelper.exe` is **suspicious** and merits further analysis to determine if it represents a legitimate process or a potential security threat. The repetitive file creation in a Microsoft Office directory, combined with the lack of context, is a red flag."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe. The chrome.exe events include things like image loaded, registry value set, and file stream created. The SDXHelper.exe events are mostly about file creation in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages.\n\nLooking at the file paths for SDXHelper.exe, they all point to the same user's AppData folder, specifically under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files created there seem to be JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. That seems a bit odd because those are typically resource files, but the repetition of the same file names being created multiple times might indicate something. However, since they're in the Office SolutionPackages directory, maybe they're part of a legitimate Office add-in or something similar. But why are they being created so many times?\n\nThen there's the chrome.exe activity. The image loaded event points to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably normal. But then there are multiple registry value set events. Changing registry values can be suspicious, especially if it's done by chrome.exe. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for various purposes, so it's not necessarily malicious. But the repetition here might be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the file streams created for the Excel file \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier. Zone.Identifier is a file that Windows uses to mark files downloaded from the internet as coming from a different zone (like the Internet zone) which can trigger security warnings. Creating a Zone.Identifier stream is normal when downloading files, but the fact that chrome.exe is creating these streams multiple times might be worth looking into. Maybe the file is being manipulated or there's some ongoing activity related to it.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. If this is part of a legitimate Office add-in, then maybe it's normal. However, the repetition and the specific naming with hashes might suggest that these files are generated dynamically, which could be part of a malicious payload. But without more context, like the content of the files or network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe registry changes by chrome.exe could be benign, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding new entries, that's a concern. However, the events here just mention registry value set, not the specific keys or values. So there's not enough info there.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory and the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. However, without more data, it's hard to confirm if this is malicious or just unusual behavior. The presence of both chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe activities might indicate a combination of normal and possibly suspicious activities. I'd need to check for other indicators like network traffic, process tree, or file content analysis to determine if this is a threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain a mix of **normal system behavior** and **potentially suspicious activity**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Normal Activity**\n- **`chrome.exe` and `MpClient.dll`**  \n  - The `chrome.exe` process loading `MpClient.dll` (part of Windows Defender) is **legitimate**. Chrome and other applications may interact with antivirus components for real-time protection.\n\n- **Zone.Identifier Streams**  \n  - Creation of `Zone.Identifier` streams for the Excel file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) is **normal**. These are used by Windows to track the origin of downloaded files (e.g., Internet zone) and trigger security warnings if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n#### **A. Repeated File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**\n- **File Paths**:  \n  - All files are created in:  \n    ```  \n    C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...  \n    ```  \n  - These files are JavaScript files named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`.  \n\n- **Why This Is Suspicious**:  \n  - **Repetition**: The same file names are created **multiple times** (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_f4daea64e41ab931528e60ef3b523fe7.js`). This could indicate **dynamic generation** of files, which is common in **malware** (e.g., obfuscation, payload delivery).  \n  - **Location**: The `SolutionPackages` directory is typically used by **Microsoft Office add-ins**. While legitimate, **abnormal file creation** here could signal a **compromised add-in** or **malicious software** impersonating a legitimate Office component.  \n\n#### **B. Registry Modifications by `chrome.exe`**\n- **Event**: Multiple `Registry value set` entries for `chrome.exe`.  \n- **Why This Is Suspicious**:  \n  - While Chrome may legitimately modify the registry (e.g., for extensions or settings), **repeated or unusual changes** could indicate **tampering** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, redirection of traffic, or injection of malicious code).  \n  - No specific registry keys or values are mentioned, so further investigation (e.g., checking the registry history) is needed.\n\n#### **C. File Stream Creation for Excel File**\n- **Event**: Multiple `File stream created` entries for `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` and its `Zone.Identifier`.  \n- **Why This Is Suspicious**:  \n  - **Repeated creation** of the same file stream may suggest **ongoing manipulation** of the file (e.g., embedding malicious content, logging, or exfiltration).  \n  - The file could be a **vector for malware** (e.g., embedded macros or malicious scripts).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **File Paths**:  \n  - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n- **Process Names**:  \n  - `SDXHelper.exe` (uncommon name; may be a **dropper** or **malware component**).  \n  - `chrome.exe` (legitimate, but **abnormal behavior**).  \n- **File Names**:  \n  - `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (suspicious naming pattern).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Check File Content**:  \n  - Analyze the JavaScript files created by `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., using a sandbox or static analysis tool) to determine if they contain malicious code.  \n- **Investigate Registry Changes**:  \n  - Review the specific registry keys modified by `chrome.exe` to identify any unusual entries.  \n- **Monitor Network Traffic**:  \n  - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` or `chrome.exe` is communicating with **external IPs** or **malicious domains**.  \n- **Verify `SDXHelper.exe`**:  \n  - Confirm if `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of a software suite or if it’s **unsigned\/unknown**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity is normal (e.g., Chrome interacting with Windows Defender), the **repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** and **unusual registry modifications** by `chrome.exe` warrant further investigation. These could indicate **malware activity** or **compromise**, particularly if the files in `SolutionPackages` are linked to **unauthorized behavior**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash-like strings. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might indicate that they're being created multiple times, but maybe that's normal?\n\nThen there are a few other processes: chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and combase.dll, which are standard system DLLs. Also, EXCEL.EXE opening a spreadsheet. And winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe is a Microsoft Office process, right? It's part of the Office suite, used for various helper tasks. The files being created in the SolutionPackages directory are probably part of Office's normal operations, like storing resources or temporary files. But why are there so many entries for the same files? Maybe they're being updated or replaced? However, the fact that they're all in the same directory and have similar names might be normal.\n\nThe other events don't seem suspicious. Chrome loading standard DLLs is normal. EXCEL.EXE opening a file is a regular activity. The winlogbeat.exe event is about a configuration file being created, which could be part of installing or configuring the tool. \n\nBut wait, are there any signs of malicious activity? The files created by SDXHelper.exe don't have obvious malicious names. The hashes in the filenames could be version identifiers or unique identifiers for different resources. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be worth checking. But considering that Office might generate these files during installation or updates, it's probably legitimate.\n\nThe only thing that stands out is the winlogbeat event. Winlogbeat is a tool for collecting logs, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its setup. But unless there's an unusual path or unexpected behavior, it's likely normal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events seem to be part of normal user activities and legitimate processes. There's no indication of malware or suspicious behavior. Therefore, the classification should be \"No\" for interesting, with a justification that the events are typical for the processes involved and no anomalies detected. The confidence would be high, maybe 0.95, since all the activities align with normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"No\",\n  \"justification\": \"The events represent normal system and application behavior. SDXHelper.exe creating files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory is part of legitimate Office operations.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks like part of Microsoft Office's temporary files, so maybe that's normal. But creating files there could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, I need to check more events.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. But the repetition might not be a problem unless there's an unusual pattern.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set by svchost.exe multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes can be normal, but if there are too many or specific keys modified, that could be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify the registry keys, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE creates a temporary file (~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx) in the Downloads folder and then deletes it. Temporary files are common, but the creation and deletion might be part of normal operations. However, if this is a pattern, maybe not.\n\nAnother event is a Pipe Created by EXCEL.EXE. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but again, depends on context.\n\nThere are also two entries with process null, which might be incomplete logs or events not tied to a specific process. Not sure if that's significant here.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe again, it's creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages. If these files are being created frequently or have unusual content, that could be a problem. But just creating them might not be enough.\n\nI need to check for any anomalies. The same JavaScript file is created twice by SDXHelper.exe. Maybe that's a mistake in the log, or maybe it's a legitimate action. However, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper in the Office directory might be worth investigating, especially if those files are not part of a known legitimate process.\n\nAlso, the repeated ImageLoad events for the same DLLs might be normal if Excel is doing something that requires those libraries. But if there's an unusual number of loads or unexpected DLLs, that's a concern.\n\nThe Registry events by svchost.exe are a bit concerning because svchost can be used by malware to modify the registry. But without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to say. However, multiple Registry value sets could indicate some activity that's worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some suspicious elements like the SDXHelper creating files in Office directories, multiple registry changes by svchost, and the temporary file creation\/deletion. However, many of these could be part of normal operations. The confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but there are enough indicators that might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directories, combined with repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and Excel loading system DLLs, suggest potential anomalous behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. Not sure about that yet. Then there are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and UI strings, like am-et-ui-strings-json. That seems odd because those files look like they might be part of some localization package, but why so many being created?\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE creating a temp file and loading some DLLs. The Zone.Identifier stream is normal for marking files as coming from the internet, but the repeated creation of those files might be a red flag. Also, the process names like SDXHelper.exe aren't ones I recognize as standard Office processes. Microsoft Office typically uses processes like EXCEL.EXE, WINWORD.EXE, etc. SDXHelper.exe might be a third-party tool or something malicious.\n\nThe fact that so many files are being created in the SolutionPackages folder, which is part of Office's structure, could indicate that something is trying to inject code or modify the Office environment. The ImageLoad events for coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL are normal, but if those files were not signed or came from an unexpected location, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't show the file paths for those DLLs beyond the standard locations.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same files being created multiple times. That might be a sign of a loop or a script that's running repeatedly. Also, HxTsr.exe's registry modification could be part of a configuration change, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's benign or malicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the suspicious parts are the unusual process names, the large number of files being created in a specific directory with non-standard names, and the repetition of those events. While some activities are normal (like Excel creating temp files), the combination of these events might indicate a potential security threat. However, without more information, such as the source of the files or the user's actions, it's a bit tricky. But based on the logs provided, there's enough to consider this suspicious and warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Activity**\n- **`HxTsr.exe`** modifying the registry:  \n  This process is not a standard Microsoft Office component. Registry changes could indicate configuration tampering or malware attempting to persist.\n\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`** creating numerous files in the Office `SolutionPackages` directory:  \n  - **File Naming Pattern**: Files like `am-et-ui-strings-json_*.js` suggest localization resources, but the sheer volume (multiple entries for each file) and lack of user context (e.g., no indication of an Office add-in or update) are concerning.  \n  - **Location**: The `SolutionPackages` directory is typically used by Office for managing add-ins and templates. Unusual file creation here might indicate tampering or injection of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Excel Process Behavior**\n- **Temporary File Creation**:  \n  `EXCEL.EXE` creating a file named `1680A406.xlsx` with a `Zone.Identifier` stream is normal for marking files as \"downloaded from the internet.\" However, the **repetition of this event** (multiple logs for the same file) suggests unusual behavior, possibly due to a loop or malicious activity.\n\n- **DLL Loading**:  \n  - **`coml2.dll`** and **`VBEUI.DLL`** are legitimate system components, but the logs do not include **file hash** or **signature verification** details. If these DLLs were not signed or sourced from unexpected locations, it could indicate a compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Red Flags**\n- **Repetition of Events**:  \n  The same files (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_*.js`) are created multiple times by `SDXHelper.exe`, which is not a standard process. This could indicate a **script or malware** generating files in a loop.\n\n- **Lack of User Context**:  \n  No logs indicate user-initiated actions (e.g., installing software, opening files). This absence of context raises concerns about **unauthorized activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Threats**\n- **Malware Infection**:  \n  The combination of unusual processes, file creation, and repeated events could indicate a **malware payload** attempting to persist or exfiltrate data.\n\n- **Office Exploitation**:  \n  The use of `SolutionPackages` and `EXCEL.EXE` might suggest an attack leveraging **Office vulnerabilities** (e.g., via malicious documents).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check File Integrity**:  \n   Verify the hashes of files created by `SDXHelper.exe` and compare them to known-good sources.\n\n2. **Investigate `HxTsr.exe` and `SDXHelper.exe`**:  \n   - Check if these processes are signed by trusted entities.  \n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **ProcMon** to trace their behavior.\n\n3. **Review User Activity**:  \n   Determine if the user interacted with suspicious files or visited malicious websites.\n\n4. **Scan for Malware**:  \n   Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.\n\n5. **Monitor Network Traffic**:  \n   Look for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nWhile some events (e.g., Excel creating temp files) are normal, the **unusual processes, repeated file creation, and lack of context** strongly suggest **potential malicious activity**. Immediate investigation is recommended to mitigate risks."}

SDXHelper is part of Office, so maybe it's downloading language packs or resources. But why so many repeated entries for the same files? That might be a red flag. However, the paths look like legitimate Office resource files. Then there's Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE making registry changes and creating a shortcut in the Recent folder. Creating a shortcut is normal, but multiple registry changes from EXCEL.EXE could be suspicious. However, Excel often interacts with the registry for settings. The confidence here is low because there's no clear malicious activity. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper might be normal if they're part of Office updates.

Alright, first thing I notice is that there are a lot of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are 27 of those, all the same. Then there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\", and then two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe and a file was created in a specific path.\n\nHmm. So, the first thought is, why is Excel modifying the registry so many times? That's a lot. But Excel is a common application, and it's possible that it's doing legitimate things like updating settings or add-ins. However, the repetition might be a red flag. But then again, maybe it's just a user making a lot of changes. However, the fact that all these events are the same might indicate something automated or a script.\n\nThen, looking at the SDXHelper.exe entries. SDXHelper is part of Microsoft's Office solutions, I think. The file created is in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The file path seems to be part of an Office package, maybe a solution or add-in. Creating a JavaScript file there might be normal if it's part of an Office add-in. But I should check if that's typical. However, the presence of a .js file in that location could be suspicious if it's not expected. But again, depending on the context.\n\nNow, the combination of Excel modifying the registry repeatedly and then SDXHelper creating a file. Are these related? Maybe someone is trying to install a malicious add-in. But without more information, like the content of the JavaScript file or other events, it's hard to say. The fact that the file is named with a hash (f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2) might be a unique identifier for a specific package. But is that normal? I'm not sure.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The repeated registry changes by Excel could be benign, but the number is high. However, the presence of SDXHelper creating a file might be part of a legitimate Office solution. But if there are no other suspicious events, maybe it's not a threat. Alternatively, if this is part of a larger attack, like a malicious add-in being installed, but without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nSo, the justification would be that the combination of multiple registry modifications by Excel and a file creation by SDXHelper could indicate an attempt to install a malicious add-in.

The file paths have hashes in them, which might be normal for Office packages, but I should check if there's anything suspicious. Also, there are multiple entries for the same files being created twice, which could indicate redundancy or maybe an error. \n\nThen there are a few DNS queries for \"login.microsoftonline.com\" and \"www.google.com\", which are common domains.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event by SDXHelper.exe in various Office SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that all the events are the same process creating JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory under PackageResources.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe... I'm not too familiar with that process. Let me think. Microsoft Office has various helper processes, but SDXHelper doesn't ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's a third-party application or a component related to Office add-ins? Or perhaps it's part of some software development kit?\n\nLooking at the file paths: they're all in the SolutionPackages folder, which is typically used by Office for storing add-ins or solutions. The files are named with language codes (like en-us, es-es, etc.) and end with -ui-strings-json. That suggests they might be localization files or UI string resources for different languages. But why are they being created repeatedly?\n\nWait, the same file is being created multiple times. For example, en-us-ui-strings-json appears twice. That might be a red flag. If a process is creating the same file multiple times, it could be a sign of something unusual. Maybe a loop or a malicious activity?\n\nBut then again, maybe this is just part of a normal installation or update process. Office add-ins sometimes need to generate or copy files during installation. However, the repetition of the same files might be suspicious. Also, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I should check if that's a legitimate process. If it's not, that could be a sign of malware.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that all these files are JavaScript. Office usually uses XML or other formats for UI strings. But maybe this is a custom add-in that uses JavaScript. However, the repetition and the same process creating all of them still makes me cautious.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that this is a legitimate activity. Maybe the user is developing an Office add-in, and SDXHelper.exe is part of their development environment, generating these files as part of the build process. But in that case, why are the same files being created multiple times? That might be a mistake in the build process.\n\nAlternatively, if this is part of a normal operation, the user might not see any issues. But given the repetitive nature and the non-standard process name, it's worth flagging for further investigation. Maybe checking the process's digital signature, its location, and whether it's known to be malicious.\n\nIn summary, while the files might be legitimate, the repetition and the process name raise some concerns. The answer should highlight that these events are likely related to Office add-ins but note the potential for malicious activity due to the unusual process name and repetitive file creation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Events:**\n\nThe provided log entries document multiple file creation events by `SDXHelper.exe`, a process not typically associated with standard Microsoft Office operations. Each event involves the creation of JavaScript (`*.js`) files containing localized UI strings (e.g., `en-us-ui-strings-json`, `es-es-ui-strings-json`) within the `OfflineFiles` directory of Office `SolutionPackages`. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Repetition of File Creation:**\n   - The same files (e.g., `en-us-ui-strings-json_328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js`) are created multiple times, which is unusual for typical software operations. This could indicate a loop, redundant processing, or potential malicious activity.\n\n2. **Unusual Process Name:**\n   - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Microsoft Office process. While Microsoft Office may use helper processes, this name does not match known legitimate components. This raises suspicion about the process's origin and legitimacy.\n\n3. **File Context and Location:**\n   - The files are stored in `SolutionPackages`, a directory often used for Office add-ins or solutions. The `*.js` files with language-specific names may relate to localization or UI string resources for add-ins. However, the repetitive creation of these files is atypical.\n\n4. **Potential Legitimacy vs. Malicious Activity:**\n   - **Legitimate Scenario:** If the user is developing or deploying a custom Office add-in, `SDXHelper.exe` might be part of a development tool or build process generating these files. However, the repetition of identical files would still warrant investigation.\n   - **Malicious Scenario:** The process name and repetitive file creation could indicate malware, such as a dropper or loader generating resources for a malicious payload. Further analysis (e.g., process signature, origin, behavior) is required to confirm.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Verify Process Legitimacy:** Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by a trusted developer and located in a standard system directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\`).\n- **Monitor Behavior:** Use tools like Process Explorer or PowerShell to monitor the process's network activity, registry access, and file operations.\n- **Check for Malware:** Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software to rule out malware.\n- **Investigate Add-ins:** If the user is deploying Office add-ins, review the development environment and build scripts for anomalies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the events could be related to legitimate Office add-in operations, the repetitive file creation and non-standard process name strongly suggest further investigation is warranted to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and have .js extensions, which are typically JavaScript files. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is normal behavior. Office applications sometimes use such files for localization or other resources. However, the repetition of the same file paths multiple times might be a red flag. For example, some entries are duplicated, like the 'word_4ce4a05b791a68198d52edc311e474b9.js' file being logged twice. This could indicate either a logging issue or multiple creation events.\n\nNext, the process name SDXHelper.exe. I should check if this is a legitimate Microsoft process. A quick recall tells me that SDXHelper is part of the Office suite, specifically related to the setup and installation processes. So, if these files are part of an Office installation or update, it's normal. However, if this is happening outside of an expected update or installation window, it might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they are all within the User's AppData directory under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. This is a common location for temporary files during installations. However, the presence of multiple different language-specific files (like es-es, fr-ca, etc.) might be part of a localized installation. But again, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nAnother point is the lack of other processes or events. All events are from SDXHelper.exe, and there's no mention of other processes or system changes. This could be normal, but it's also possible that this is part of a larger activity that isn't captured here.\n\nConsidering potential threats, malware sometimes uses legitimate-sounding process names to create files in expected directories. However, without additional indicators like unexpected network activity, changes to system settings, or other anomalous processes, it's hard to confirm malicious intent here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity could be part of a legitimate Office installation or update, the repetition of file creation events and the specific location might warrant further investigation. Checking the system's update history and ensuring that SDXHelper.exe is indeed a legitimate file would be the next steps. If everything checks out, this might just be normal operation. If not, it could be a security concern.\n<\/think>\n\nThe observed activity involves the **SDXHelper.exe** process creating multiple JavaScript (.js) files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory under the user's AppData folder. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Context**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft process associated with **Office installation\/repair** (part of the \"Setup and Deployment\" component).\n   - The files created are named with **language codes** (e.g., `es-es`, `fr-ca`) and are `.js` files, which are commonly used for **localization resources** or **scripting** in Office applications.\n\n2. **File Path and Repetition**:\n   - Files are created in the **`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`** directory, a known location for temporary files during Office installations.\n   - **Duplicate entries** for the same file (e.g., `word_4ce4a05b791a68198d52edc311e474b9.js`) may indicate **repeated creation events** during installation or logging artifacts.\n\n3. **Lack of Anomalies**:\n   - No **unusual process behavior** (e.g., network activity, registry changes) is reported in the logs.\n   - No **non-Microsoft processes** or **suspicious file types** (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`) are involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Legitimate?**\n- **Yes**, if:\n  - The user recently **installed or updated Microsoft Office**.\n  - The files correspond to **localized resources** for a specific Office version or language pack.\n  - The activity aligns with **known Office installation behavior** (e.g., temporary files for setup).\n\n- **Suspicious**, if:\n  - The user **did not initiate an Office installation\/update**.\n  - The files are **unrelated to known Office versions** or contain **unexpected content** (e.g., obfuscated code, malicious payloads).\n  - The **SDXHelper.exe** process is **not digitally signed** or **located in an unexpected directory** (e.g., not in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office`).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the **file signature** (right-click > Properties > Digital Signatures) to confirm it is signed by Microsoft.\n   - Ensure the **file path** matches the expected location for Microsoft Office components.\n\n2. **Correlate with System Activity**:\n   - Check the **Windows Event Log** for **Office installation\/update events** (e.g., under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Setup**).\n   - Confirm if the user recently **downloaded or installed Office** (e.g., via Microsoft 365, Click-to-Run, or MSI installer).\n\n3. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Use **antivirus\/malware scanners** to scan the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office` directory for **unexpected threats**.\n   - Monitor for **unusual network traffic** or **system changes** (e.g., new scheduled tasks, registry modifications).\n\n4. **Monitor for Persistence**:\n   - If the activity persists **outside of installation windows**, investigate further for **potential persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry keys, startup items).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** if tied to a recent Office installation\/update. However, **further investigation** is warranted if the user did not initiate such activity or if **anomalies** (e.g., unsigned binaries, unexpected file content) are detected."}

The process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Microsoft Office, creating various UI string files in different languages. The paths are all within the Office SolutionPackages directory. Then there's one event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Office, so creating language-specific UI files might be normal, especially if there's an update or installation happening. However, the repetition of multiple files in different languages might be a bit unusual. But maybe it's just part of a package that includes all languages.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe event. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads folder could be part of a configuration setup. However, sometimes malware uses similar names to disguise itself. But since the user hasn't mentioned any other suspicious activity, like unexpected network traffic or other processes, it's hard to tell. \n\nWait, but looking at the paths again, all the SDXHelper events are in the Office directory, which is expected. The winlogbeat file is in the Downloads folder, which is a common place for users to put temporary files. However, the .new extension might indicate that it's a temporary file being written, which is normal during configuration. \n\nBut why are there so many files being created by SDXHelper? Maybe it's part of a large update or installation that's adding multiple language packs. If this is a one-time event, it might be normal. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like continuous creation of files, that could be concerning. \n\nAnother angle: the user might be using a tool like Winlogbeat for monitoring, so the .yml.new file could be a configuration file being set up. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nI should check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files. From what I recall, SDXHelper is involved in Office updates and might handle various components, including language packs. So creating those files could be part of that process. \n\nThe key here is whether these events are part of normal operations or not. Since the user hasn't provided additional logs or context, it's possible that these are legitimate. However, the presence of multiple files and the .new file might warrant further investigation. \n\nBut considering the information given, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The processes are legitimate, and the actions align with typical software behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating various JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the file names end with .js, which is typical for JavaScript files. But the directories they're being written to are under \"OfflineFiles\" and \"dist\" folders within the Office Packages.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software development kit or a tool related to Microsoft Office? But wait, the fact that these files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory makes me think that this might be related to some kind of add-in or extension for Office. However, the files are JavaScript files, which are more commonly used in web development, not native Office applications. \n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition. Each entry is almost identical, with the same process name and the same directory structure, just different file names. That could indicate that the process is generating a lot of these files, maybe as part of a build process or some kind of deployment. But why would that be flagged as suspicious? Well, if this is part of a legitimate software's normal operation, then it's okay. But if the system isn't expecting this process to be creating so many files in that location, it might be a red flag.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't mentioned any security context here. They just provided the logs. So maybe they're just asking if this is normal. However, the assistant's previous response flagged it as potential malicious activity. But is that accurate? Let me think again.\n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. A quick check in my mind – common Office processes are like WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE, etc. SDXHelper doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's part of a third-party application. But the fact that it's writing JavaScript files into the Office directories could be part of a malicious payload, trying to inject code or modify the Office environment. However, without more context, like the presence of other suspicious activities, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is developing an Office add-in using some SDK that uses SDXHelper.exe as part of the build process. In that case, creating these JavaScript files would be normal. But the user hasn't provided any such context. \n\nAnother angle: the file names include things like \"icon_built_in_svg_icon\" and \"ui-strings-json\". These could be part of a legitimate application's resources, but again, the location is unusual. Also, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files might be part of a larger operation, but again, without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn summary, while the activity itself isn't inherently malicious, the lack of a known legitimate process named SDXHelper.exe and the unusual file creation in the Office directories could indicate either a legitimate process with an uncommon name or a potential security threat. The assistant's previous response was cautious, pointing out the potential for malicious activity, but it's important to note that without further evidence, this is speculative.\n<\/think>\n\nThe activity described involves **SDXHelper.exe** creating multiple JavaScript (.js) files in the **Microsoft Office SolutionPackages** directory. Here's an analysis of the potential implications:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Name (SDXHelper.exe):**\n   - Not a standard Microsoft Office process. This could indicate a third-party tool, a legitimate SDK, or a potential malicious actor (e.g., malware or rogue software).\n\n2. **File Creation Patterns:**\n   - Files are named with prefixes like `icon_`, `ui-strings-json`, or `fabric.js`, suggesting they might be **resource files**, **icons**, or **UI components**.\n   - The repetition of entries (e.g., multiple identical logs for the same file) could imply a **build\/deployment process** or **malicious payload distribution**.\n\n3. **Directory Location:**\n   - Files are written to `Microsoft Office SolutionPackages`, which is typically used for **Office add-ins** or **extensions**. However, JavaScript files in this context are unusual, as Office applications traditionally use XML\/COM-based add-ins, not web technologies.\n\n### Potential Explanations:\n- **Legitimate Activity:**\n  - A **custom Office add-in** or **toolchain** (e.g., a development SDK) might use `SDXHelper.exe` to generate resources dynamically.\n  - The files could be part of a **local development environment** (e.g., testing an add-in).\n\n- **Suspicious Activity:**\n  - **Malware** could be using this process to inject malicious JavaScript into Office directories, potentially compromising the system or stealing data.\n  - The lack of a known legitimate association with `SDXHelper.exe` raises concerns, especially if this process is not expected on the system.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Legitimacy:**\n   - Check if `SDXHelper.exe` is part of a known, trusted application (e.g., via file signature, digital certificate, or developer documentation).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process.\n\n2. **Monitor Behavior:**\n   - Track if the process accesses sensitive data, communicates with external servers, or modifies system files.\n\n3. **Security Measures:**\n   - If the activity is unexpected, **isolate the system**, run a **full antivirus scan**, and consider **removing the process** until its intent is clarified.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the activity is not definitively malicious, the combination of an **unusual process name**, **uncommon file creation in a critical directory**, and **repetitive behavior** warrants caution. Further investigation is needed to determine whether this is a legitimate process or a potential security threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch as a whole.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like it-it-ui-strings-json with some hash-like suffixes. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling add-ins or solutions. But creating a bunch of files with language codes and hashes... Hmm. The fact that these files are being created repeatedly might be normal if it's part of an installation or update, but maybe not.\n\nWait, but then there's also entries about EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe making various registry events. That's a bit more concerning. svchost.exe is a generic host process for Windows services, and if it's making a lot of registry changes, that could indicate something malicious, like a virus or malware trying to modify system settings. But then again, svchost.exe is normal for Windows, so maybe it's just regular system activity.\n\nHowever, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in the Office directory might be part of a legitimate process, but the combination with the registry changes and DNS queries could be a red flag. Also, the last entry has a process of null, which might be an error or an incomplete log entry. Not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the filenames have language codes (like it-it, km-kh) and unique hashes. That might be part of localization files, but why so many? Maybe a malicious actor is injecting their own files. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the presence of both file creation and registry changes could be part of a larger attack.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. Since there's a mix of normal processes (like EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe) doing things that could be normal or abnormal, but also the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe, which might be part of a legitimate process but could also be suspicious. The key here is that there's no obvious malicious activity in the logs, but the combination of multiple events might warrant further investigation. However, the answer might be that it's not necessarily malicious but could be part of a legitimate process, so maybe not interesting enough for investigation unless there's more context.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Pattern:** Repeated creation of `.js` files in the `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. Filenames include language codes (e.g., `it-it`, `km-kh`) and unique hash-like suffixes.\n   - **Context:** `SDXHelper.exe` is a legitimate component of Microsoft Office, often involved in managing add-ins or solutions. File creation in this directory could be part of a **legitimate Office installation\/update** or **add-in deployment**.\n   - **Suspicion:** While repetitive file creation might seem unusual, it is not inherently malicious. However, the presence of language-specific files with arbitrary hashes could warrant further scrutiny (e.g., checking for unexpected file content or unauthorized modifications).\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE:** A DNS query and registry modification event. These actions are common for legitimate Excel operations (e.g., network communication or configuration changes).\n   - **svchost.exe:** Multiple registry events (object additions, value changes). While `svchost.exe` is a standard Windows process, excessive or unexplained registry modifications could indicate **malware** (e.g., persistence mechanisms or configuration tampering).\n   - **Suspicion:** The registry activity is **neutral** without additional context. However, combined with the file creation events, it may suggest **coordinated activity** (e.g., a legitimate update or a potential compromise).\n\n3. **Null Process Entry:**\n   - A log entry with `process: null` and `task: None` is likely an **incomplete or malformed log**. It does not contribute to the analysis but may indicate a logging issue.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Legitimacy:** The majority of events (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe` file creation, `EXCEL.EXE` DNS query) are consistent with **normal Office operations**.\n- **Suspicion:** The **repetitive file creation** and **registry changes** could be benign (e.g., updates) or **indicative of compromise** (e.g., malware injection). The lack of clear malicious indicators (e.g., suspicious file content, network exfiltration) makes it **inconclusive**.\n- **Recommendation:** Further investigation is **not strongly warranted** unless additional context (e.g., file content analysis, network traffic inspection) reveals anomalies. However, **monitoring** for unusual behavior (e.g., unexpected registry changes, unauthorized file modifications) is advisable.\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided logs.

That's a lot of repeated entries. But then there are several entries from SDXHelper.exe related to file creation. The files are being created in specific paths under the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office SolutionPackages.

I should consider that the user might be dealing with a legitimate software update, but the combination of registry changes and multiple file creations by a helper process could be suspicious. Therefore, this might warrant further investigation to confirm if it's a legitimate activity or a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **1. Normal Activity**\n- **EXCEL.EXE Registry Modifications**:  \n  Multiple entries of `EXCEL.EXE` modifying registry values are likely part of standard Excel operations (e.g., configuration changes, add-in registrations). However, the **repetition** of identical entries (same process, task, and parameters) raises questions about whether this is intentional or indicative of a script or automated process.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n- **SDXHelper.exe File Creations**:  \n  The process `SDXHelper.exe` (associated with Microsoft Office) is creating files in the following directory:  \n  ```\n  C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<Hash>\\PackageResources\\...\n  ```\n  - **File Naming Pattern**:  \n    The filenames (e.g., `kok-in-ui-strings-json`, `lt-lt-ui-strings-json`, `transcription-strings.min.js`) suggest **language-specific UI strings** or localization files. However, the inclusion of **hashes** in the directory path (`f9836956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2`, `36f7956ce5a98ebcbfe2f1e44a38fe2`) is unusual for legitimate Office operations. This could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious payloads.\n  - **Repetition**:  \n    The same files are created **multiple times** (e.g., `lv-lv-ui-strings-json_07aa48624a0778bb5f2a77d657aaf34a.js` appears twice). This redundancy is atypical for standard software deployment and may suggest **malicious persistence** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk Indicators**\n- **Unusual File Paths**:  \n  Files are stored in `SolutionPackages`, a directory typically used for **Office add-ins** or **custom solutions**. While legitimate, the presence of **hashes** in the path and the volume of files created may indicate **unauthorized deployment** of code.\n- **Lack of Context**:  \n  The logs do not include timestamps, user actions, or system context (e.g., whether the user initiated an Office update or installed a new application). Without this, it is difficult to determine if the activity is benign or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**\n- **Investigate Further**:  \n  - Check if the user recently installed Office updates, add-ins, or third-party software.  \n  - Analyze the contents of the created files (e.g., using antivirus tools or static analysis) to confirm legitimacy.  \n  - Monitor for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections to unknown domains, unexpected processes).\n- **Check for Malware**:  \n  The combination of registry changes, repeated file creation, and obfuscated paths may indicate **malware** (e.g., a downloader or backdoor). Run a full system scan with updated antivirus definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., Excel registry changes) may be normal, the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe** with **obfuscated paths** and **language-specific filenames** warrants further investigation. This could be either a **legitimate Office operation** (e.g., a poorly documented add-in) or **malicious behavior** (e.g., a downloader). **Contextual analysis** (e.g., timestamps, user behavior, file contents) is critical to determine the true nature of the activity."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file paths seem to be part of some UI string resources, with different language codes like mi, mr, ms, etc. That's a lot of files being created, but are they normal?\n\nWait, SDXHelper.exe – I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I remember, Microsoft Office might use such helper executables for various tasks, like installing add-ins or handling language packs. However, the sheer number of files being created here is a bit concerning. Normally, you might see a few files being created during an installation or update, but not dozens of them all in the same directory.\n\nAlso, the file names follow a pattern: they're JavaScript files (ending with .js) with unique hashes. That could be part of a legitimate update, but it's also a common tactic for malware to drop files with obfuscated names. The fact that all these files are being created by the same process in a short period might indicate something unusual.\n\nAnother point is that there's one event mentioning a registry key modification by rundll32.exe. While rundll32 is a standard Windows process, it's often exploited by malware to execute malicious code. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just a normal system operation.\n\nBut looking back at the main events, the repeated creation of files by SDXHelper.exe in the SolutionPackages folder raises a red flag. If this is part of a legitimate Office update, there should be corresponding logs from Windows Update or the Office installer. The absence of such logs might suggest that this activity is unauthorized or part of a malicious payload.\n\nAdditionally, the use of multiple language-specific files could be an attempt to bypass detection by varying the content. However, the fact that all files are in the same directory and created by the same process might still be suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities could be normal, the volume and the specific directory involved make this worth investigating further. It's possible that SDXHelper.exe is being used here in an unintended way, or there's a component that's not properly authorized. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting and should be looked into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to the following patterns and anomalies:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **High Volume of File Creations by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Over 20+ files** are created in the same directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fidel\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\{...}\\SolutionPackages\\...`  \n     These files are named with language-specific prefixes (e.g., `mi`, `mr`, `ms`, `mt`, `nb`) and unique hashes (e.g., `mi-ui-strings-json_...js`).\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate Microsoft Office process, but the **volume and repetitive nature** of these file creations are unusual. This could indicate:\n     - A **malicious payload** exploiting the process to drop files (e.g., obfuscated scripts, backdoors).\n     - A **corrupted Office installation** or **unauthorized add-in** generating excessive files.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Naming and Structure:**\n   - The files appear to be **JavaScript files** (`.js`), which could be used for scripting or malicious code execution.\n   - The use of **language-specific prefixes** (e.g., `mi`, `mr`, `ms`) might be an attempt to **obfuscate** the purpose of the files (e.g., mimicking localization assets).\n\n3. **Lack of Contextual Logs:**\n   - No logs indicate **legitimate Office updates**, installations, or user-initiated actions (e.g., no `WindowsUpdate` or `OfficeInstaller` events).\n   - The absence of **parent processes** or **user interaction** (e.g., no `explorer.exe` or `msiexec.exe` context) raises suspicion.\n\n4. **Registry Key Modification by `rundll32.exe`:**\n   - A single event shows `rundll32.exe` modifying a registry key (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\...`).  \n   - While `rundll32.exe` is a standard Windows process, its use here **without clear context** (e.g., no associated `.dll` or legitimate Office operation) could indicate **malware** attempting to persist or modify system behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Activity:**  \n  - High volume of `.js` files in a non-standard directory (`SolutionPackages`).\n  - Files with obfuscated names and language-specific prefixes.\n- **Process Anomalies:**  \n  - `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in bulk without clear user or system-initiated triggers.\n  - `rundll32.exe` modifying registry keys without a known legitimate purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps:**\n1. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan using updated antivirus\/EDR tools.\n   - Analyze the created `.js` files for malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, network communication).\n2. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - Verify the process's legitimacy (e.g., check digital signatures, parent process, and file integrity).\n   - Monitor for further unusual activity from this process.\n3. **Review System Logs:**\n   - Look for additional events related to Office updates, user actions, or system modifications.\n   - Check for network traffic from the affected machine (e.g., connections to suspicious IPs or domains).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `SDXHelper.exe`) may be legitimate, the **unusual volume of file creations**, **obfuscated file names**, and **lack of contextual logs** strongly suggest this warrants further investigation. This could indicate a **malicious payload**, **compromised Office installation**, or **unauthorized software**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are three entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is about a file being created under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with a bunch of characters and numbers, which seems a bit odd. The paths are all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office folder, which is a common location for Office-related files.\n\nHmm, but why are there three entries for the same file? Wait, looking closer, the first entry is for nb-no-ui-strings-json_9fd664616fc08c889151a4d9d2e68d08.js, and the next two are ne-np-ui-strings-json_b754f06fbc4336a5d5ce70e8a18358e8.js. Oh, the second and third entries are the same file. Maybe a duplicate creation? That could be a red flag. Also, the file names have long hashes, which might be part of a legitimate package, but the repetition might indicate something.\n\nSDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? So if it's creating these files, maybe it's part of a normal installation or update. However, the fact that the same file is created twice could be an issue. Or maybe it's just a logging error. But the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation. \n\nI should consider if these file creations are normal. Office sometimes downloads and installs packages, but the repetition might be suspicious. Also, the hashes in the file names are unique, which might be part of a legitimate process. However, the same process creating multiple files in a short time might be part of a malicious activity, like installing a backdoor or something. But without more context, like other events or network activity, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, but all three events are from the same process and same path. Maybe it's a benign process. However, the classification here is about whether the batch is interesting. Since all three are similar and the same process, but the repetition of the same file might not be a big deal. Alternatively, maybe the first file is legitimate, and the others are not. But I don't have enough info. \n\nThe confidence here would be moderate. The justification would be that multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories, possibly legitimate but the repetition could be suspicious. However, since SDXHelper is a known process, maybe it's not a threat. But the system log might be indicating something. I think the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. Not sure, but there's enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files created by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate unusual activity given the process's typical behavior and the repetitive nature of the file creation events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
