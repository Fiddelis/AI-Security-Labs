{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with 'powershell.exe' being accessed or created. The 'Process Create' events show that PowerShell is being executed with a command line that includes several commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users', 'get-childitem', 'dir', 'get-localgroup', and 'net localgroup'. These commands seem to be gathering information about the system's users, groups, and stored credentials. That's a red flag because typically, such commands are used in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThen, there are 'Image loaded' events pointing to various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. While loading .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts, the presence of 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender could be suspicious if it's being loaded in an unusual context. However, I need to check if that's part of normal operations or if it's being used maliciously.\n\nAnother thing is the 'File created' and 'File Delete logged' events. A temporary file is created and then deleted. This could be part of a script's normal operation, but if the file is being used to execute malicious code or store sensitive data, that's a concern. However, the file name here is '__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1', which might be related to a script policy test. That could be benign if it's part of a legitimate script execution, but the combination with the other commands might indicate something else.\n\nLooking at the repetition of the same command line in multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events. That might be a log redundancy or a system event, but I'm not sure. It could be part of the normal PowerShell execution, but the same command being logged multiple times might be indicative of an automated process or a script that's being run repeatedly.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell processes accessing the system, executing commands that gather user and group information, loading various DLLs, and creating\/deleting temporary files. This pattern is consistent with an attacker trying to gather information about the system, which is a common step in privilege escalation or lateral movement. The use of PowerShell for such activities is common in attacks, especially if the commands are designed to extract credentials or system details.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to assume malice without more context. Some of these commands could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple reconnaissance commands, the use of temporary files, and the repeated logging of the same command might suggest a more targeted activity. The presence of 'cmdkey.exe \/list' is particularly concerning because that command lists stored credentials, which could be used to steal sensitive information.\n\nIn summary, while some of these activities could be benign, the overall pattern of system reconnaissance via PowerShell, combined with the creation and deletion of temporary files, points towards a potential security incident. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits patterns consistent with **system reconnaissance and potential malicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern**\n1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance Commands**:\n   - The command line in multiple `Process Create` events includes:\n     - `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, `ls C:\/Users`, `get-childitem`, `dir`, `get-localgroup`, `net localgroup`.\n     - These commands **enumerate users, groups, stored credentials, and file systems**, typical of **information-gathering phases** in attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement).\n\n2. **Suspicious DLL Loading**:\n   - `Image loaded` events reference `.NET` and `Windows Defender` DLLs (e.g., `MpOAV.dll`). While not inherently malicious, **unusual loading contexts** (e.g., in conjunction with reconnaissance commands) could indicate **exploitation of trusted processes** or **malware evasion techniques**.\n\n3. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion**:\n   - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1`) is created and deleted. While temporary files are common, **ephemeral scripts** may be used to **execute malicious payloads** or **avoid detection**.\n\n4. **Repetition of \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n   - The same command line is logged repeatedly in `Provider Lifecycle` events. This could indicate **log redundancy** or **system-level instrumentation**, but the repetition may also suggest **automation** or **script-based exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**: PowerShell is widely used for administrative tasks, and some commands (e.g., `get-localuser`, `dir`) are routine. However, the **combination of commands** and **ephemeral file behavior** raises suspicion.\n- **Windows Defender DLL**: `MpOAV.dll` is part of Windows Defender, but its presence in an `Image loaded` event could be **normal** (e.g., during security scans) or **malicious** (e.g., if loaded by an attacker to bypass detection).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Correlate with Other Logs**: Check for additional indicators (e.g., network traffic to external IPs, unusual user behavior, failed login attempts).\n- **Analyze the Script**: Investigate the deleted temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1`) for malicious content (if recoverable).\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage**: Implement logging and alerts for PowerShell commands that access sensitive data (e.g., `cmdkey.exe`, `net user`).\n- **Check for Privilege Escalation**: Determine if the user executing these commands has elevated privileges, which could indicate **post-exploitation activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events **strongly suggest reconnaissance activity** consistent with **malicious intent**, particularly given the systematic enumeration of system details and ephemeral script behavior. **Further investigation is warranted** to confirm whether this is a legitimate administrative task or part of a security incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. The command lines include things like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', and 'ls C:\/Users' etc. These commands are typically used to gather information about users, groups, and system details. That's a red flag because such commands are often used in reconnaissance phases of an attack.\n\nThen there's the 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' processes running commands like 'net user' and 'net localgroup'. The presence of both 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' might be suspicious. Wait, 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows executable. The legitimate 'net' command is usually 'net.exe', so having 'net1.exe' could indicate a malicious file trying to mimic the real one. That's a potential indicator of compromise.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation events. There's a file created at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_logico.txt' and another at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive'. Creating files in user directories might not be too bad, but if they're part of a larger pattern, it could be concerning. However, the more worrying part is the use of PowerShell for executing multiple system commands, which could be part of an attempt to escalate privileges or gather information.\n\nAlso, the 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, but if it's creating files in unusual locations, that might be worth checking. However, the main issue here seems to be the PowerShell activities.\n\nThe repeated 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management' tasks in the winlog might be related to the commands being run, like modifying user groups or accounts. If these events are part of normal administrative tasks, they might be benign, but combined with the PowerShell commands, it could indicate someone is trying to manipulate user accounts or groups.\n\nNow, considering all these points: the use of PowerShell for reconnaissance, the presence of a suspicious 'net1.exe', and the multiple system commands that could be part of an attack, this seems like a potential security incident. The events are not outright malicious, but they show behavior that's commonly associated with attackers probing a system. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit suspicious activity indicative of potential reconnaissance or initial access phases in a cyberattack. Here's a breakdown of the key concerns:\n\n### 1. **PowerShell Reconnaissance**\n   - **Commands executed**: \n     - `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `cmdkey.exe \/list`, and directory listing commands (`ls C:\/Users`) suggest **system enumeration** (e.g., gathering user credentials, group memberships, and file system details).\n     - These are classic tactics used by attackers to map a target's environment for further exploitation.\n\n### 2. **Suspicious Executable: `net1.exe`**\n   - **Anomaly**: The presence of `net1.exe` (a non-standard variant of the legitimate `net.exe` utility) running commands like `net user` and `net localgroup` raises red flags. \n   - **Indication**: This could be a **malicious dropper or backdoor** mimicking legitimate system tools to avoid detection.\n\n### 3. **File Creation in User Directories**\n   - **Files created**:\n     - `elemento_logico.txt` in `Downloads` and `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive` in AppData. \n     - While file creation alone isn't malicious, **combined with PowerShell reconnaissance**, it may signal **data exfiltration** or **persistent access setup** (e.g., logging keystrokes or storing credentials).\n\n### 4. **Registry Modifications**\n   - **Events**: `Registry value set` by `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` could indicate **tampering with system settings** (e.g., persistence mechanisms, disabling security features, or altering execution policies).\n\n### 5. **Repeated Winlogbeat Activity**\n   - **Context**: While `winlogbeat.exe` is a legitimate log-shipper tool, its activity here (e.g., creating files in non-standard locations) may be **misused for lateral movement** or **data exfiltration** if logs are being manipulated.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis event log is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. The combination of:\n- **PowerShell-based system enumeration**,\n- **Use of a non-standard executable (`net1.exe`)**,\n- **File creation in user directories**, and\n- **Registry modifications**,\n\nstrongly suggests **potential adversarial activity** (e.g., initial access, reconnaissance, or persistence). Further analysis (e.g., checking file hashes, network traffic, and user context) is critical to confirm the threat. \n\n**Recommendation**: Isolate the affected system, block `net1.exe`, and perform a full malware scan."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: RuntimeBroker.exe and a registry value set. That's normal, RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and handles app permissions. Then powershell.exe doing a registry set. PowerShell is common, but using it for registry changes might be normal too, depending on context. \n\nNext, another powershell.exe with Process accessed. Still, not immediately suspicious. Then winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file in the Downloads directory might be part of its setup. But the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which is okay if it's a legitimate installation. \n\nNotepad.exe changing a registry value. Again, not unusual. Then more powershell.exe instances accessing processes. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll from System32. That's a standard DLL, so probably legitimate. Same with Calculator.exe loading the same DLL. \n\nThen, whoami.exe being executed. That's a normal command to check user context, so not suspicious. The rest are more powershell.exe instances accessing processes. \n\nLooking at the overall picture, there's a lot of PowerShell activity, which can be a red flag, but PowerShell is a common tool. The registry changes and process accesses might be part of normal operations or configuration. The winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate. There's no indication of malicious activity like unexpected file downloads, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. \n\nHowever, the repeated use of PowerShell for registry and process access might warrant further investigation, but without more context or other suspicious activities (like unauthorized access, unexpected network connections, or file modifications in sensitive areas), it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting. The confidence is moderate, but since there's no clear malicious behavior, it's probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine system activity including legitimate processes (RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe) and common operations like registry modifications and file creation by winlogbeat.exe. No clear indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
