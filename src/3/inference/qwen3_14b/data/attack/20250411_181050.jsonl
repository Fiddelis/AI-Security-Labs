{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, browsers often do that. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. But then there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe with some certutil commands. Wait, certutil is usually used for certificate utilities, but here it's being used to encode and decode files. The command line shows encoding calc.exe into a temp file and then decoding another temp file into an executable. That's unusual because calc.exe is a normal calculator, but using certutil to encode\/decode might be part of obfuscating malicious files.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of certutil.exe creating files in the Temp directory. The file paths have names like \"modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe\" which seems odd. Also, there's a File Executable Detected event for one of those temp files. That could indicate a malicious file being executed.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe loading PcaSvc.dll with a PcaPatchSdbTask. That might be related to some legitimate Windows update tasks, but sometimes malicious software uses rundll32 to execute code. Also, SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. These are system DLLs, but if they're being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be a red flag.\n\nThe repeated use of certutil for encoding and decoding files, combined with creating executables in the Temp directory, suggests potential malicious activity. The presence of multiple registry value sets and process creations might indicate an attempt to modify system settings or execute payloads. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe are normal, the combination with the certutil and rundll32 activities raises suspicion.\n\nI should check if there's a pattern here. The user might be trying to encode a malicious payload, decode it into a temp file, and then execute it. The use of temp files and the decoding process is a common technique in malware to avoid detection. The confidence level is high because multiple suspicious events are present, even if some are normal processes. So the classification would be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential payload obfuscation), creation of executable files in temporary directories, and unusual process interactions (e.g., rundll32.exe with PcaPatchSdbTask). These patterns are commonly associated with malware execution and lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each line and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries are about chrome.exe doing network connections and modifying the registry. That's pretty normal, right? Chrome often connects to the internet, and registry changes might be part of its normal operation. But there are a few other entries that stand out.\n\nLooking at the sixth event: powershell.exe created a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_auxiliar.txt'. Creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily bad, but it's something to note. Then there's an entry about SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded by an unexpected process, that could be a red flag. However, SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process too. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, so that's probably normal. Then there are multiple entries about powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's a point to consider. But again, it's also a common administrative tool, so context matters.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. The majority are from chrome.exe doing normal activities. The other events involve powershell and SDXHelper, but without more context, like unusual command-line arguments or unexpected behavior, it's hard to say they're malicious. The file creation by powershell is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user activities. The SDXHelper loading urlmon.dll might be normal if SDXHelper is a legitimate application. The winlogbeat activity is also normal if it's part of log monitoring.\n\nBut the presence of multiple registry changes by chrome.exe and powershell might be worth looking into. However, without any anomalies in the events, like failed attempts, unusual paths, or unexpected processes, it's not conclusive. The classification here is tricky. Since there's no clear malicious activity, but some events that could be benign or require further investigation, maybe it's \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a moderate confidence. However, the justification should mention that while some events are normal, others might need more context. But the user wants a single classification for the entire batch. Considering that the majority are normal and the others don't show clear signs of attack, it's probably not interesting. But I should check if any of the events are suspicious. The SDXHelper loading urlmon.dll is okay, and the rest are typical. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve normal chrome.exe network activity and registry modifications. The few non-chrome events (powershell.exe file creation, SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll, winlogbeat.exe file creation) appear to be benign or related to standard system operations. No clear malicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
