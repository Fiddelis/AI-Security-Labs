{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's powershell.exe appearing several times. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the powershell.exe entries: it's modifying the last write time of a file to a specific date. That seems unusual. Changing file timestamps could be part of an attempt to hide malicious activity by altering when files were last modified. Also, there are multiple registry value set events and image loaded events. The image loaded events include some .dll files, which might be normal, but the presence of multiple such events could indicate something's up.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. Creating a temporary file and then deleting it might be part of a script that's trying to execute something without leaving traces. The Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. The combination of PowerShell commands modifying files, multiple registry changes, and temporary file operations could indicate a possible attack. However, I need to check if there's enough evidence. The fact that the same PowerShell process is doing multiple suspicious actions, like altering timestamps and creating\/deleting files, might be a red flag. Also, the use of command-line arguments that look like they're trying to manipulate file properties could be part of an attack chain.\n\nBut wait, some of these events could be legitimate. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, and registry changes can be part of normal operations. However, the combination of these events, especially the file timestamp alteration and the temporary file creation, might be more indicative of malicious behavior. The confidence level isn't 100% certain, but there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So, I think the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.8. The justification would be the combination of PowerShell's suspicious commands, file timestamp changes, and temporary file operations that could be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including file timestamp modification, temporary file creation\/deletion, and registry changes, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines that modify the LastWriteTime of various files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That's a Unix epoch time, which is often used in hacking contexts to reset timestamps. Why would someone do that? Maybe to hide the creation or modification time of files, which could be part of an attempt to cover tracks after modifying or deleting files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be in directories with names like \"modulo_logico\", \"unidade_logico\", \"estrutura_secundario\", etc. These might be part of a specific application or system, but the fact that multiple files across different directories have their timestamps altered could indicate a script or automated process. However, the use of PowerShell to manipulate file timestamps isn't inherently malicious, but when done in bulk or in a suspicious pattern, it can be a red flag.\n\nThen there's the 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' entries, both loading 'urlmon.dll'. That's a normal system file, so unless there's something unusual about the context, this might just be regular activity. The svchost.exe entries with registry value sets are also common, but repeated entries might be worth noting. However, without more context, they might not be significant on their own.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' event creating a new YAML file in the Downloads directory could be part of a legitimate configuration change, but if it's unexpected, it might be worth looking into. However, the main concern here seems to be the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting this together, the repeated use of PowerShell to change timestamps on multiple files across various directories is suspicious. This behavior is often associated with attackers trying to alter evidence. The timestamps being set to a specific date might be an attempt to make files appear older or to mask their actual modification times. While some events are normal, the pattern here points to potential malicious activity. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.8, as there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are modifying file LastWriteTime attributes to a specific date (01\/01\/1970), which is often used in malicious activity to obscure file timestamps.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. Most of these are legitimate processes, but powershell.exe is often used in attacks. Let me check what's happening with powershell.\n\nThe first entry for powershell.exe has a Registry value set. Not sure yet. Then there's another entry where powershell.exe creates a file called \"unidade_logico.txt\" in the Downloads folder. That might be normal, but maybe not. However, the other entries for chrome.exe are mostly registry changes. A lot of them, but maybe that's just normal behavior for Chrome? Although, multiple registry value sets could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys.\n\nWait, there's an entry where chrome.exe loads an image from \"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25030.2-0\\\\MpOAV.dll\". That's a legitimate Windows Defender file, so that's probably okay. But another image loaded is amsi.dll, which is also part of Windows Defender. So those are normal.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. However, the filename is \".winlogbeat.yml.new\", which could be part of a setup process. But if this is unexpected, maybe it's a sign of something else.\n\nNow, looking at the frequency. There are multiple registry value set events for chrome.exe. If Chrome is modifying its own registry keys, that's normal. But if it's modifying other keys, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being changed. Without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is that there are several entries for chrome.exe with Registry value set, but also a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThe presence of powershell.exe with a File created event might be normal, like saving a script or a log. However, if the file is being created in a non-standard location or with unusual content, that's a flag. But the path here is Downloads, which is common for user files.\n\nThe only other thing is the high number of chrome.exe registry events. Maybe that's a sign of a malicious script trying to modify registry settings, but without knowing the specific changes, it's hard to confirm. However, the fact that there are so many events could be suspicious. But maybe the user is just using Chrome normally with many registry changes.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly legitimate processes doing normal things. However, the high number of registry changes by chrome.exe and the presence of powershell.exe might warrant further investigation. But since the confidence isn't extremely high, maybe it's better to classify as \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a moderate confidence. Wait, but the user might be looking for any potential issues. Hmm.\n\nWait, the presence of multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe could be a sign of a malicious payload. But without more information, it's hard to say. The justification should be based on the available data. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, like unexpected files or processes, maybe it's not interesting. However, the high number of events might be a red flag. But I think the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't clearly indicate malicious behavior. The confidence would be around 0.5, but maybe slightly higher. Alternatively, maybe the presence of winlogbeat creating a file and powershell creating another could be part of a setup, but not necessarily malicious. So overall, I think the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal process activities (e.g., Chrome, PowerShell, Calculator) and benign system events (registry changes, file creation). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
