{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then powershell.exe with registry changes. Registry modifications can be a red flag, but sometimes legitimate too. Then there's a process creation of powershell with a command line that's just getting the date. That seems benign. But then there are multiple image loads related to .NET framework DLLs. Those are standard for PowerShell, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nWait, but there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, then immediately deleted. That's interesting. Creating and deleting a script file could be part of an attack, like executing a malicious script temporarily. The file path is in the user's AppData Local Temp, which is common for temporary files, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of something trying to hide its tracks.\n\nAlso, there are several entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. Not sure what those exactly mean, but if they're part of normal operations, maybe not. However, the combination of creating a script file, executing it, and then deleting it could indicate an attempt to run a script without leaving evidence. \n\nAnother thing: multiple image loads from Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. That might be normal if Defender is active, but if there's an unusual number of loads or if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be something else. However, in this case, the logs don't show any errors or unusual activity related to those DLLs beyond normal loading.\n\nThe repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might be part of PowerShell's normal operation, but if they're excessive, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't indicate any anomalies there. \n\nPutting it all together: the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file is the most suspicious part. It could be a red flag for an attacker trying to execute a script and then clean up. However, since the script is just getting the date, it's possible that it's a legitimate test. But the fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might still be worth investigating, especially if there's a pattern of such behavior in other logs. \n\nConfidence-wise, it's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but the combination of events does raise some flags. I'd say it's interesting enough to warrant further investigation, maybe around 0.6 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes loaded .NET framework DLLs and performed file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, which may indicate script execution attempts or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's under AppData, which is a common place for user-specific data. But creating a file there might not be suspicious on its own. However, the next event is another Registry value set by powershell.exe. Then conhost.exe also sets a registry value. Hmm, conhost is usually related to console windows, so maybe that's normal, but combined with PowerShell activities?\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file (.yml.new) might be part of its normal operation. But why is it happening twice? Wait, there are two entries for winlogbeat creating the same file. Maybe a retry or a configuration change?\n\nThen another PowerShell event creating a text file in Downloads. That's \"estrutura_logico.txt\"â€”maybe a log file? Not sure yet. Then another registry set by PowerShell and a Process accessed event. \n\nNow, looking for patterns. PowerShell is involved in multiple events: file creation, registry changes. Registry modifications can be part of malicious activities, like changing settings to persist or disable security features. But are there any red flags here? The files created don't look like obvious malicious files. The paths are in standard locations. However, multiple registry changes by PowerShell might be suspicious. Also, the same file being created twice by winlogbeat could indicate an issue, but maybe it's just part of the setup.\n\nWait, the first event's file path is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's a PowerShell-specific directory for startup profiles. If a user is creating a file there, maybe it's part of their normal use. However, if an attacker is using PowerShell to modify startup scripts, that could be a way to persist. But without more context, like the content of the files or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe conhost.exe registry change is unusual. Conhost is a system process, so changing its registry values might be unexpected. However, without knowing what specific registry keys are being modified, it's hard to assess. \n\nThe repeated file creation by winlogbeat might be a normal part of its operation when setting up configuration files. But if that's happening multiple times, maybe there's an error or misconfiguration. \n\nOverall, the events show PowerShell and other processes making file and registry changes. While some of these could be benign, the combination of multiple registry modifications and file creations by PowerShell might warrant further investigation. However, without more context or indicators of compromise (like unusual file contents, network activity, or unexpected processes), it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple events involving PowerShell and registry changes, which can be indicative of malicious activity. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because some activities could be legitimate. The presence of winlogbeat might be part of a legitimate log setup, but the repeated events and multiple registry changes by PowerShell are suspicious enough to merit further look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating files and modifying registry values, which may indicate attempts to persist or execute payloads. The presence of 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive' and repeated file creation by winlogbeat could suggest either legitimate configuration or potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
