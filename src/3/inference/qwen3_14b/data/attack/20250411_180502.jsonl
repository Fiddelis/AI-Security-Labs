{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. So, the user wants to know if this is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the logs.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the powershell events, there's a command line that starts a process with a batch file path. The paths have some strange parts, like \"..\\\\..\" which might indicate moving up directories. That could be a red flag, maybe trying to access files in parent directories to bypass restrictions. \n\nThen, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading .NET DLLs. Some of these are standard, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET runtime. But others like MpOAV.dll are from Windows Defender. Not sure if that's bad, but maybe the presence of multiple loaded DLLs is normal during script execution.\n\nThere's a File Created and then immediately File Delete event for a temporary script file. That could be part of normal PowerShell operations, like running a script and then cleaning up. But the fact that it's creating and deleting a file quickly might be a tactic to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle events with Start-Process commands are repeated multiple times with different batch file paths. The paths have similar structures with \"..\\\\..\" which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. This could be a sign of malicious activity trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAlso, the Registry value set events for PowerShell might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nPutting this together, the majority of events are from PowerShell with multiple process creations, image loads, and file operations. The repeated use of Start-Process with suspicious paths and the deletion of temporary files might indicate an attempt to execute scripts in a way that's hard to trace. However, some of these activities could be legitimate, like running scripts as part of a software installation or configuration.\n\nBut considering the number of events and the patterns observed, especially the multiple Start-Process commands with obfuscated paths, this seems suspicious. The combination of these events could be indicative of a malicious script trying to execute and clean up after itself. Therefore, the classification should be interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits **suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Concern:**\n1. **PowerShell Script Execution with Obfuscated Paths:**\n   - Repeated use of `Start-Process` with batch files containing paths like `..\\\\..\\\\` (e.g., `C:\\\\estrutura_auxiliar\\\\unidade_comum\\\\..\\\\estrutura_ativo\\\\estrutura_geral_script.bat`).  \n   - The `..\\\\..\\\\` pattern suggests **directory traversal**, potentially to bypass path restrictions or obfuscate the true location of malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Temporary Script File Creation and Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...ps1`) is created and immediately deleted.  \n   - This behavior is **common in malware** to avoid leaving traces on the system.\n\n3. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle` events indicate **script execution** via PowerShell, which is often exploited for malicious purposes (e.g., payload delivery, persistence).\n\n4. **Unusual Registry Modifications:**\n   - `Registry value set` events for `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` and `powershell.exe` could indicate **tampering** or attempts to modify system behavior.\n\n5. **Loading of Defender-Related DLLs:**\n   - While loading `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) is normal, the **frequency** of image loads (e.g., `.NET` DLLs) might suggest **script execution** or interaction with security tools (possibly to evade detection).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malware Execution:** The obfuscated paths and temporary script behavior are consistent with **malware execution** (e.g., downloading and running payloads).\n- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Registry modifications could be part of **persistence** strategies.\n- **Evasion Techniques:** File creation\/deletion and obfuscation may aim to **evade detection** by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate the batch files** referenced in `Start-Process` commands for malicious content.\n- **Analyze the PowerShell scripts** (if recoverable) for suspicious commands or network activity.\n- **Check for unauthorized registry changes** and their impact on system behavior.\n- **Monitor network traffic** during these events for exfiltration or C2 communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and likely part of a **malicious operation**. Further forensic analysis and correlation with other logs (e.g., network, file integrity) are required to confirm the threat. **Immediate investigation is recommended.** \n\n**Classification:** ✅ **Interesting for Investigation** (High Priority)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: Calculator.exe and powershell.exe doing registry value sets. That's normal, maybe? But then there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe. Then an image loaded for MpClient.dll. Wait, MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, right? But why is it being loaded here? Maybe that's normal, but I need to check more.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line for powershell.exe that starts a process with a path that has \"..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\" might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a red flag for directory traversal attacks. That seems suspicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes \"entrada_geral_script.bat\". The paths here are a bit generic, but not necessarily malicious. However, the fact that multiple scripts are being executed from various directories might be worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the file created event for powershell.exe with a path in the user's Downloads folder. Creating a file there isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading payloads, that's a concern. Also, the svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory—maybe that's normal, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to hide.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries have multiple registry value sets and image loads. Loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll are legitimate, as those are part of Windows Defender and antivirus components. However, if chrome.exe is doing a lot of registry changes, that might be unusual. But maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: multiple processes (powershell, cmd, chrome) performing registry modifications, file creations, and image loads. The key suspicious elements are the command lines with potential directory traversal and the execution of scripts from possibly non-standard locations. The use of powershell to start external scripts, especially with those paths, might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code. Also, the fact that there are multiple registry changes could be part of a configuration change by an attacker.\n\nHowever, some of these could be benign, like updates or user-initiated actions. But the combination of script execution from possibly suspicious paths and multiple registry edits raises a flag. I should consider if there's a legitimate reason for these activities. Without more context, the presence of these events might warrant further investigation. So, the answer is that this batch is interesting due to the potential malicious activities indicated by the command lines and registry changes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several **suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Directory Traversal in Command Line**  \n   - A `powershell.exe` process executes a command with a path containing `..\\entrada_comum\\componente_padrao_script.bat`.  \n     - **Risk**: The use of `..` (directory traversal) could indicate an attempt to access files in parent directories, potentially bypassing security restrictions or targeting hidden\/malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Unusual Script Execution**  \n   - Multiple scripts are referenced (e.g., `componente_padrao_script.bat`, `entrada_geral_script.bat`) from non-standard or generic paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads`).  \n     - **Risk**: Execution of scripts from user directories (especially `Downloads`) may indicate unauthorized activity, especially if the scripts are not user-initiated.\n\n3. **File Creation in Sensitive Locations**  \n   - A `powershell.exe` process creates a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\componente_principal.txt`.  \n     - **Risk**: While not inherently malicious, this could be part of data exfiltration or payload storage if combined with other anomalies.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications by Non-System Processes**  \n   - Multiple entries show `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `chrome.exe` performing **registry value set** operations.  \n     - **Risk**: Legitimate processes (e.g., `chrome.exe`) modifying the registry in large quantities could indicate tampering with system settings or injection of malicious configurations.\n\n5. **Image Loads from Antivirus\/Defender Paths**  \n   - `chrome.exe` loads `amsi.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender components).  \n     - **Note**: While normal, this could be a red flag if combined with other anomalies (e.g., bypassing AMSI\/Defender via tampering).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats:**\n- **Malicious Script Execution**: The use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` to run scripts from ambiguous paths may indicate an attempt to execute payloads or tamper with the system.\n- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Registry changes could be used to create persistence (e.g., autorun entries, service configurations).\n- **Data Exfiltration**: File creation in user directories (e.g., `Downloads`) may be part of data collection or exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Scripts**:  \n   - Analyze the contents of `componente_padrao_script.bat`, `entrada_geral_script.bat`, and `componente_principal.txt` for malicious code (e.g., PowerShell commands, network connections, or encryption routines).\n\n2. **Check for Unauthorized Processes**:  \n   - Verify if `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` are running under legitimate user contexts or if they were initiated by unexpected sources.\n\n3. **Monitor Registry Changes**:  \n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals** to trace which registry keys were modified and by which processes.\n\n4. **Check for AMSI\/Defender Bypass**:  \n   - Confirm if `amsi.dll` or `MpOAV.dll` were tampered with (e.g., via hash checks or behavioral analysis).\n\n5. **Network Traffic Analysis**:  \n   - Look for outbound connections from the system (e.g., to C2 servers) during the time these logs were generated.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs shows **highly suspicious activity** that could indicate **malware execution**, **script-based attacks**, or **system tampering**. Further forensic analysis and threat hunting are required to confirm whether this is a legitimate user action or a security incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first seven entries are all about 'chrome.exe' with the task 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' and no file information. That seems a bit odd. Chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe it's normal for some operations. However, seven identical events might be a red flag. Are these legitimate? Maybe, but repeated registry changes could indicate something like a keylogger or other malicious activity trying to alter settings.\n\nThen, there's an entry about 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. The path seems legitimate, and the filename is .yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration. Not too suspicious here.\n\nAnother entry is 'powershell.exe' creating 'elemento_base.txt' in the same Downloads folder. PowerShell creating files isn't unusual, but the name is generic. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's just a normal file creation.\n\nNow, considering all together. The majority of events are the same: chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That repetition could be a sign of something automated. But is that enough? If it's a legitimate application, maybe not. However, if the registry changes are in sensitive areas, that's a problem. But the logs don't specify which registry keys are modified. So, we don't have enough detail here.\n\nThe other events don't show obvious malicious activity. The winlogbeat and powershell entries seem normal. However, the repeated chrome.exe events are suspicious. Without more context, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the user is asking for a classification, I need to decide based on the given data.\n\nI think the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe are the main point of interest here. Even if they're not malicious, they are unusual enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with moderate confidence. The justification is the multiple identical registry events by chrome.exe, which could indicate a potential security issue.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events show chrome.exe modifying registry values repeatedly, which is unusual behavior for a browser and could indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity. Other events involve benign file creation by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe, but the repetitive registry modifications warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
