{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, right? But then there's a bunch of powershell.exe events. Let me check those.\n\nOne of the powershell entries has a command line that starts a process with a script path. The paths look a bit suspicious. For example, \"C:\\\\pacote_comum\\\\objeto_secundario\\\\..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\" â€“ the use of \"..\\\\\" might be trying to traverse directories, maybe to hide the actual path. That's a common tactic in malware to obfuscate the real location.\n\nThen there are multiple image loads related to .NET Framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the script execution, it could be part of a legitimate process. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's often seen in malicious activities where temporary files are used and then erased to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with different script paths. The repetition of similar patterns in the command lines might indicate automated or scripted attacks. The fact that multiple scripts are being executed from different paths could be an attempt to execute malicious code under different contexts.\n\nBut wait, some of these might be false positives. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, the combination of the suspicious file paths, the creation and deletion of temporary files, and the multiple image loads from system directories might indicate something malicious. The use of \"Start-Process\" with these scripts could be part of a broader attack, like downloading payloads or executing commands.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The logs don't show any obvious signs of privilege escalation or data exfiltration, but the unusual process creation and the multiple script executions are red flags. The confidence here is medium because while some activities are normal, the combination and the suspicious paths could point to an investigation-worthy scenario.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing obfuscated scripts with suspicious file paths (e.g., using '..\\\\' directory traversal), temporary file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET Framework DLLs, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look through the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe being used. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. The command lines in some entries have paths that include '..\\', which might be a red flag. For example, the first event has a command line that uses '..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\entrada_base_script.bat'. Using '..' in the path could be an attempt to traverse directories, maybe trying to access files in parent directories that aren't intended to be accessed that way. That might be part of a path traversal attack or trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAnother thing is that there are multiple events with 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. I'm not entirely sure what those tasks mean, but they might be related to system events or service lifecycle management. However, when combined with the PowerShell commands, it could indicate some automated processes or scripts being triggered.\n\nThen there's the 'File created' event where a file is created in the user's AppData directory. While creating files there isn't always bad, it could be part of persistence mechanisms or storing malicious payloads. The file path is 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', which might be related to PowerShell profiles that run automatically, which could be a way for malware to execute without user interaction.\n\nAlso, there are several 'Registry value set' events. Changing registry values can be part of malware configuration, like modifying startup entries or disabling security features. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if these are benign changes or malicious.\n\nThe presence of 'MpClient.dll' being loaded in one of the ImageLoad events. MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that seems legitimate. But other ImageLoad events don't show suspicious paths, so maybe that's okay.\n\nOther processes like chrome.exe and Calculator.exe are normal, but the fact that they have Registry value set events might be normal too, depending on the context. However, the repetition of chrome.exe events might be normal if it's a browser doing regular operations.\n\nPutting this all together, the main red flags are the PowerShell command lines with directory traversal, the creation of a file in the AppData directory, and the multiple registry changes. These could indicate an attempt to execute scripts, persist on the system, or modify system settings. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to be certain. But considering the combination of these factors, it's probably worth investigating further. So the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands with suspicious path traversal (e.g., '..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\...'), and a file is created in the user's AppData directory, which may indicate persistence or malicious activity. Registry modifications and process access events further raise suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a lot of them. But registry changes can be normal, so maybe not suspicious on their own. However, I should check if there's any unusual pattern here. All the chrome.exe events have 'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)' and no file path. Maybe that's normal for chrome, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen there are some image loaded events. For example, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. But MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. So maybe those are just normal operations. But I should check if the paths are correct. The paths here are C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\... which seem legitimate. So maybe those are okay.\n\nLooking at the other processes: cmd.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe. These are common system processes. The svchost.exe created a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder, which is part of Windows Update. That seems normal. The powershell.exe instances created files in the Downloads directory. Creating files in Downloads might be normal user activity, but sometimes malicious scripts do that. However, the filenames here are 'componente_principal.txt' and 'elemento_base.txt', which are just text files. Not obviously malicious.\n\nAnother thing is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. That seems okay.\n\nNow, looking for any signs of compromise. Are there any unusual processes? The chrome.exe events are numerous, but maybe that's because Chrome is a common application. However, if a lot of registry changes are happening from Chrome, that could be a red flag. But without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the image loaded events are for legitimate DLLs. \n\nThe only thing that stands out a bit is the multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe. But since Chrome can modify the registry for various reasons, like updates or user settings, it might not be malicious. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like persistence mechanisms or configuration changes, it could be. But with the given data, there's no clear indication of malicious activity. \n\nThe other events don't show any obvious signs of malware or unauthorized access. The files created are in normal locations and by legitimate processes. So, maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I should check if there's any correlation between events. For example, is there a sequence of events that indicates a compromise? It doesn't look like it. All the events are isolated and don't form a clear attack chain.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that while there are some registry changes and file creations, they are all within normal operations. Therefore, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with medium confidence because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal system behavior (e.g., Chrome modifying registry, legitimate DLLs loaded, file creation in Downloads). No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
