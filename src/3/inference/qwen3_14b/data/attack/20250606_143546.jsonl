My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, FileCreate, and FileDelete. There's also a whoami.exe process. The command line for one of the PowerShell processes looks suspicious. Let me check that line again.\n\nThe command_line field has something like importing a module from a path that includes \"..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of relative paths with multiple dots might indicate trying to access files outside the intended directory, which is a common tactic in attacks. Also, the script is invoking a function called Invoke-entrada_principal, which doesn't ring a bell as a standard PowerShell command. That could be a custom or malicious script.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate, like clr.dll and mscoree.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be normal, but if there's an unusual number of such loads, it could be a red flag. But in this case, it's just a few instances.\n\nThe FileCreate and FileDelete events involve a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a file might be part of a cleanup process, but if the file is malicious, that's a concern. However, the file name here is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1, which sounds like a test script. But the fact that it's created and deleted quickly could be part of an attack to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with ProcessAccess and ImageLoad might indicate that the process is doing more than usual. However, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The key here is the combination of events. The suspicious command line, along with multiple process accesses and image loads, might suggest an attempt to execute a script that's not benign.\n\nAlso, the presence of the Pipe Created event could be part of inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but combined with other events, might be part of a larger attack.\n\nI should also check for any other processes. The svchost.exe events seem normal, related to system updates and registry changes. No obvious signs of compromise there.\n\nPutting it all together, the main red flags are the suspicious PowerShell command line with the relative path and the custom function name, along with the creation and deletion of a temporary script. These could be indicators of an attack, especially if the script is malicious. However, without more context, it's a bit hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, powershell.exe, and others. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, File created, and Image loaded. \n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so seeing it multiple times might be normal. But there's also HxTsr.exe, which I'm not too familiar with. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious software uses uncommon names. \n\nThen there's the file creation events. The sppsvc.exe created a cache.dat file in the System32 directory. That seems okay, but the other files created by svchost.exe are in the SoftwareDistribution folder, which is related to Windows Update. The Metadata files like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., might be part of an update. However, the presence of multiple files being created in that directory could be suspicious if they're not part of a known update. \n\nAlso, the Image loaded events point to urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate DLLs, but if they're being loaded from unexpected locations or by unusual processes, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the processes are svchost.exe and backgroundTaskHost.exe, which are legitimate. \n\nThe powershell.exe events include a File created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, so maybe it's just a normal profile creation. But the Registry value set by PowerShell could be benign or malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe HxTsr.exe process is the only one that stands out. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mindâ€”HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It might be related to some software, but if it's not recognized, that's a point of concern. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple svchost.exe activities are normal, but the presence of HxTsr.exe and the numerous file creations in the SoftwareDistribution folder might indicate something. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity or unusual command-line arguments, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the justification here is that while some events are normal, the combination of HxTsr.exe and multiple file creations in update directories could be worth investigating.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are svchost.exe, which is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. However, there are a few file creation events. Let me check those paths. \n\nOne of the files created is in C:\\Windows\\Logs\\waasmedic\\waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl. ETL files are event trace logs, which are normal for system diagnostics. Another is in SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\Logs\\edbtmp.log, which is related to Windows Update. The other files are in Download directories with long hashes in the names. Those might be temporary files from updates or installations. \n\nNow, the registry value set events are common during system updates or changes. However, svchost.exe is legitimate, but if there's a lot of activity, it could be a sign of something. Wait, but the majority of events are registry changes and file creations. However, the presence of multiple file creations in Windows Update directories might be part of a legitimate update process. \n\nBut wait, there's one entry where the process is None, meaning the file was created without an associated process. That's unusual. The file path is C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsUpdate.20250604.170159.382.7.etl. If a file is created without a process, that could indicate a problem, like a failed update or a malicious activity. \n\nAlso, the other file in the Download directory has a long hash name, which might be a temporary file, but the presence of multiple such files could be part of a legitimate update. However, the combination of the file created without a process and the numerous registry changes might raise a red flag. \n\nI should check if there are any other suspicious activities. The Image loaded event points to taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler, a legitimate component. \n\nSo, the main points are: multiple registry changes (normal for updates), file creations in update directories (normal), but one file created without a process. That might be a sign of something wrong. However, since Windows Update can generate logs and files, it's possible that this is just part of an update process. \n\nBut the confidence here is a bit low. The presence of one anomalous event (file created without a process) might not be enough to classify it as interesting. However, if that's the only anomaly, maybe it's not significant. Alternatively, if there are other signs, but in this case, the rest seem normal. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is that it's not interesting because the events are related to normal system updates and diagnostics. The one file without a process might be a false positive or a legitimate event. Unless there are other signs of compromise, but I don't see them here. So, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events primarily involve svchost.exe (legitimate system process) and file creations related to Windows Update diagnostics (e.g., .etl logs, edbtmp.log).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. Hmm, so the first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to svchost.exe and MpSigStub.exe. Svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services, but when it's creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory, that might be a red flag. Wait, SoftwareDistribution is typically used by Windows Update, so maybe that's normal? But then there's a file named AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe. That looks like a patch file, but the name seems a bit odd. Maybe it's part of a legitimate update, but I should check if there are any suspicious paths or other activities.\n\nThen there are a bunch of files created by MpSigStub.exe in the Windows Temp directory. MpSigStub is part of Windows Defender, so it's involved in signature updates. The files created here include things like mpasdlta.vdm and mpavdlta.vdm. Those are probably definition files for Defender. However, the presence of multiple files being created in Temp might be normal during an update. But wait, the file paths have some odd extensions like .vdm._p. I'm not sure if that's standard. Also, the names like 1.429.372.0_to_1.429.388.0 suggest version numbers, which could be part of an update process.\n\nLooking further, there's setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. The files include ie_to_edge_stub.exe, cookie_exporter.exe, and others. EdgeCore is part of Microsoft Edge, so maybe this is a legitimate installation or update. But why would setup.exe be creating so many files in that directory? It could be part of a normal installation, but sometimes malware uses similar names. However, the presence of elevated_tracing_service.exe and elevation_service.exe might be related to legitimate Edge components, but I need to check if those are known files.\n\nAnother entry is RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is a normal process related to app permissions, so that's probably benign. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. However, without more context like command-line arguments or specific actions, it's hard to tell if this is suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these processes are associated with legitimate Windows components like Defender, Edge, and system services. The creation of files in SoftwareDistribution and Temp directories could be part of updates. However, the specific filenames and the number of files created might warrant further investigation. But since there's no obvious signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual registry changes, or known malware hashes, it's possible that these are just normal system updates. Still, I should note the unusual filenames and consider checking the integrity of the files created, especially the ones in the Temp directory.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs show activity primarily from legitimate Windows processes, but there are a few points that warrant closer scrutiny. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Legitimate Processes with Potential Anomalies**\n- **`svchost.exe` (SoftwareDistribution Directory)**  \n  - **Activity**: Creating a file named `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe` in the `SoftwareDistribution` directory.  \n  - **Context**: This directory is used by Windows Update. However, the filename format (`AM_Delta_Patch_...`) is not standard for typical Windows Update patches. This could indicate:  \n    - A **legitimate update** (e.g., a third-party or Microsoft patch with a non-standard name).  \n    - A **malicious file** masquerading as a patch.  \n  - **Action**: Verify the file's digital signature and hash against trusted repositories (e.g., Microsoft's official update catalog).\n\n- **`MpSigStub.exe` (Windows Defender Definition Updates)**  \n  - **Activity**: Creating `.vdm` and `.vdm._p` files in the `Windows Defender` directory.  \n  - **Context**: These are likely **Windows Defender signature update files**. The `.vdm._p` extension may be an intermediate file during the update process.  \n  - **Action**: Confirm that the files are part of a known Defender update cycle (e.g., via Windows Security logs or event IDs like `1116` or `1117`).\n\n- **`setup.exe` (Microsoft EdgeCore Directory)**  \n  - **Activity**: Creating multiple executables (e.g., `ie_to_edge_stub.exe`, `elevation_service.exe`) in the `Microsoft\\EdgeCore` directory.  \n  - **Context**: These files are likely part of a **Microsoft Edge installation or update**. However, the presence of `elevation_service.exe` and `identity_helper.exe` could be benign if they are legitimate Edge components.  \n  - **Action**: Cross-reference filenames with Microsoft's official Edge documentation or use tools like **Process Monitor** to track file access.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potentially Suspicious Activity**\n- **`powershell.exe` (Process Access)**  \n  - **Activity**: A `ProcessAccess` event is logged, but no command-line arguments or specific actions are mentioned.  \n  - **Context**: PowerShell is a common tool for both **legitimate administrative tasks** and **malware execution**.  \n  - **Action**: Check for additional logs (e.g., `Event Viewer` under **Windows Logs > Security**) to determine if PowerShell was used for suspicious commands (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Download-String`).\n\n- **`RuntimeBroker.exe` (Registry Modification)**  \n  - **Activity**: A registry value was set, but no specific key or value is mentioned.  \n  - **Context**: `RuntimeBroker.exe` is a **legitimate process** that manages app permissions. However, **unusual registry changes** could indicate tampering.  \n  - **Action**: Review the specific registry key modified (e.g., via `Event Viewer` or `Procmon`) to ensure it aligns with expected app behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommendations**\n- **Check File Integrity**:  \n  - Use tools like **Windows Defender Offline** or **Microsoft Safety Scanner** to scan the system for malicious files.  \n  - Verify hashes of suspicious files (e.g., `AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe`) against Microsoft's official repositories.\n\n- **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:  \n  - Enable **PowerShell logging** (via Group Policy or registry settings) to capture commands executed by `powershell.exe`.\n\n- **Review Windows Update Logs**:  \n  - Check **Windows Update logs** (located in `C:\\Windows\\Logs\\WindowsUpdate`) to confirm if the `AM_Delta_Patch_...` file is part of a legitimate update.\n\n- **Investigate EdgeCore Files**:  \n  - Ensure that the `Microsoft\\EdgeCore` directory contains only files from **official Microsoft installations**. Use **File Explorer** properties to check digital signatures.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe observed activity is **largely consistent with legitimate system behavior**, but the unusual filenames and lack of detailed context in some logs (e.g., `powershell.exe`) require further investigation. No clear signs of malware are present, but **proactive verification** is recommended to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first event is 'whoami.exe' being created, which is a normal Windows command, so that's probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' events. The first one is a process access, which isn't necessarily bad. But then there's a registry value set event, which might be suspicious if it's changing settings without user knowledge.\n\nLooking further, there's a process create event with a command line that includes 'New-Service' and 'Start-Service' commands. The service is named 'objeto_ativo' and points to a binary path that's not a standard Windows directory. That's a red flag. Creating a new service and starting it could be part of a persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there are multiple image load events for PowerShell, which is normal, but the paths mentioned like 'mscoree.dll' and 'clr.dll' are part of .NET, so that's expected.

That's common in scripts, but the fact that it's a PowerShell script could be part of an attack. The 'Pipe Created' event might be used for inter-process communication, which could be malicious if not expected.\n\nThe 'services.exe' events are all registry value sets. Since services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's modifying registry values, especially if it's not part of normal system operations, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activities are the creation of a new service with a non-standard path, the temporary file creation and deletion which might be hiding malicious code, and the multiple registry modifications.

The first few entries show the process 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading several .dll files from standard Windows directories like System32 and the .NET Framework folder. Those paths seem legitimate, so maybe that's normal operation. But then I see entries involving PowerShell.\n\nThere's a file created at 'StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', which might be normal, but then there's a registry value set event. However, the more concerning part is the later entries where PowerShell is executing a remote command. The command line shows importing a module from 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The path here is a bit suspicious because it's in a directory named 'unidade_logico' which might be a custom or non-standard location. Also, the use of '..\\\\' in the path could indicate moving up directories, which sometimes is used in attacks to access files in parent directories.\n\nThe repeated execution of the same PowerShell command multiple times might indicate an attempt to persist or carry out some action. The 'Invoke-entrada_principal' command isn't a standard PowerShell cmdlet, so that's a red flag. It might be a custom script or part of a malicious payload. Also, the use of $env:Temp suggests temporary files being used, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be related to the PowerShell module loading, but combined with the unusual file paths and the custom commands, this looks suspicious. The fact that the same command is executed multiple times could indicate an attempt to bypass detection or ensure the script runs despite errors. The presence of error handling with 'catch' and exiting with the exception HRESULT also seems like a way to handle failures gracefully, which is common in malicious scripts.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of loading .NET DLLs, followed by PowerShell executing a script from a non-standard path with custom commands, and the repetition of the same command, suggests potential malicious activity.

The fact that this is done repeatedly, with the same command, might be suspicious. Legitimate software usually doesn't create the same service multiple times. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't immediately ring a bell as a standard service name, which could be a sign of something custom or malicious.\n\nAnother point is the \"Execute a Remote Command\" task associated with the same script file \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" appearing multiple times. This could indicate that the script is being executed remotely, which is often a tactic used in attacks to maintain persistence or execute commands on the system.\n\nThe combination of creating a service with an unusual name, using relative paths in PowerShell, and repeated execution of a remote script might point towards an attempt to establish persistence or carry out some malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them have the same structure. The \"winlog\" field has a task of \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is always 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are a few entries with different tasks like \"Logon\", \"Special Logon\", and \"Security Group Management\", but those don't have a file path specified. \n\nNow, the key thing here is that the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times. The repetition of the same file path and task might indicate something. But wait, is this normal? Well, in a typical environment, executing the same script multiple times could be part of a legitimate process, but it's also a common tactic in attacks. For example, malware might repeatedly execute a script to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The other events are logon tasks and security group management, which are normal administrative activities. But the fact that the same script is executed so many times (like 20 times here) is a red flag. Even if it's legitimate, such repetition is unusual. Also, the script's name, \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\", which translates to \"auxiliary component\" in Portuguese, might be a generic name that attackers could use. \n\nAnother point is that the process field is \"None\" for all the execute remote command events. That might mean that the process information isn't available or wasn't logged properly. This could be a sign of something evading detection, but it's also possible that the logging system just didn't capture the process details. However, combined with the repeated execution, it's more suspicious.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since there's a high number of repeated events with the same file and task, but no other obvious malicious indicators (like network connections, unauthorized access, etc.), it's not 100% certain.

So, first, looking at the data. All the entries are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. The main fields here are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nLooking at the first few entries, the \"process\" is \"None\" for all of them. The \"winlog\" field has a \"task\" key. Most of them have the task as \"Execute a Remote Command\", and the file path is the same each time: 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are 16 entries with that exact same file path and task, except for the last few where the task is \"None\" or \"Windows Update Agent\" and the file is \"None\".\n\nNow, the key thing here is that the same PowerShell script is being executed multiple times. The repetition of the same file path and task might indicate something. If this were a normal system, maybe there's a legitimate reason for repeated executions, but the fact that all these events are the same could be a red flag. Malicious actors sometimes use scripts to perform remote commands, and if that's happening repeatedly, it might be part of an attack.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other information. The process is \"None\" in all cases. That might mean that the process information isn't available, or maybe the event is logged before the process is fully initialized. However, if the process isn't logged, that could be a sign of something evading detection. Also, the file path is in a directory named \"registro_secundario\" which translates to \"secondary registry\" in Portuguese. That might be a red herring or could be a suspicious location if it's not a standard system path. The filename is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" which is \"auxiliary component.ps1\". That doesn't ring any immediate bells, but the repetition is concerning.\n\nThen, there are a few entries where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\" and \"None\". Those might be normal system activities. However, the majority of the logs are the same execution of the same script. The confidence here would depend on how common it is for this script to be executed multiple times. If this is a known benign script, then it's not interesting. But if it's an unknown script being executed repeatedly, that's a high-risk scenario.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided any context about the system or the script's legitimacy, I have to go purely on the data. Repeated execution of the same script with the same parameters, especially if it's a PowerShell script (which is often used in attacks), is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.
