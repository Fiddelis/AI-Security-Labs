So, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries with 'schtasks.exe' creating scheduled tasks. The command lines mention running PowerShell scripts with '-ep bypass', which is often used to bypass execution policies. That's a red flag. The scripts referenced, like 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1', don't exist, which might be an attempt to hide the real payload or a typo. \n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' executing commands to create these tasks, which is unusual. Also, 'powershell.exe' being accessed multiple times, especially with process access events. The creation of files like 'estrutura_geral.txt' and 'entrada_ativo.txt' might be part of data exfiltration or logging. \n\nHowever, there are also normal activities like Chrome and Winlogbeat processes creating files. But the repeated use of schtasks with suspicious PowerShell commands and the non-existing scripts point towards potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because the combination of scheduled tasks, bypassing execution policies, and non-existent files is a common attack pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple schtasks.exe commands create scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts using '-ep bypass' (common in attacks).
