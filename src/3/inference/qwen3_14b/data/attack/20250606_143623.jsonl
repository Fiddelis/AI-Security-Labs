{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. The first few events are Process accessed and Process Create. Then there's a command line that stands out: it's creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a .exe file in a non-standard directory, like C:\\unidade_logico... That seems suspicious because legitimate services are usually in system directories. Also, the service is started right after creation. That's a red flag for potential malware trying to persist.\n\nNext, there are several Image Load events for various DLLs. Some of them are from .NET Framework and Windows Defender, which might be normal. But the presence of multiple image loads, especially from different locations, could indicate that the process is loading unexpected or malicious code. The one from MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Windows Defender, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that might be a concern.\n\nThen there's a File Created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file is a PowerShell script, which might be part of an attack chain where the script is executed and then deleted to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, the repeated Registry value set events for services.exe might be part of modifying service configurations, but since services.exe is a legitimate process, maybe it's being used here. However, the combination with the PowerShell activities suggests something's amiss.\n\nPutting it all together: creating a service with a custom executable, loading various DLLs (some of which are from Defender, which might be a sign of evasion), temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple PowerShell activities. These are all indicators of potentially malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of these events points to an attempt to establish persistence and execute code without leaving evidence. However, I should check if any of these could be benign. For example, Windows Defender DLLs being loaded might be normal, but in this context, combined with the other events, it's more likely malicious. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., creating and starting a service with a non-standard executable path), loading unusual DLLs, and creating\/deleting temporary files—common indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look for any suspicious patterns across all the events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the logs. There's a lot of entries with 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' doing registry value sets. Those are normal system processes, so maybe that's just regular activity. But then there's 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading several DLL files related to .NET, like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. That seems a bit odd. Why would a process named 'tarefa_logico.exe' be loading so many .NET runtime components? That might be a red flag, especially if it's not a known legitimate process.\n\nAlso, there's a 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the AppData directory. While PowerShell is commonly used, creating a startup profile file might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of something suspicious. However, the other entries with 'services.exe' and 'svchost.exe' are all registry changes, which are common for system updates or configuration changes. But the presence of multiple registry events might be normal too, especially if the system is updating or changing settings.\n\nWait, the main thing here is the 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading those .NET DLLs. That's unusual because those DLLs are part of the .NET framework, and if a process is loading them, it might be trying to execute .NET code. But 'tarefa_logico.exe' isn't a standard name. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but the repetition of loading multiple .NET components could indicate something malicious, like a dropper or a loader trying to execute code. However, I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a file created by 'powershell.exe' in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That might be part of normal PowerShell configuration, but if it's being used to set up persistence or execute commands, that could be bad. However, the log doesn't show any command execution, just the creation of the file.\n\nAnother point is that the majority of the logs are from system processes like services.exe, svchost.exe, and MsMpEng.exe (which is related to Windows Defender), doing registry value sets. These are normal for system operations, but the presence of 'tarefa_logico.exe' with multiple image loads is the odd one out. Since the user is asking for the entire batch, the combination of normal system activity and the unusual process loading .NET DLLs might be enough to flag it as interesting.\n\nBut how confident am I? The 'tarefa_logico.exe' could be a legitimate process, but the repeated loading of .NET components might be a sign of something. However, without more context, like the process's origin or any network activity, it's hard to be certain. But given the information, the presence of that process loading multiple .NET DLLs is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification would be the unusual process loading multiple .NET-related DLLs, which might indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The process 'tarefa_logico.exe' repeatedly loads multiple .NET Framework DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc.), which is unusual for a non-.NET process and may indicate malicious behavior such as code injection or exploitation of .NET components.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. So, the user provided a series of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are a lot of entries where 'svchost.exe' is performing 'Registry value set' tasks. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, excessive or unusual registry modifications can sometimes indicate malicious activity, like a worm or a registry-based malware. But on its own, just seeing multiple registry changes by svchost.exe isn't enough to be certain. It could be part of normal system operations or updates.\n\nThen, there are several entries involving 'setup.exe' creating files in the Program Files directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. The files created include msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others related to Edge. Now, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes. However, the presence of multiple files being created in a directory that's part of a software installation (like Microsoft Edge) might be normal during an installation. But I need to check if there are any suspicious elements here.\n\nWait, one of the files is 'show_third_party_software_licenses.bat'. A .bat file in an installation directory might be part of the setup, but sometimes malicious software uses batch files to execute commands. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the fact that setup.exe is creating these files could be part of a legitimate installation process, especially if it's related to Microsoft Edge. But if this is an unexpected installation or if the files are in an unusual location, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother point is that the same setup.exe is also loading an image from 'taskschd.dll', which is part of the Windows Task Scheduler. Image loading from system DLLs is normal, but if it's being done in an unusual context, it might be a concern. However, again, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. There are multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe, which could indicate something trying to alter system settings. Then, setup.exe is creating a bunch of files, possibly as part of an installation. But if this setup.exe is not part of a known legitimate installation, that's a problem. However, the paths mentioned are under Microsoft EdgeCore and Edge, which are legitimate Microsoft products. So maybe this is just a normal installation or update process.\n\nBut why so many registry changes by svchost.exe? If this is part of a legitimate update, maybe the system is being updated, but the sheer number of events might be excessive. However, without knowing the context of the system (like if it's a server or a desktop, or if there was a recent update), it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format. The structure here has 'process' with name, 'winlog' with task, and 'file' details. The 'task' in winlog is either 'Registry value set' or 'File created' or 'Image loaded'. The majority of the events are registry changes by svchost.exe, which is a common process but can be exploited. However, the presence of setup.exe creating files in Program Files might be part of a legitimate installation. But if the setup.exe is not from a trusted source, that's a problem. However, the paths here are under Microsoft, which is a trusted entity.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch includes both normal system activities (like registry changes by svchost.exe and setup.exe creating files during installation) and possibly some that could be suspicious. However, without more context (like if the setup.exe is from an unexpected location, or if the registry changes are outside of normal operations), it's challenging to definitively say it's malicious. But the combination of multiple registry modifications and file creation by setup.exe could be worth investigating further. It's not a clear-cut case, but there are enough suspicious elements to suggest that this might be something that needs closer examination. Hence, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided batch of system events exhibits a mix of **legitimate system activity** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Frequent Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`:**\n   - **svchost.exe** is a legitimate Windows process that hosts system services. However, **repeated \"Registry value set\" events** could indicate:\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., registry-based malware, persistence mechanisms, or worm behavior).\n     - **Legitimate updates** (e.g., Windows updates, driver installations, or software changes).\n   - **Red Flag:** The volume of registry changes may be excessive for normal operations, especially if no corresponding software installation or update is documented.\n\n2. **`setup.exe` Creating Files in Microsoft Edge Directories:**\n   - **Legitimate Context:** Files like `msedge.exe`, `msedgewebview2.exe`, and `show_third_party_software_licenses.bat` are associated with **Microsoft Edge installations**. This could align with a **legitimate software deployment**.\n   - **Suspicious Context:**\n     - The presence of a `.bat` file (`show_third_party_software_licenses.bat`) in an installation directory may be **unusual** for a standard Microsoft Edge installer. Batch files can be used to execute arbitrary commands.\n     - The file path `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore\\137.0.2504.64\\Installer\\setup.exe` suggests a **specific version** (137.0.2504.64) of Edge. If this version is not expected on the system, it may indicate an **unauthorized installation**.\n\n3. **`setup.exe` Loading System DLLs:**\n   - The event **\"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\"** for `taskschd.dll` (Windows Task Scheduler) is **normal** during legitimate installations. However, if `setup.exe` is not from a trusted source, this could be a **red flag** for DLL hijacking or code injection.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- **Low to Medium Risk (Uncertain):** \n  - The events could represent **legitimate system activity** (e.g., Edge installation or update).\n  - However, the **unusual combination** of:\n    - Frequent registry changes by `svchost.exe`.\n    - `setup.exe` creating files in a Microsoft Edge directory with a `.bat` file.\n    - Lack of context (e.g., whether the system is undergoing an expected update or installation).\n  - **Suggests the need for further investigation** to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Verify the Source of `setup.exe`:**\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `setup.exe` and its location on disk.\n   - Confirm whether the file is part of a **known Microsoft Edge installer** or an **unauthorized third-party software**.\n\n2. **Analyze the `.bat` File:**\n   - Examine the contents of `show_third_party_software_licenses.bat` to determine if it executes unexpected commands or references external resources.\n\n3. **Correlate with System Logs:**\n   - Check for **other events** (e.g., process creation, network activity, or user logins) that may contextualize the registry changes and file creation.\n\n4. **Check for Unusual Registry Changes:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Registry Editor** to review the specific registry keys modified by `svchost.exe` and determine their purpose.\n\n5. **Assess System Context:**\n   - Determine if the system is expected to be installing or updating Microsoft Edge. If not, this could indicate a **compromise**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe batch of events is **interesting for investigation** due to:\n- **Unusual registry activity** by a core Windows process.\n- **Potentially suspicious file creation** by `setup.exe` in a Microsoft Edge directory.\n- **Lack of clear context** to confirm whether these events are legitimate.\n\n**Further forensic analysis** is recommended to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve svchost.exe and services.exe performing registry operations. That's normal to some extent because svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts various system services. However, there are multiple entries where setup.exe is involved. Setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes, so that's a bit different.\n\nLooking closer, there are several file creation events under setup.exe. The files created include msedge_proxy.exe, pwahelper.exe, and some shortcut files for Microsoft Edge. Now, Microsoft Edge is a legitimate application, but the presence of these files might be part of a legitimate installation. However, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here.\n\nThe key point here is that setup.exe is creating executable files in standard directories like Program Files and System32. While that's normal for an installer, the absence of other typical installation-related events (like installer processes, download activities, or user interaction) might be a red flag. Also, the logs don't mention any user context or elevation, which could be important. If this was a legitimate installation, there might be more context, like a user initiating the install or other processes related to the setup.\n\nAnother thing is that the registry changes are mostly value sets and object additions. If setup.exe is modifying the registry, that could be part of installing Edge, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that multiple files are created in specific locations might be part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malware also creates files in similar directories.\n\nWait, but the justification needs to be concise. So, the presence of setup.exe creating specific Edge-related executables and shortcuts could be part of a legitimate installation, but the lack of other context (like user initiation, other installation logs) might make it suspicious. However, since Microsoft Edge is a legitimate product, maybe this is just an update or installation. But the logs don't show any obvious signs of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, unusual process behaviors, or other suspicious file modifications. \n\nHmm, but the classification is whether it's interesting. Even if it's a legitimate installation, the fact that setup.exe is creating those files might be normal. However, the absence of other logs (like the setup process being initiated by a user, or other related events) might not be enough to flag it as interesting. Alternatively, maybe the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations by setup.exe could be part of a larger attack, but without more evidence, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the batch is relevant for investigation. So, I need to decide if this is worth looking into. The creation of Edge-related files by setup.exe could be normal, but if there's no other context, maybe it's not suspicious. However, the repeated registry changes by svchost and services might be normal system activity. But maybe the combination of setup.exe creating those files along with registry changes could be a sign of something. However, without more data, it's hard to be certain. \n\nI think the key here is that setup.exe is creating files that are part of Microsoft Edge. If this is a legitimate installation, then it's not interesting. But if there's no context about an installation being initiated, then maybe it's suspicious. However, since the logs don't provide information about the user or other processes, it's possible that this is just a normal installation. Therefore, maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's part of a legitimate process. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if setup.exe is being used in an unexpected way, that could be a red flag. But without more info, it's hard to tell. \n\nWait, the presence of multiple registry changes and file creations by setup.exe might be part of an installation, but the logs don't show any signs of malicious activity. Therefore, maybe it's not interesting. However, the justification should explain that. So, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities appear to be related to a legitimate Microsoft Edge installation, even though the logs are limited.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events involve `setup.exe` creating files associated with Microsoft Edge (e.g., `msedge_proxy.exe`, `pwahelper.exe`, and shortcuts) in standard system directories. While these actions could align with a legitimate software installation or update, the logs lack contextual details (e.g., user initiation, installer metadata, or network activity) to confirm legitimacy. However, **no overtly malicious activity** (e.g., suspicious registry modifications, unexpected process behavior, or anomalous file hashes) is evident. The presence of `setup.exe` performing these tasks is consistent with software deployment, though further investigation would be needed to rule out potential misuse. \n\n**Classification:** `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Justification:** The observed activities appear to align with a legitimate software installation (Microsoft Edge), even though the logs lack explicit context. No immediate indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present."}

Then there are some 'Pipe Created' events also linked to 'setup.exe'. \n\nBut then I see a few entries from 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory with names like APPX followed by random strings. That's a red flag. Typically, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but creating multiple temporary files in Temp might be suspicious, especially if they're part of an installation or exploitation. \n\nAlso, the fact that 'setup.exe' is making so many registry changes could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or install something without proper authorization. The combination of these events—frequent registry changes by setup.exe and unusual file creations by svchost.exe—might suggest malicious activity. \n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, setup.exe might be part of a software installation, and svchost.exe handling temporary files. But the volume and the specific paths (like Temp) might be more indicative of something malicious. \n\nThe presence of both registry modifications and file creation in Temp directories by different processes could be a sign of a multi-stage attack. The confidence isn't 100% because it's possible, though less likely, that these are legitimate activities. But the pattern is concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'setup.exe' processes performing repeated registry modifications and pipe creation, combined with 'svchost.exe' creating numerous temporary files in Windows Temp directories (common in exploitation scenarios).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by svchost.exe. The first event is a file created in the WindowsApps directory for EdgeGameAssist.exe. That seems a bit odd because svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but creating an executable in the WindowsApps folder might not be typical. However, I should check if that's a known legitimate file. Maybe it's part of an update or installation. But then there are multiple entries of svchost.exe creating files in the AppReadiness directory with paths that look like security identifiers (SIDs). Those paths don't seem right. AppReadiness is involved in application compatibility, but creating files with SIDs in that directory is suspicious. Also, the same file is being created multiple times, which could indicate some kind of loop or repeated attempt.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Changing registry values can be a red flag, especially if it's done multiple times. However, svchost.exe is a host process for various system services, so it's possible that these changes are part of normal operations. But the repetition might be concerning.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that's just writing a host message. That seems benign, but the execution policy is set to Restricted, which is the default. However, the next few events show image loads from .NET assemblies. PowerShell loading clr.dll and other .NET components is normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might be part of a script or just normal operation. However, the combination of these events with the previous file creations and registry changes might be more telling.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main points of interest are the repeated file creations in unusual locations by svchost.exe and the registry changes. While svchost.exe can be legitimate, creating files in AppReadiness with SID-like paths is suspicious. Also, the repetition of the same file creation events might indicate an attempt to modify system files or inject code. The registry changes could be part of configuring something, but again, the repetition is a red flag. The PowerShell events don't seem immediately malicious, but they could be part of a larger attack chain. However, without more context, like network activity or other suspicious processes, it's hard to say. But the combination of these events does raise some flags. I would classify this as interesting because the file creations and registry changes by svchost.exe in unusual locations and the repetition could indicate a potential security incident. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 60%, because while some events are normal, the combination and repetition are suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though they do not definitively confirm a security incident. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Unusual File Creations by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - **`EdgeGameAssist.exe` in `WindowsApps`**: While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, creating executables in the `WindowsApps` directory (typically reserved for Microsoft Store apps) is atypical. This could indicate unauthorized installation or tampering.\n   - **Repetitive File Creation in `AppReadiness` with SID-like Paths**: The repeated creation of files in the `AppReadiness` directory (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness\\...`) with paths resembling security identifiers (SIDs) is highly unusual. This may suggest an attempt to exploit or manipulate system compatibility mechanisms.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events by `svchost.exe` could indicate configuration changes. While `svchost.exe` hosts system services, frequent or unexplained registry modifications may point to lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, or tampering.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The `powershell.exe` process runs a benign command (`Write-Host 'Final result: 1'`), but the use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` (the default) does not inherently raise concerns. However, the subsequent loading of `.NET` assemblies (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`) is normal for PowerShell. No malicious payload or suspicious command-line arguments are visible here.\n\n### **Contextual Considerations**\n- **Legitimate Behavior**: Some activities (e.g., `svchost.exe` managing services, PowerShell loading .NET libraries) are normal. However, the **repetition** of file creation events and the **unusual file paths** deviate from typical patterns.\n- **Lack of Clear Malicious Indicators**: No direct evidence of malware (e.g., suspicious binaries, network connections, or privilege escalation) is present in the logs.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs are **moderately suspicious** due to the **unusual file operations** and **repetitive registry changes** by `svchost.exe`. While these could stem from benign system updates or misconfigurations, the patterns warrant further investigation (e.g., checking file hashes, reviewing system integrity, analyzing associated processes). \n\n**Recommendation**: Investigate the file creation events in `AppReadiness` and verify the legitimacy of the files. Monitor for additional anomalous activity by `svchost.exe` or PowerShell.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **Medium (60%)** – Suspicious patterns are present, but definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed without additional context."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with 'powershell.exe' and different tasks. The first one mentions 'Image loaded' pointing to MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, right? So maybe that's normal. But then there's a 'File created' event with a .psm1 file in the Temp directory. PowerShell scripts in Temp can be suspicious, especially if they're created by PowerShell itself. But maybe it's part of a legitimate process?\n\nThen there's a 'Pipe Created' event, which might be normal, but combined with other events... Hmm. The next entries have 'Image loaded' for clrjit.dll and other .NET files. Those are standard for PowerShell, so probably not a problem. But then there's a 'Process accessed' event. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'Process Create' event for whoami.exe, which is a standard tool. But then there's another PowerShell process with a long command line that checks for INF files. The command line seems to be scanning for defaultinstall sections in INF files. That might be part of a script checking for something, but why would that be suspicious? Maybe it's trying to find installation sections that could be exploited?\n\nWait, the command line uses Get-Item on all INF files in the WinDir\/inf directory. Then it checks each INF content for a regex that matches defaultinstall sections for different architectures. The script then outputs a result. That seems odd. Why would PowerShell be doing that? Maybe it's part of a malicious script trying to find installation configurations to modify or exploit. But is that a common legitimate activity? Not sure. Maybe it's part of a legitimate tool, but the presence of such a script might be unusual.\n\nAlso, there are multiple Image Load events for .NET assemblies and Windows Defender files. However, the repeated creation of .psm1 files in Temp and the unusual PowerShell command could indicate something. The fact that the same MpOAV.dll is loaded twice might be normal if the process is running multiple times. But the FileCreate events for .psm1 files might be more concerning. These files are PowerShell script modules, and creating them in Temp could be a sign of script execution that's not supposed to be there.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the majority of events are related to PowerShell. While PowerShell is a common tool, excessive activity or unusual commands could be a red flag. The command line in one of the entries is trying to check INF files for specific patterns, which might be part of a larger attack, like modifying installation processes. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But combined with the file creations, it might be worth looking into.\n\nSo, putting it all together: multiple PowerShell events, creation of temporary script files, and a command that's scanning INF files for specific sections. While some of these could be legitimate, the combination might indicate an attempt to manipulate or exploit system configurations. Therefore, this batch might be interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating temporary .psm1 files in the Temp directory, combined with a suspicious command-line script scanning INF files for architecture-specific installation patterns, suggests potential malicious activity or unauthorized script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": \"MODERATE\"\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I'll look through the events to see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. The file path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25050.5-0\\MpClient.dll. Hmm, that's a legitimate Windows Defender file. But wait, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. But in this case, the file is from the expected location, so maybe it's normal. But I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command that disables the Windows Defender feature using Dism. The command line is \"Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet\". Disabling Windows Defender could be suspicious if it's done without authorization. But maybe it's part of a legitimate system change, like a configuration script. However, removing Defender might be a red flag because it's a security tool. But I need to see if other events support this.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where Dism.exe is creating or detecting executable files in the user's Temp directory. The files are things like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, etc. These are all DLLs and executables. The fact that Dism is creating these files in the Temp folder might be normal during an update or deployment. But the fact that there are so many files being created here could be suspicious. Also, the paths are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nWait, but the Dism tool is used for deployment and imaging, so it's possible that these files are part of a legitimate operation. However, the combination of disabling Windows Defender and creating numerous executable files in Temp might indicate something malicious. The user might be trying to remove security features and then execute code from a temporary location, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother point is that the first event involves PowerShell loading a DLL from Windows Defender. If that DLL is legitimate, it's normal. But if the process is being used to load a malicious DLL, that's bad. However, the path here is correct, so maybe that's not the issue. But the other events about disabling Defender and creating files in Temp might be the key points.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Disabling Windows Defender could be a sign of an attacker trying to bypass security. Then, using Dism to create multiple executables in the Temp directory might be part of an installation or attack. The presence of many executable files in a temporary directory, especially when combined with the removal of a security tool, raises suspicion. Therefore, these logs might be interesting for investigation because they could indicate an attempt to compromise the system by removing defenses and executing code from a temporary location.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries are **interesting for investigation** due to the following suspicious patterns:\n\n1. **Disabling Windows Defender**:  \n   The `cmd.exe` command uses **DISM** to disable the **Windows Defender** feature (`\/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove`). This is highly unusual in a standard environment and may indicate an attempt to **remove a critical security layer**, potentially to evade detection by malware or during a system compromise.\n\n2. **Unusual File Activity with DISM**:  \n   The **DISM** process is creating or detecting numerous executable files (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `DismHost.exe`, `CbsProvider.dll`, etc.) in the **user's temporary directory** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). While DISM is a legitimate tool for deployment, the **volume of files** and their **execution from a temporary directory** (a common tactic for malware) raises suspicion. This could indicate:\n   - **Malware installation** (e.g., staged payloads in Temp).\n   - **Tampering with system tools** (e.g., replacing legitimate DLLs with malicious ones).\n\n3. **PowerShell Interaction with Windows Defender DLL**:  \n   The first event shows **PowerShell** loading `MpClient.dll` from the **Windows Defender** directory. While this DLL is legitimate, the context (combined with the above DISM activity) could suggest **misuse of a trusted process** for malicious purposes (e.g., code injection or DLL hijacking).\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters**:\n- **Security Evasion**: Disabling Defender is a clear indicator of an attacker attempting to **bypass host-based security**.\n- **Suspicious File Behavior**: The creation of multiple executables in Temp, especially during a DISM operation, is **unusual** and may point to **malware execution** or **toolchain tampering**.\n- **Lateral Movement\/Command-and-Control**: Temporary files are often used as staging areas for **malware communication** or **payload execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation**:\n- **Check for unauthorized changes** to system policies or group policies that disable Defender.\n- **Analyze the Temp directory files** for signs of malware (e.g., YARA rules, entropy analysis, or sandboxing).\n- **Correlate with other logs** (e.g., network traffic, registry changes) to determine if this is part of a broader attack.\n- **Verify the legitimacy of the DISM operation** (e.g., check if it was initiated by a trusted user\/administrator).\n\n**Conclusion**: These logs warrant further investigation due to the **unusual combination of security tool disablement and suspicious file activity**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\". Each event mentions a different DLL file in the Temp directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nHmm, the fact that there are multiple files being detected here might be normal if Dism is part of a Windows update or image deployment process. However, the Temp directory is a common place for malware to store temporary files. But wait, the files here have .mui extensions, which are Microsoft UI language resource files. Those are typically part of the operating system, not user-installed applications. \n\nBut why are so many of them being detected by Dism.exe? Dism usually handles .dll files, but .mui files are usually for language packs. Maybe this is part of a legitimate operation, like applying language packs or updates. However, the sheer number of files (15 entries) might be a red flag. Could this be a case of a malicious actor using Dism to execute or load malicious code disguised as legitimate DLLs?\n\nWait, the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" might be a custom rule or part of a specific security solution. If the system is detecting these as executable files, but they're actually .mui files, that might be a false positive. Alternatively, maybe the detection is correct, and these files are actually malicious. But .mui files are usually not executable. However, if the detection rule is flagging them as executable, that could indicate a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the path is in the Temp directory, which is temporary. If these files are being created and executed from Temp, that's suspicious. Legitimate processes might use Temp, but multiple files being created in a short time could be indicative of an attack. However, Dism is a trusted process, so maybe it's part of a legitimate operation.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if this is a potential security threat. Considering that all these files are .mui and not .dll, and they are being detected by Dism, which is a legitimate tool, it's possible that this is a false positive. However, the presence of multiple files in Temp might still be concerning. Alternatively, maybe the detection is a mistake, and the files are harmless.\n\nIn conclusion, while the presence of multiple files in Temp is suspicious, the fact that they are .mui files associated with Dism, a legitimate tool, might mean this is a false positive. However, further investigation is needed to confirm if these files are indeed legitimate or if there's an underlying threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **`Dism.exe`** process, a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images, detecting multiple **`.mui`** (Microsoft UI language resource) files in the **`Temp`** directory. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Tool**: \n   - **`Dism.exe`** is a trusted Windows utility, commonly used during system deployment, imaging, or updates. It often interacts with system files, including `.dll` and `.mui` files, especially when handling language packs or updates.\n\n2. **File Type and Location**:\n   - The detected files are **`.mui`** files, which are **language resource files** for Windows UI elements (e.g., localized strings for system components). These are typically part of the OS or language packs, not user-installed applications.\n   - The **`Temp`** directory is a common location for temporary files, but **legitimate processes** (like `Dism.exe`) may use it during operations. However, **malware** also frequently uses `Temp` to store transient files.\n\n3. **Detection Rule**:\n   - The **\"FileExecutableDetected\"** rule may be flagging these `.mui` files as executable. This could be a **false positive**, as `.mui` files are **not executable** (they are data files). Alternatively, the detection might be triggered by **unusual behavior** (e.g., `Dism.exe` accessing a large number of `.mui` files in `Temp`).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Volume**: \n  - **15 distinct `.mui` files** being detected by `Dism.exe` in a short time frame could be **unusual** if they are not part of a known legitimate operation (e.g., applying a language pack or update). This might indicate **malicious activity**, such as:\n    - **Malware disguising itself as legitimate system files**.\n    - **Tampering with system processes** (e.g., injecting malicious code into `Dism.exe` or its associated files).\n\n- **False Positive**:\n  - If the system is undergoing a **Windows update** or **language pack installation**, this behavior could be **legitimate**. However, this would typically be a **one-time or limited** event, not 15 separate detections.\n\n- **Path and Permissions**:\n  - The files are in the **user-specific `AppData\\Local\\Temp`** directory, which is **less restricted** than system-wide directories. While this is normal for temporary files, it could be exploited by malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with System Activity**:\n   - Check if **Windows Update** or **language pack installation** is in progress. If not, investigate further.\n\n2. **Analyze File Signatures**:\n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **VirusTotal** to scan the `.mui` files for malicious signatures. Legitimate `.mui` files are typically signed by Microsoft.\n\n3. **Monitor `Dism.exe` Behavior**:\n   - Use **Process Monitor** or **Sysinternals tools** to trace what `Dism.exe` is doing with these files. Look for **unusual network activity**, **file modifications**, or **registry changes**.\n\n4. **Check for Tampering**:\n   - Verify the **integrity of system files** using **System File Checker** (`sfc \/scannow`) and **DISM repair** commands (`DISM \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/RestoreHealth`).\n\n5. **Review Security Logs**:\n   - Look for **failed login attempts**, **unauthorized access**, or **unusual process creation** around the time these events occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile **`Dism.exe`** is a legitimate process, the **high volume of `.mui` files** in **`Temp`** being detected by the **\"FileExecutableDetected\"** rule raises **caution**. This could be a **false positive** during a legitimate system operation, but it may also indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., malware mimicking legitimate processes). Further investigation is recommended to confirm the legitimacy of the files and the behavior of `Dism.exe`."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The winlog task is \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each entry has a file path in the user's Temp directory with various DLL files.\n\nHmm, the fact that multiple DLLs are being detected here might be normal if Dism is part of a system imaging process. But wait, the files are in the Temp folder, which is a common place for temporary files. However, the presence of multiple DLLs with names like SmiProvider.dll.mui, SysprepProvider.dll.mui, etc., could be part of a legitimate operation, such as sysprep or image deployment. \n\nBut I should be cautious. Malware sometimes uses the Temp directory to store malicious files. However, since all the files are being detected by Dism.exe, which is a trusted process, this might be part of a legitimate system task. However, the repetition of the same directory structure and the fact that all are being flagged by the same rule might indicate something. \n\nWait, the rule is \"FileExecutableDetected\", which might be a custom rule. If the system is configured to log any executable files detected, and Dism is a legitimate tool, this could be normal. But maybe the system is misconfigured, or the files are not supposed to be there. \n\nAlternatively, if these DLLs are being loaded by Dism.exe as part of a legitimate process, then it's okay. However, if these DLLs are not part of the standard Windows installation, that could be suspicious. But without more information, like hashes or reputation checks, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn a typical scenario, Dism.exe might interact with various providers during imaging, so these DLLs could be part of that. But since they're in the Temp directory, maybe they were downloaded or generated during the process. \n\nConsidering the user's perspective, if this is a normal system operation, then it's not a threat. But if this is an unexpected activity, especially if the user hasn't initiated any imaging tasks, that could be a red flag. \n\nHowever, based solely on the provided information, the events are generated by a legitimate process, even though the Temp directory is involved. The key is whether these files are expected in that context. Since the system might be performing a sysprep or image capture, which involves multiple providers, this could be normal. \n\nBut I should also consider that the rule might be flagging these files unnecessarily. However, without more context, the best conclusion is that these are likely legitimate, but should be monitored to ensure they're part of expected activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **Dism.exe** process (a legitimate Windows tool for deployment and imaging) detecting multiple **DLL files** in the user's **Temp directory**. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Process:**  \n   - **Dism.exe** is a trusted Windows utility used for tasks like system imaging, deployment, and sysprep. Its involvement suggests the activity may be part of a legitimate system operation (e.g., imaging, deployment, or configuration).\n\n2. **File Paths and Names:**  \n   - The files (e.g., `SmiProvider.dll.mui`, `SysprepProvider.dll.mui`, `ImagingProvider.dll`) are named similarly to **Windows Imaging Provider** components, which are part of the **Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD)** or **sysprep** processes.  \n   - The presence of `.mui` (Multilingual User Interface) files is normal for localized system components.\n\n3. **Temp Directory Usage:**  \n   - Temporary directories are commonly used by legitimate processes for transient files. However, this location is also a common target for malware to execute or store payloads, though **no evidence of malicious activity** is present here.\n\n4. **Rule Context (\"FileExecutableDetected\"):**  \n   - If this rule is part of a **custom security monitoring system**, it may flag any executable file creation or modification. However, **Dism.exe** is a legitimate process, and the files in question are likely **expected artifacts** of its operation.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Scenarios:**\n- **Legitimate System Activity:**  \n  The files could be part of a **sysprep**, **image capture**, or **deployment task** initiated by an administrator or automated tool. The Temp directory is often used temporarily during such operations.\n\n- **Misconfigured Monitoring Rule:**  \n  If the rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" is overly broad, it might flag **legitimate files** (e.g., DLLs used by Dism) as suspicious, even though they are not malicious.\n\n- **Unusual Behavior (If Not Expected):**  \n  If **no imaging\/deployment tasks** were initiated, the presence of these files might warrant further investigation (e.g., checking file hashes, parent processes, or network activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with System Context:**  \n   - Check if **sysprep**, **image deployment**, or **Windows Update** activities were recently initiated.  \n   - Review system logs for related events (e.g., **Event Viewer** under *Windows Logs > System*).\n\n2. **Verify File Integrity:**  \n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM systems** to check the **hashes** of the DLLs against known good values or malware databases.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies:**  \n   - If these files are **unexpected**, monitor for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network connections, unauthorized process execution).\n\n4. **Review Rule Configuration:**  \n   - If the \"FileExecutableDetected\" rule is part of a custom security system, ensure it is **not overbroad** and excludes known legitimate processes\/files.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **likely legitimate**, given the involvement of **Dism.exe** and the naming of the files. However, **contextual analysis** is critical. If the system is **not undergoing imaging\/deployment tasks**, further investigation is warranted. **No immediate malicious activity** is evident from the provided data."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events involve Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. However, the presence of multiple files being detected as executable in the Temp directory might be suspicious. The files like ProvProvider.dll, SetupPlatformProvider.dll, etc., are all in the same temporary folder. That's a common tactic for malware to store temporary files in a location that's expected to have transient data, making it harder to detect.\n\nThen there's the DismHost.exe process. The command line shows a GUID, which might be part of a legitimate operation, but combined with the loading of various DLLs from the same Temp directory, it could indicate that these DLLs are being loaded into memory. The fact that multiple ImageLoad events are logged for these DLLs suggests that the process is loading several modules, which might be normal for Dism, but the sheer number and the location of the files might be a red flag.\n\nNow, I need to check if these are all legitimate. Dism does use various providers and DLLs, but typically, they might be part of the system's installation media or part of a Windows image. However, if these DLLs are being loaded from the user's Temp directory instead of system directories, that's unusual. The Temp directory is a common place for malware to stage files, so this could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, could this be part of a legitimate Windows operation? For example, during sysprep or image deployment, Dism might generate temporary files. However, the presence of so many DLLs being loaded from the same Temp folder might be more indicative of a malicious payload. Also, the fact that the DismHost.exe is being created and loading these modules might be part of a legitimate process, but the combination of events could be a sign of something more sinister.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the events include both FileCreated and ImageLoaded. If the files were created by a legitimate process, that's okay. But if they were created by a different process, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't show the parent process creating these files. The logs only show the DismHost.exe loading them. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but the location of the files in the Temp directory is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the use of the Temp directory for storing executable files could be a sign that the attacker is trying to avoid detection. Since Temp directories are expected to have temporary files, it's a common place for malware to hide. Therefore, the combination of Dism-related processes loading multiple DLLs from the Temp directory might be a sign of a compromised system.\n\nIn conclusion, while Dism and DismHost are legitimate tools, the pattern of loading multiple DLLs from the Temp directory, especially with names that resemble system components but stored in a user-writable location, is suspicious. This could indicate a malicious activity, such as a dropper or a loader that's using legitimate processes to execute malicious code. Therefore, this batch of events is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries involve a sequence of events related to **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe**, which are legitimate Windows tools used for deploying and managing Windows images. However, the pattern of activity raises **red flags** that warrant further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Multiple Executable Files in Temp Directory:**\n   - **Dism.exe** is logging events for **numerous DLLs** (e.g., `ProvProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`, etc.) being created in the **user's Temp directory** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). \n   - This is **unusual**, as legitimate system components are typically stored in system directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`), not in user-specific Temp folders. The Temp directory is a **common location for malware to stage files**, making this suspicious.\n\n2. **Image Load Events for DLLs from Temp:**\n   - **DismHost.exe** is loading multiple DLLs (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `DismProv.dll`, `OSProvider.dll`, etc.) from the **same Temp directory**. \n   - While Dism and DismHost can load modules, **loading multiple DLLs from a Temp directory** is **not typical** for legitimate operations. This could indicate **malicious code being injected** into memory via these DLLs.\n\n3. **Unusual Command-Line Argument:**\n   - The `DismHost.exe` process is launched with a **GUID** (`{3A6E6E1C-7E5E-4B9D-9F6A-1D3A6E6E1C7E}`) in the command line. While this could be part of a legitimate Windows operation, it is **not a standard argument** for DismHost and may indicate **custom or malicious behavior**.\n\n4. **Lack of Parent Process Context:**\n   - No information is provided about the **parent process** that created the Temp files or launched DismHost.exe. This absence of context makes it **difficult to determine if the activity is legitimate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Suspicious File Location:** DLLs and executables in the Temp directory instead of system directories.\n- **Unusual DLL Loading:** Multiple image-load events for non-system DLLs from a Temp folder.\n- **Lack of Transparency:** No clear parent process or context for the activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Behavior:**\n- **Legitimate:** Dism and DismHost are used during Windows deployment, imaging, and sysprep. They may temporarily generate files in Temp directories during these processes.\n- **Malicious:** The **combination of events** (Temp files, multiple DLLs, lack of context) **strongly resembles behavior seen in malware droppers or loaders** that exploit legitimate tools to execute malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate Further:**\n   - Check if the Temp files are part of a known legitimate Windows operation (e.g., sysprep, image deployment).\n   - Analyze the **hashes of the Temp files** to determine if they match known malware or legitimate binaries.\n   - Use **process tree analysis** to identify the **parent process** that created these files.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n   - Watch for **unusual use of Dism\/DismHost** outside of Windows deployment contexts.\n   - Flag **unexpected DLL loading** from Temp directories.\n\n3. **Security Controls:**\n   - Restrict **write access to Temp directories** for non-admin users.\n   - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to monitor for suspicious process behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **Dism.exe** and **DismHost.exe** are legitimate tools, the **pattern of activity** (Temp directory files, multiple image-load events, lack of context) is **highly suspicious** and could indicate a **compromise**. This warrants **immediate investigation** to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about the 'DismHost.exe' process loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. Then there's a termination event for DismHost.exe. Later, there are events from 'Dism.exe' deleting some of those DLLs that were loaded earlier.\n\nNow, I need to think about what's normal here. DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool, which is used for Windows image management. It's common for DISM to load various providers (those DLLs) when performing tasks like applying updates or configuring images. The temporary directory path is typical for such operations, as they often use temporary files.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple DLLs are being loaded from the same temporary directory might be a red flag. But wait, in the case of DISM, it's expected to use these providers. The deletion of the DLLs by Dism.exe after they're no longer needed is also a normal part of the process. \n\nBut here's a thought: if these DLLs were not supposed to be there, or if they're being loaded in an unusual context, that could be malicious. However, the events don't show any signs of unexpected behavior. The process names are legitimate, the files are in the expected location, and the actions (loading and deleting) align with typical DISM operations.\n\nAnother angle: the repetition of the same temporary directory across all events might be normal for a single DISM operation. The fact that DismHost.exe is terminating after loading all those DLLs could be part of a script or command that's being executed. But without more context, like other processes or network activity, it's hard to tell.\n\nI should also check if any of the DLL names are suspicious. The names like SysprepProvider.dll and SetupPlatformProvider.dll do sound like they could be part of legitimate setup processes. However, the presence of TransmogProvider.dll is a bit odd. Wait, Transmog is a term I've heard in the context of game modding, but maybe in this case, it's a legitimate provider name. I might need to verify that, but given the context of DISM, it's possible.\n\nConsidering all this, the events seem to be part of a normal DISM operation. The loading of providers, their subsequent deletion, and the termination of the process are all expected behaviors. Unless there's additional information indicating otherwise, like unexpected network connections, unusual command-line arguments, or other anomalous processes, these events don't point to a security threat.\n\nTherefore, the batch of events is likely a normal system activity related to DISM and doesn't require further investigation unless there are other indicators of compromise present.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events appears to represent **normal system activity** related to the **Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM)** tool, which is used for Windows image management. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Processes**:\n   - **`DismHost.exe`** and **`Dism.exe`** are core components of DISM, used for managing Windows images (e.g., applying updates, configuring settings).\n   - The temporary directory path (`C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`) is standard for DISM operations, as it often uses temporary files during image processing.\n\n2. **Expected Behavior**:\n   - **Loading DLLs**: The numerous `*.Provider.dll` files (e.g., `IntlProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) are **DISM providers**—modules that extend DISM's functionality for tasks like language packs, sysprep, and setup platform operations. These are loaded dynamically during DISM workflows.\n   - **File Deletion**: The subsequent deletion of these DLLs by `Dism.exe` is consistent with DISM cleaning up temporary files after completing a task.\n\n3. **No Suspicious Indicators**:\n   - **No anomalies**: The events align with typical DISM workflows (e.g., loading providers, terminating processes, deleting temporary files).\n   - **No malware signatures**: The file names (e.g., `TransmogProvider.dll`, `SetupPlatformProvider.dll`) are not inherently suspicious in this context. While \"Transmog\" might raise eyebrows, it is not a known malicious term here and could be a legitimate provider name.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Not Interesting for Investigation**  \nThe events reflect standard DISM operations. Unless additional context (e.g., unexpected network activity, unusual command-line arguments, or unrelated processes) is present, these logs do not indicate a security threat."}

It's commonly used in tasks like Windows Update or system image management. However, the fact that so many files are being deleted here might be suspicious. But wait, maybe this is part of a normal operation. For example, when you run DISM commands, it might generate temporary files that are later deleted.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files. The GUID in the path suggests that this is a unique session or operation. The files being deleted include DLLs and MUI files, which are language-specific resources. But again, that's common during installation or update processes.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of deletions might be a red flag. If this were a malicious activity, the attacker might be cleaning up after deploying malware, but since all the files are associated with Dism.exe, it's more likely part of a legitimate process. The one event about changing the file creation time could be a normal part of the process, maybe updating timestamps after modifying files.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's any anomaly. For example, if Dism.exe is deleting files that aren't supposed to be there, or if the deletions are happening in an unusual context. However, the logs don't show any other processes or events that would indicate malicious activity. All events are related to Dism.exe, which is a trusted process.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the number of deletions is high, the context points to a legitimate use of Dism.exe.

Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"classification\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"All events involve legitimate Windows Deployment Imaging (DISM) operations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. All the events are about files being deleted by Dism.exe. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific UUID folder, and they have names like IBSProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll.mui, etc. \n\nFirst, I know that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment. It's common during system setup or image customization. However, the deletion of multiple .mui files (which are language resource files) might be part of a normal process, like cleaning up after a deployment.\n\nBut wait, why so many files being deleted in one go? The path is in the Temp folder, which is typical for temporary files. However, if this is part of a legitimate operation, there might be corresponding creation or modification events. But in the given logs, only deletions are present. \n\nI should consider if there's any suspicious pattern. The fact that all these files are being deleted by Dism.exe might be normal if, for example, the system is being imaged or customized. But if there's no prior event indicating that a deployment is happening, this could be unusual. \n\nAnother angle: are these .mui files expected to be there? Since they're in the Temp directory, maybe they were temporary files created during a process and then cleaned up. However, the large number of deletions might be a red flag. \n\nBut I also need to think about the confidence level. If the user is running a deployment tool, this is normal. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, the system log rule is FileDeleteDetected, which might be part of a security monitoring system. If the system is configured to alert on file deletions, this might trigger an alert. \n\nBut the presence of multiple deletions by a legitimate process might not be malicious. However, the absence of other events (like file creation) might make this suspicious. Maybe the files were created elsewhere and then deleted, but the logs only show deletions. \n\nAlternatively, if Dism.exe is being used in an unexpected way, maybe by an attacker, but that's less likely. The key is that Dism.exe is a legitimate tool, so unless there's other evidence, this might be normal. \n\nBut the fact that all these files are being deleted could be part of a normal cleanup. However, if this is happening outside of a known deployment process, it could be an issue. Since the logs only show deletions, and no context about a deployment, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn the absence of more information, the safest conclusion is that this might be a legitimate process, but it's worth investigating further to confirm if it's part of an expected operation.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All the events are about files being deleted by Dism.exe, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and imaging. The files are in the Temp directory under a specific UUID folder. The names of the files all end with .dll and seem to be provider-related, like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc.\n\nHmm, deleting multiple provider DLLs from the Temp folder might be part of a normal system update or cleanup process. However, I should check if this is unusual. Typically, Dism.exe is involved in Windows image management, so deleting these files could be part of a legitimate operation. But why so many files? Maybe during a system image deployment, temporary provider files are created and then deleted. \n\nWait, but the justification for being interesting would be if there's a pattern that's not typical. However, in this case, all the events are from the same process (Dism.exe) and the same directory. The fact that multiple files are being deleted might be normal during a system update. However, if these files were not supposed to be deleted, or if this is part of a larger attack, that could be a red flag. But based on the information given, there's no indication of malicious activity. The files are in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files. \n\nI think the key here is that the deletion is by Dism.exe, which is a trusted process. Unless there's an anomaly in the timing or other processes involved, this might be a legitimate activity. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's part of normal system operations. But I need to be sure. The confidence level would be around 0.6 because while it's not obviously malicious, the high number of deletions might warrant further investigation. However, since all the files are in the Temp folder and the process is legitimate, it's more likely benign.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that **Dism.exe** (a legitimate Windows system tool used for deployment and imaging) is deleting multiple `.dll` files from a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). The files are named after provider components (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`), which are commonly associated with Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (Windows Imaging) operations.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Process**: Dism.exe is a trusted system process, and the deletion of temporary provider files during system imaging or deployment is a known normal behavior.\n2. **Temporary Directory**: The files are located in the `%TEMP%` directory, which is typical for temporary files generated during system operations.\n3. **No Malicious Indicators**: There are no signs of unusual activity (e.g., unexpected processes, non-standard file paths, or lateral movement).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe activity is **likely benign** and part of a legitimate system operation (e.g., cleanup after a deployment or imaging task). While the volume of deletions might raise a flag in some contexts, the lack of malicious indicators and alignment with expected behavior of Dism.exe suggest this is not an attack.\n\n**Classification**: `NOT INTERESTING`  \n**Confidence**: `0.6` (moderate, as the activity is not obviously malicious but could warrant further context if part of a larger anomaly)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries that look like Windows event logs. The main thing here is that there's a PowerShell command creating a service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to a file in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\...\". The user probably wants to know if this is malicious or suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the events. The first few entries are normal processes like services.exe and svchost.exe, which are part of Windows. Then there's sppsvc.exe loading a DLL, which might be normal too. But then there's a bunch of entries with the same PowerShell command. \n\nThe command uses New-Service to create a new service with the name \"objeto_ativo\" and points to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". The fact that it's using PowerShell to create a service is a red flag. Usually, services are created through proper installation methods, not via PowerShell scripts. Also, the binary path is in a non-standard location like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\...\", which isn't typical for system services. \n\nI should check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service. Maybe it's part of some software, but the path doesn't ring a bell. The user might not know what this service is, so it's better to err on the side of caution. The repeated entries of the same command might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly to ensure the service is created or to trigger it.\n\nAnother thing is that the service is started immediately after creation. That's a common tactic in malware to execute code without user interaction. The use of \"unidade_logico\" in the path might be a misspelling or a custom directory, which is not standard. \n\nI should also consider the logs from the Windows Update Agent. Maybe the service is related to an update, but the path doesn't match typical update binaries. The \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks in the winlog might be part of the event logging system, but the PowerShell command is still suspicious.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the creation of a service via PowerShell, the non-standard binary path, and the immediate start of the service. These are indicators of potential malicious activity. The user should investigate further by checking the integrity of \"tarefa_logico.exe\", looking for any signs of tampering, and reviewing system logs for other anomalies.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a suspicious activity involving the creation of a new Windows service via PowerShell, which could be a potential security risk. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and recommendations:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Service Creation via PowerShell:**\n   - A PowerShell command is executed to create a new service named **`objeto_ativo`** with the binary path:  \n     `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - The service is immediately started using `Start-Service`.\n\n2. **Non-Standard File Path:**\n   - The binary path (`tarefa_logico.exe`) is located in a directory named **`unidade_logico`**, which is not a standard Windows system directory. This could indicate a custom or malicious payload.\n\n3. **Repetition of the Same Command:**\n   - The same PowerShell command is logged multiple times, suggesting either a failed attempt to execute the command or an attempt to ensure the service is created\/started.\n\n4. **Windows Event Context:**\n   - The logs are associated with **`Provider Lifecycle`** and **`Engine Lifecycle`** tasks, which are part of Windows event logging. However, the use of PowerShell to create services is not typical in these contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks:**\n- **Malware Installation:** The creation of a service via PowerShell is a common technique used by malware to persist on a system.\n- **Unusual File Location:** The presence of `tarefa_logico.exe` in a non-standard directory raises suspicion, as legitimate system services typically reside in `C:\\Windows\\System32` or other trusted locations.\n- **Lack of User Interaction:** The service is created and started automatically, which could indicate a covert installation without user consent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Executable:**\n   - Analyze **`tarefa_logico.exe`** using tools like **VirusTotal**, **Malwarebytes**, or **Windows Defender** to check for malware signatures.\n   - Verify the file's digital signature (if any) to confirm its legitimacy.\n\n2. **Check for Unauthorized Services:**\n   - Use the **Services Manager** (`services.msc`) to inspect the **`objeto_ativo`** service:\n     - Confirm if it is a legitimate service.\n     - Check the service's **Startup Type**, **Description**, and **Dependencies**.\n   - Use PowerShell to list all services:  \n     ```powershell\n     Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq \"Running\" }\n     ```\n\n3. **Review System Logs:**\n   - Look for additional logs related to the **`objeto_ativo`** service or the **`tarefa_logico.exe`** file in the **Windows Event Viewer** under:\n     - **Windows Logs > Security** (for account activity).\n     - **Application** or **System** logs (for errors or warnings).\n\n4. **Network Monitoring:**\n   - Monitor network traffic from **`tarefa_logico.exe`** to detect any suspicious communication (e.g., with external servers).\n\n5. **System Integrity Check:**\n   - Run a full system scan with an updated antivirus tool.\n   - Use **Windows Defender Offline** to detect rootkits or hidden malware.\n\n6. **User Education:**\n   - Ensure users are aware of the risks of executing PowerShell scripts from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe creation of the **`objeto_ativo`** service via PowerShell with a non-standard binary path is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation. While the activity could be legitimate (e.g., a custom application), the lack of transparency and the use of PowerShell for service creation are red flags. Immediate action to analyze the file and verify the service's legitimacy is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one stands out because it's using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to an executable in a non-standard directory: C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That seems suspicious because creating a service with a custom executable, especially from a directory that's not typical for system services, could be a sign of malware trying to persist on the system.\n\nThe rest of the events are PowerShell commands with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which is the default policy. The commands are either writing a result of 1 or checking INF files for certain patterns. The repeated commands might be part of a script that's scanning for specific driver installation sections in INF files. However, the fact that they're using Restricted policy might be a red flag because normally, if you're running scripts that need to do something, you might bypass the restricted policy, but here they're not. But the first event is the main concern here.\n\nThe other events don't show any obvious malicious activity, but the first one is a clear indicator of potential compromise. The creation of a new service with a non-standard executable path is a common tactic used by malware to maintain persistence. Even though the other events are benign, the presence of that first event makes the whole batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is around 0.8 because while there's a clear suspicious event, we can't be 100% certain without more context, like checking if the executable is legitimate or if there are other related events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating and starting a new service with a suspicious binary path in a non-standard directory (C:\\\\unidade_logico...), which is a common malware persistence technique.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first two events are identical. The process command line is a PowerShell script that checks for specific patterns in INF files. The command is looking for sections named [defaultinstall.nt...] which are typically part of Windows installation INF files. The script sets a result based on whether it finds those sections. The task here is 'Engine Lifecycle'. \n\nNow, the third event has a winlog task 'Security Group Management' but no process or file info. The fourth is 'services.exe' under 'Logon' task, and the fifth is 'Special Logon' with no process details.\n\nHmm. The first two events are the same PowerShell command. The script is scanning INF files in the Windows directory for specific sections. INF files are used for installing drivers and other system components. The presence of [defaultinstall.nt...] sections might indicate something related to driver installation or system configuration. But why would someone run this script? Maybe checking for certain driver installations, but is that suspicious?\n\nThe task 'Engine Lifecycle' is a bit vague. I'm not sure what that refers to exactly. However, the repetition of the same PowerShell command in two events might be a red flag. If it's a legitimate process, it might not be repeated twice, but maybe it's part of a normal system check. However, the script's purpose isn't immediately clear. It's searching for INF files with specific sections, which could be part of a malicious activity if trying to detect or manipulate system installations.\n\nThe other events don't seem suspicious. 'Security Group Management' and 'Logon' tasks are common. 'services.exe' is a legitimate system process. The 'Special Logon' task might relate to user logon events, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the main point here is the PowerShell script. The command is looking for INF files with specific sections. If this is part of a normal system check, maybe it's not suspicious. However, the fact that the same command is logged twice might indicate an attempt to run this script multiple times, possibly as part of a larger malicious activity. Alternatively, it could be a benign check that's being logged multiple times by the system.\n\nWait, but the justification for classification is based on the entire batch. The script's command line is the same in two events. The task 'Engine Lifecycle' might not be a standard task name, which could be suspicious. But I need to check if that's a known task. If not, that might be a sign of something unusual.\n\nAlso, the PowerShell script is using 'Get-Content' on INF files, which are usually system files. If an attacker is trying to check for certain INF sections, maybe they're looking for vulnerabilities or trying to install malicious drivers. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The script itself isn't obviously malicious, but the repetition and the task name could be indicators.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch is interesting because the same PowerShell command is executed twice, which is unusual. The script's purpose isn't clear, and the task name 'Engine Lifecycle' isn't standard. However, the confidence might be medium, as there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent, but the repetition and the nature of the script warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The same PowerShell command is executed twice, scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections (ntamd64, ntarm, etc.), which may indicate probing for system configuration details or potential exploitation vectors.
