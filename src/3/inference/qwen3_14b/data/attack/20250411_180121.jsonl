So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see powershell.exe activities. \n\nLooking at the powershell events, there's a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient. The command line is obfuscated with escaped quotes and variables, which is a common technique used by attackers to hide malicious activity. The files are being downloaded to the TEMP directory, which is a red flag because temporary directories are often used for executing malicious scripts.\n\nThen, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various .dll files. Some of these are legitimate .NET assemblies, but the presence of multiple image loads, especially from different paths, might indicate something is wrong. Also, there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then immediately deleting a file could be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces, which is suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub. While GitHub is a legitimate source, the fact that multiple different repositories are being accessed, and the filenames are similar (LICENSE.txt), might be part of a larger malicious payload. The use of \"modulo_padrao.txt\" and other similar names could be part of a naming pattern to avoid detection.\n\nThe combination of these events—downloading files, executing scripts, loading multiple DLLs, and file creation\/deletion—suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some components are legitimate, the overall pattern is indicative of a possible attack, such as downloading and executing a script that could be part of a larger exploit or data exfiltration.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these might be false positives. For example, legitimate scripts might use similar techniques. But given the number of events and the suspicious patterns, it's more likely to be a security incident. The confidence is high because the indicators align with common attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute obfuscated commands to download files from GitHub repositories, followed by file creation\/deletion in temporary directories.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe executing commands that download files from GitHub URLs. The command lines use WebClient's DownloadFile method, which is a common technique for downloading files. The URLs all point to LICENSE.txt files from different repositories. While downloading a LICENSE file isn't inherently malicious, the fact that it's happening multiple times with different repositories might be suspicious. Usually, a LICENSE file is part of a project's documentation, but if an attacker is using it to deliver malware, that's a problem.\n\nNow, checking the file events. There's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt, and another at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. The first one is a regular download, but the second path is related to PowerShell's startup profile, which could be a red flag if it's being modified without user knowledge. However, the event just says \"File created\" without indicating any malicious content yet.\n\nThen there are multiple registry events related to chrome.exe. Chrome setting registry values repeatedly might be normal if it's updating settings, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like persistence mechanisms, that's concerning. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The same goes for the conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe events. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a .yml.new file might be part of its normal operation.\n\nThe DNS query event is just a query, which is normal. The Image loaded event for MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's expected.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, some file creations, and registry changes. The repeated PowerShell downloads could be indicative of someone trying to execute scripts or download payloads. However, since all the files are named LICENSE.txt, which are typically benign, it's possible that this is just legitimate activity. But the high number of such events and the different repositories might suggest that someone is testing or trying to exfiltrate data. However, without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files or more suspicious activities like execution of the downloaded files, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe confidence here is moderate. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.65.

That's common, maybe a normal user activity. But then there's an entry about MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe just monitoring.\n\nThen winlogbeat.exe is creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably legitimate. But wait, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. That's a red flag. PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task might be normal, but the name \"spawn\" is suspicious. Also, the command is using SCHTASKS with \/F, which forces deletion. Maybe someone is trying to remove evidence.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe being executed, which is part of the task scheduler. But the command line shows deleting a task named \"spawn\". That's a bit odd.

Conhost is a normal Windows process, but powershell being involved in registry changes might be a red flag. Then there's whoami.exe, which is usually used to check user context, but if it's part of a larger attack, that could be bad.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing the registry, especially under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That key is often used for startup programs. If an attacker is modifying this, they might be trying to persist after reboot. The command line for one of the cmd.exe processes is deleting a registry value, which could be removing evidence or trying to clean up.\n\nThen there's reg.exe being used to delete a registry entry. That's a legitimate tool, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a malicious action. The repeated use of powershell.exe with \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might be normal, but the multiple entries could indicate something automated or a script running.\n\nAlso, the last entry mentions mscoree.dll being loaded. That's part of the .NET runtime, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, it might be a sign of something malicious.

There's also a temporary file created and then deleted, which might be normal script activity. However, there's a pattern here: multiple ImageLoad events for .NET assemblies. That could be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell to load malicious DLLs. \n\nWait, but the files listed here are all legitimate system files. For example, mscoreei.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET framework. The MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are from Windows Defender. So maybe this is just PowerShell running normally, perhaps executing scripts that are part of legitimate processes. \n\nHowever, there are also events like File created and then immediately deleted, which could be a sign of something trying to execute a script temporarily. The temporary file path is in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is common for such activities. But since it's deleted right after, maybe it's just a script test or policy check.

But repeated entries might be worth noting.\n\nAn interesting point is the image loaded by powershell.exe pointing to MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not malicious. However, another image load event points to mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET runtime. That's normal, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThere's a command line that tries to remove a file named 'objeto_principal.zip' from the temp directory. Removing a zip file could be part of cleanup, but if the file was downloaded earlier, it might be part of an attack. However, the event only shows the removal, not the download. So that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nMultiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe might indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed by other processes, which could be normal or suspicious. Also, the fact that there are so many registry modifications by both chrome.exe and powershell.exe might indicate some kind of configuration changes or attempts to persist.\n\nBut wait, chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times is unusual. Maybe a browser hijack or some form of malware trying to alter settings. However, without seeing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell.

For example, __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1 is created and then deleted. \n\nThen there are a bunch of Remove-Item commands in the command_line field, all targeting different .zip files in the TEMP directory. Each of these commands is part of a PowerShell script that's trying to remove specific zip files, with ErrorAction Ignore to prevent errors if the files don't exist.

Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably normal.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell commands again. The fact that they're removing specific files like 'registro_auxiliar.txt', 'registro_comum.txt', etc., might indicate that these files are part of some process. If they're being deleted, maybe they were used for some activity. But why delete them? Maybe to hide evidence.\n\nThe use of $env:TEMP is a common place for temporary files, but the combination of multiple deletions and the presence of other events like file creation and registry changes might be part of a larger activity. However, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The events don't show any network activity, privilege escalation, or unusual process executions beyond what might be normal.\n\nWait, but the same PowerShell command is repeated a couple of times. The first entry has 'registro_auxiliar.txt', then 'registro_comum.txt', 'estrutura_padrao.txt', and 'pacote_ativo.txt'.

But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nConsidering all this, the main suspicious points are the repeated PowerShell deletions in TEMP and the multiple registry changes.

My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. Most of them are about processes being accessed or created. There's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'whoami.exe' entries. The 'whoami.exe' is a legitimate command that shows user information, but when it's run multiple times, especially alongside PowerShell, that might be suspicious. \n\nWait, the 'whoami.exe' is being executed multiple times here. Let me count. There are entries for 'Process Create' for whoami.exe repeated several times. That's a few instances. But why would someone run whoami so many times? It's possible that it's part of a normal process, but combined with PowerShell activity, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, they're all 'Process accessed' with no file mentioned. But then there's one entry where PowerShell created a file called 'pacote_ativo.txt'. That's in the user's Downloads folder. Creating a file in the Downloads directory isn't necessarily bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe it's something. However, the file name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring or just a normal file name.\n\nThen there's an event involving 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring logs, so that's probably normal. But the file path seems to be part of a setup or configuration file. The .yml.new extension might indicate that it's a new configuration file being created, which could be part of a setup process. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, the key thing here is the repetition of 'whoami.exe' and PowerShell events. If an attacker is trying to escalate privileges or gather information, they might use whoami to check the current user context. However, multiple executions of whoami in quick succession might be a sign of something. But on its own, that's not conclusive.\n\nAnother point is the combination of PowerShell and whoami. PowerShell is a common tool for attackers, but so is whoami. However, the fact that whoami is being created as a process multiple times might be indicative of something. But again, it's possible that this is just a normal user activity.\n\nLooking at the confidence level, I need to decide if this is enough to flag as interesting. The presence of multiple ProcessCreate events for whoami and ProcessAccess for PowerShell might be worth investigating, but without more suspicious activities (like network connections, file modifications, or other unusual processes), it's on the borderline. The file creation by PowerShell is a single event, so maybe not enough. The winlogbeat file is legitimate.\n\nHmm. The justification would need to be concise. Maybe the combination of repeated whoami and PowerShell access events could be a sign of reconnaissance or privilege escalation. But without more data, it's not certain. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. Because while the events aren't clearly malicious, the repetition and the use of whoami might be worth looking into further.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple 'whoami.exe' process creations and repeated 'powershell.exe' process access events suggest potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.
