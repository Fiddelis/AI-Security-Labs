{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several Process Create events, which is normal, but there's also a lot of Process Access and Registry value set events. Hmm, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there are multiple instances of Compress-Archive commands. The paths mentioned are a bit generic, like \"C:\\modulo_temporario\\objeto_principal\\unidade_secundario\\bin\\entrada_logico\" and similar. These paths don't immediately look like standard system directories, but they could be part of a legitimate application. However, the repetition of Compress-Archive might be a red flag. Why would someone need to compress so many different directories into temporary files? It could be part of a data exfiltration attempt, where the attacker is trying to compress sensitive data before sending it out.\n\nThen there's the File created and then immediately deleted event. The file is created in the Temp directory and then deleted. That's a common technique used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1. The presence of \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" might be a red herring, but the fact that it's created and deleted quickly is suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are several Image Load events for .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate .NET components, so that's probably normal. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded might be relevant. If this is a legitimate process, Defender would have detected it, but maybe there's something else going on here.\n\nAnother thing to note is the Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there are a lot of them or they're being used in unexpected ways, that could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell instances running Compress-Archive on various paths, temporary files created and deleted, and some image loads. While some of these could be legitimate, the pattern of creating and deleting files, along with the repeated use of Compress-Archive, might indicate an attempt to move data out of the system. The use of PowerShell for these tasks is common in both legitimate and malicious contexts, but the combination of these events could warrant further investigation. I should flag this as interesting because there are indicators that might point to data exfiltration or other malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, though they are not definitively malicious on their own. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Repetitive Use of `Compress-Archive` in PowerShell**:\n   - **Pattern**: Multiple entries show PowerShell executing `Compress-Archive` commands with paths like `C:\\modulo_temporario\\objeto_principal\\...` and destinations in `$env:TEMP\\...`. These paths are obfuscated (e.g., \"modulo_temporario,\" \"objeto_principal\") and lack clear context, which could indicate evasion or obfuscation.\n   - **Implication**: Compressing files into temporary directories may be part of **data exfiltration** (e.g., preparing files for transfer) or **malware persistence** (e.g., packing payloads).\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**:\n   - **Event**: A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1`) is created in `$env:TEMP` and then deleted. The filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might mimic legitimate PowerShell scripts.\n   - **Implication**: This behavior is common in **malware** to avoid leaving forensic traces. The file's deletion suggests the process may be **self-erasing** or evading detection.\n\n3. **High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**:\n   - **Events**: Over 20 entries involve PowerShell, including `Process Create`, `Process Access`, `Pipe Created`, and `Provider Lifecycle` events. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, excessive use (especially with obfuscated commands) raises concerns about **script-based attacks** (e.g., PowerShell Empire, Cobalt Strike).\n\n4. **Unusual DLL Loads**:\n   - **Events**: Loading of `.NET` DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) is normal, but the presence of **Windows Defender's `MpOAV.dll`** (a component for real-time protection) being loaded in a non-standard context could indicate **tampering** or **bypassing security mechanisms**.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Legitimate Scenarios**:\n  - Automated scripts compressing logs or temporary files.\n  - Legitimate use of PowerShell for system administration.\n  - Temporary file creation\/deletion during software installation or updates.\n\n- **Malicious Scenarios**:\n  - **Data Exfiltration**: Compressing sensitive data into temporary files for transfer (e.g., via HTTP, FTP, or encrypted channels).\n  - **Malware Execution**: Using PowerShell to execute obfuscated scripts (e.g., via `Invoke-Expression` or `IEX`).\n  - **Persistence**: Storing malicious payloads in compressed files to avoid detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Further Investigation**\n1. **Correlate with Network Traffic**:\n   - Check if the compressed files (`*.zip`) are being transmitted to external IPs or domains. Look for unusual outbound connections to unknown servers.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Extract and deobfuscate the `Compress-Archive` commands to determine if they are part of a larger malicious payload (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Start-Process` hidden within the script).\n\n3. **Check File Contents**:\n   - Recover the deleted temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) from disk or memory to analyze its contents. If it contains malicious code, this would confirm an attack.\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate if the PowerShell activity is part of a larger attack chain (e.g., privilege escalation, credential dumping, or lateral movement via SMB or RDP).\n\n5. **Check Windows Defender Logs**:\n   - Review Defender's real-time protection logs for alerts related to `MpOAV.dll` or other suspicious activity. Confirm if the system is being actively monitored or if the logs have been tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events are **highly suspicious** and suggest potential **malicious activity**, particularly **data exfiltration** or **script-based attacks**. While not conclusive, the combination of repetitive PowerShell usage, temporary file creation\/deletion, and obfuscated paths warrants immediate investigation. Further analysis of network traffic, file contents, and system logs is critical to determine if this is a true security incident."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's an event where powershell.exe is involved with the ImageLoad task, loading a DLL from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate processes. But I should note that.\n\nThen, there are several entries where powershell.exe is used with Compress-Archive commands. The paths mentioned like C:\\elemento_secundario\\tarefa_padrao... look suspicious. They have a lot of Portuguese words mixed with technical terms. Also, the destination paths are in the TEMP directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The fact that they're compressing files into ZIPs in TEMP might be a red flag. But are these legitimate? Maybe the user is just compressing files, but the repeated use of Compress-Archive with different paths could indicate automated or malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But if it's a new file, maybe it's part of an installation or setup. Not sure yet.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events involving powershell.exe, conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, etc. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're from unexpected processes, that's suspicious. However, the logs don't show the specific registry keys being modified, so it's hard to tell.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll are normal. Those are standard Windows components.\n\nLooking again at the Compress-Archive commands. The paths have a pattern with \"tarefa\" (which means task in Portuguese) and \"registro\" (record). Maybe the user is working on a project with those names, but the repetition and the use of TEMP directories could be indicative of something else. Also, the fact that multiple different source paths are being compressed into TEMP might be a sign of data exfiltration or preparation for further actions.\n\nBut there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The logs don't show network connections, suspicious files, or unauthorized access. However, the combination of multiple Compress-Archive commands from powershell.exe in TEMP directories, along with the odd file names, might warrant further investigation. It's possible that these are just normal operations, but the unusual patterns could be a sign of something more. I should flag this as potentially interesting but not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries exhibit a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Compression Activity:**\n   - **Recurring `Compress-Archive` Commands:** Multiple entries show PowerShell compressing files from paths like `C:\\elemento_secundario\\tarefa_padrao...` into temporary directories (e.g., `%TEMP%`). \n     - **Suspicious Indicators:**\n       - **Non-Standard Paths:** The use of Portuguese terms (e.g., `tarefa`, `registro`) in folder names is unusual for system processes and could indicate obfuscation or a non-English user context.\n       - **TEMP Directory Usage:** Compressing files to `%TEMP%` is common in malware for transient operations, though not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Legitimate System Activity:**\n   - **ImageLoad Events:** Entries for `urlmon.dll` (a legitimate Windows component) and `svchost.exe` are normal.\n   - **Winlogbeat File Creation:** The creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is consistent with log shipper configuration updates.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Frequent `Registry value set` Events:** While registry changes are common, the involvement of processes like `notepad.exe` and `calc.exe` (typically not modifying registry keys) raises mild suspicion but lacks context for definitive judgment.\n\n4. **No Immediate Malicious Evidence:**\n   - No network activity, suspicious file hashes, or direct malware indicators (e.g., `calc.exe` is a legitimate calculator).\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The repeated use of `Compress-Archive` with non-standard paths and TEMP directory targeting warrants closer inspection. However, without additional context (e.g., network traffic, file contents), these activities could also be part of legitimate workflows (e.g., automated backups or scripts).\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Further Investigation:** \n  - Analyze the contents of the compressed files in `%TEMP%` to determine their purpose.\n  - Check for associated network activity (e.g., data exfiltration).\n  - Monitor the user context (e.g., whether the account has elevated privileges or unusual access rights).\n- **Contextual Correlation:** Cross-reference these logs with other security tools (e.g., endpoint detection, network logs) to identify anomalies.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **potentially interesting** due to the unusual compression patterns and non-standard paths. While not definitively malicious, they merit further scrutiny to rule out benign or malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them are about chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of entries. But wait, registry changes can be normal, but if it's happening a lot, maybe that's suspicious. However, chrome.exe might legitimately modify the registry for its own purposes, like settings or extensions. But then, there are a couple of other events.\n\nOne event mentions an image loaded from amsi.dll. Amsi is part of Windows Defender, so that's a legitimate file. Another one loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender's directory. Those seem okay. But then there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's unexpected. However, if the user is installing or configuring winlogbeat, that's normal.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed twice, which isn't necessarily bad. And whoami.exe running, which just displays user info. That's usually harmless unless part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry changes by chrome.exe could be normal, but maybe too frequent? However, without more context, like unusual registry keys or other malicious activities, it's hard to say. The other events don't show obvious malicious activity. The files accessed are legitimate. The presence of winlogbeat might be part of a monitoring setup. \n\nHmm, but maybe the repetition of the same events (chrome.exe registry changes) is noteworthy. However, without knowing the baseline, it's hard to tell. Since there's no clear indicator of compromise here—like unexpected processes, network activity, or access to suspicious files—the batch might not be interesting. The events don't show a clear attack pattern. So, I'd lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, as there's no strong evidence of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate Chrome.exe registry modifications and standard system process activities (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). No clear indicators of compromise, suspicious file paths, or anomalous behavior are present across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
