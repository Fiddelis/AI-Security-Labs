{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Multiple registry changes might be normal, but if it's a lot, it could indicate something. However, chrome.exe doing that might be part of its normal operations, like updating settings. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process, which is a legitimate command to get user info. That's probably just a standard check. Then, another powershell.exe process with a command line that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, that script name sounds like it could be malicious. Keystrokes usually relate to keylogging, which is a red flag. The script is being executed with a log path in the TEMP directory, which is common for malware to store data temporarily.\n\nAlso, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe loads various .dll files from system directories. While some of these are legitimate .NET assemblies, the repeated image loads might be part of the script's execution. However, the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is concerning. Even if the script is named generically, the action of capturing keystrokes is malicious.\n\nThen, there are several entries with the same command line pattern, varying the path to Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing paths. The use of different directories each time could be a tactic to avoid signature-based detection.\n\nPutting this together: the key points are the execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 multiple times from different paths, which is likely a keylogger. Even though some events are normal (like chrome.exe registry changes), the presence of the keylogging script and the repeated attempts to execute it from various locations are strong indicators of malicious activity. The classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence because the keylogger is a clear sign of a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from various paths, indicating potential keylogging activity.

First, I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several entries with powershell.exe. The command lines mention executing scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is often associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information. The fact that the same script is being run multiple times from different paths might indicate an attempt to persist or evade detection.\n\nAlso, there's a log entry where the process is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path points to another Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That could mean a remote command is being executed, which is suspicious. \n\nOther entries involve normal activities like file creation and image loading, such as Windows Defender DLLs. Those might be legitimate, but combined with the PowerShell scripts, it's concerning. The repeated creation and deletion of temporary files might be part of a larger attack, like downloading and executing malicious code.\n\nHowever, there are also entries from winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe, which could be normal system processes. But the presence of multiple keystroke logging scripts and remote command execution suggests a higher risk. \n\nI should consider if these events together form a pattern of malicious behavior. The confidence here is medium because while some events are suspicious, others are benign. But the combination of PowerShell scripts for keystroke logging and remote command execution is enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in TEMP directories, suggesting potential keystroke logging.
