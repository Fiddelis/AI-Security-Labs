{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, there are several process creations and registry modifications. The processes involved include powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe. The winlogbeat.exe is also creating files. Now, some of these might be normal, but others could be suspicious.\n\nFirst, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The events mention 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set', which could be part of normal operations, but when combined with other actions, might indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there's the registry modification. The command line for cmd.exe includes adding a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's a classic technique to create a persistence mechanism, so that the malware runs every time the user logs in. The entries are named \"registro_auxiliar\" and \"entrada_principal\", pointing to executables like estrutura_principal.exe and pacote_temporario.exe. These files are in a path that seems arbitrary, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the creation of a file called modulo_padrao.txt by powershell.exe. Not sure what that's for, but combined with the registry changes, it might be part of an attack. However, there's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which could be part of a legitimate log collection process, but maybe that's being exploited here.\n\nWait, but are there any signs of actual malicious activity beyond just the registry changes and file creation? The whoami.exe is a standard command to check user context, which might be part of reconnaissance. The multiple process accesses might be normal, but the combination of registry persistence and file creation in user directories could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish a foothold.\n\nHowever, the confidence here isn't 100% because some of these events could be part of a legitimate setup. But the presence of multiple registry modifications under Run keys, along with the use of PowerShell and CMD for these actions, is suspicious. The fact that the same file (.yml.new) is created twice by winlogbeat might be a red herring, but the other registry entries are more concerning.\n\nSo, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The justification would be the suspicious registry modifications for persistence and the use of PowerShell\/CMD to perform these actions, which are common in attacks. The confidence is around 0.75 because while there are indicators of compromise, without more context (like network activity, unexpected binaries, etc.), it's not definitive but still noteworthy.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: repeated registry modifications under HKCU\\\\Run keys (common persistence technique), PowerShell\/cmd.exe used for registry edits, and creation of potential malicious executables (estrutura_principal.exe, pacote_temporario.exe) in user directories. These patterns align with attack behavior for persistence and execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
