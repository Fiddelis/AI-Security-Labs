{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. First, I need to check if there's any suspicious activity here. The user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate event.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' activities. The first event shows 'powershell.exe' with a registry value set. Then there's a 'cmd.exe' command that adds a user and adds them to the administrators group. That's a red flag because creating new users and adding them to admin groups can be part of privilege escalation or unauthorized access.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' being used to add users and modify groups. The command lines show adding users like \"modulo_principal_Admin\" with temporary passwords and adding them to administrators. The use of 'net1.exe' is suspicious because it's not a standard Windows utility; the correct one is 'net.exe'. This might indicate a malicious binary being used to bypass security measures.\n\nThen there's 'svchost.exe' and 'OneDrive.exe' loading 'BitsProxy.dll'. While 'svchost' is a normal process, loading certain DLLs can be part of malware activities. However, 'OneDrive.exe' is a legitimate application, so this might not be harmful, but it's worth checking.\n\nThere are also multiple 'Registry value set' events, which could be normal, but combined with the user and group modifications, it might suggest configuration changes by an attacker. The presence of 'HxTsr.exe' is another point of concern because it's not a standard Windows process and could be malware.\n\nThe 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the user's Downloads directory is probably part of log collection, but if it's unexpected, it might be a sign of something else. However, the main issues here are the user account management events and the use of non-standard executables like 'net1.exe' and 'HxTsr.exe'.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple attempts to modify user accounts and groups, which is a common attack vector. The use of suspicious processes and commands indicates potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: user account creation (net user \/add), administrative group membership modification (net localgroup administrators), use of non-standard executables (net1.exe, HxTsr.exe), and registry modifications. These patterns are commonly associated with privilege escalation and lateral movement in attack chains.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to chrome.exe. There's a pipe created event, and then multiple registry value set events. Then there's Calculator.exe doing a registry value set. But most of the events are from chrome.exe. \n\nWait, the registry events might be normal if chrome is updating its settings, but maybe not. However, there's also an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender files. Loading those might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unusual way, that could be a red flag. \n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that might be part of normal operations. Another file created by powershell.exe, but the file name is \"componente_secundario.txt\" which seems like a regular text file. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nBut looking at the frequency, there are a lot of registry value set events from chrome.exe. That's a lot. Maybe that's just chrome doing a lot of registry changes, but maybe it's being used for something malicious. However, the image loaded events are for legitimate system files. \n\nHmm, but the presence of multiple registry changes could indicate some kind of configuration change or maybe even a persistence mechanism. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The file events don't show any suspicious paths except maybe the winlogbeat file, but that's a known tool. \n\nWait, but the user said to analyze the entire batch as a whole. The majority of events are from chrome.exe, which is a common target for attacks. The registry events might be part of normal operation, but combined with image loads of defender DLLs, maybe that's just chrome interacting with system components. \n\nHowever, the high number of registry events might be unusual. But I need to check if there's any other signs. The other events are from winlogbeat and powershell, which are not necessarily malicious. \n\nI think the key here is that there's a lot of registry activity from chrome.exe, but without more indicators like unexpected processes, network activity, or unusual file modifications, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting. However, the high volume of registry changes might warrant further investigation. \n\nSo, maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because of the high number of registry events from chrome, but not enough to be certain. The justification would be the repeated registry modifications and image loads of system files, which could indicate benign activity or potential malicious behavior requiring further analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events from chrome.exe combined with image loading of Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) suggest potential benign system interaction or possible evasion techniques. The high frequency of registry events may indicate unusual behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
