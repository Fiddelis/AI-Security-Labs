{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the malicious activity:\n\n1. **Initial Infection**\n   - A `services.exe` process sets a registry value (`RegistryEvent`), which is often associated with malware dropping or installing itself.\n\n2. **Malware Execution**\n   - A `sppsvc.exe` process loads a task scheduler DLL (`taskschd.dll`), suggesting that the malware might be scheduled to run at certain times.\n   - A `svchost.exe` process sets a registry value, further indicating possible malicious activity.\n\n3. **Command Line Activity**\n   - A `powershell.exe` process accesses another process multiple times (`ProcessAccess`), which could indicate communication with other malware components or C&C server.\n   - The `whoami.exe` command is run from `powershell.exe`, suggesting an attempt to gather system information.\n   - The malware then deletes a script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) from the temp folder, possibly to hide its tracks.\n\n4. **File Deletion**\n   - The `powershell.exe` process attempts to delete files in the temp folder (`\"Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip\"`), which could indicate an attempt to remove any traces of the initial infection or download.\n\n5. **DLL Loading**\n   - The `powershell.exe` process loads several DLLs (`.dll`), including Microsoft.NET-related DLLs and `MpOAV.dll`, which is part of Windows Defender. This behavior might be related to evasion techniques used by malware, such as hiding itself from AV software.\n\nBased on these logs, it appears that the system has been infected with a sophisticated piece of malware (possibly a Trojan or worm) that uses PowerShell for its malicious activities and attempts to hide its presence through file deletion. It's recommended to perform a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus\/anti-malware software and consider restoring from a clean backup if the system is found infected."}
