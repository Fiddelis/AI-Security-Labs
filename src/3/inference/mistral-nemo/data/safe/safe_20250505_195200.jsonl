You can do this by going to `File > Options > Add-ins` (in Word) or `File > Options > Add-Ins` (in other Office applications), then selecting `COM Add-ins` from the dropdown, and clicking `Go...`. Uncheck any non-Microsoft add-ins.\n   - **Reset Office**: You can reset Office to its default settings by going to `Control Panel > Programs > Microsoft Office Tools`, right-clicking on your Office application (e.g., Word), and selecting `Change`. Then, choose `Repair` and follow the prompts. After that, restart your computer.\n\n4. **Contact Microsoft Support**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to reach out to Microsoft Support for further assistance.
