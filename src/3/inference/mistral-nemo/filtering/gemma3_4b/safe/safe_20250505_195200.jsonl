It could be malware, a software bug, or unintended software functionality.\n2. **Isolate Affected Files:** Quarantine the created JavaScript files for further analysis to check if they contain malicious payloads.\n3. **Monitor Process Behavior:** Closely monitor the 'SDXHelper.exe' process and its associated activities to identify any patterns or anomalies that could indicate a threat.\n4. **User Education:** If the cause is found to be user-related (e.g., clicking on malicious links), educate the user about potential threats and how to avoid them in the future.\n\n**Mitigation Steps:**\n1. Temporarily disable 'SDXHelper.exe' process if its continuous activity is causing disruptions or suspected as malicious.\n2. Regularly update your antivirus software and Windows Defender to protect against known threats.\n3. Keep Microsoft Office suite up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\n**Next Steps:**await further investigation into the cause of these repeated file creations, and take appropriate actions based on the findings."}

There were a total of 12 files created, with 6 word-copilot.min.js files and 6 officeaicopilot-strings.min.js files each."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"**Analysis:**\n\nAll the events recorded are file creations by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files created are JavaScript files (with .js extension) related to Office's AI copilot features. These files are stored in the OfflineFiles folder under PackageResources, which is located within the local app data for Microsoft Office.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThe repeated file creation events by SDXHelper.exe could be due to:\n\n1. **Office Update:** Microsoft Office frequently updates its components and features like AI copilot to provide new functionalities or improvements. These updates might involve creating or updating these JavaScript files.\n\n2. **Caching:** The OfflineFiles folder suggests that these files might be cached versions of the online resources for faster access when the user is offline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the process name, file types, and locations, it's reasonable to conclude that these events are related to Microsoft Office's AI copilot feature updates or caching mechanisms. No malicious activity is suspected based on the provided information alone. However, if these events cause significant performance issues or appear unusually frequent, further investigation might be warranted.\n\n**JUSTIFICATION SCORE:** 95% (assuming no prior knowledge of similar behavior from this process)"}
