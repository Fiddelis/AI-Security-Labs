This could indicate a potential infection or unwanted service creation.\n\n2. **PowerShell Activities:**\n   - There are multiple repeated entries with the same PowerShell commands:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"\\nStart-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - These commands create a new service named `objeto_ativo` with the binary path pointing to an executable in `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin`. They then start this service.\n   - After these repeated entries, there's another PowerShell command:\n     ```\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'\n     ```\n   - This command might indicate the successful completion of the previous task.\n\n3. **Windows Update Agent:**\n   - There's an entry for \"Windows Update Agent,\" which could be normal behavior but worth noting in case it's related to the suspicious activities.\n\n4. **Services Created:**\n   - A service named `objeto_ativo` was created, and its binary path points to a potentially malicious executable (`tarefa_logico.exe`).\n\nBased on these logs, it appears that someone or something is creating and starting a new service with a potentially malicious executable as the binary path. The repeated PowerShell commands suggest an automated or scripted attack. You should investigate the `tarefa_logico.exe` file further and consider removing the suspicious service (`objeto_ativo`)."}
