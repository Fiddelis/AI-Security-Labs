Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **File Creation Events (Rule: FileCreate):**\n  - Process name: `SDXHelper.exe`\n  - Files created: JavaScript files (`*.js`) with names following the pattern `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.\n  - Occurrences: 15 times (with different hashes)\n\n- **Registry Value Set Event (Rule: RegistryEvent):**\n  - Process name: `chrome.exe`\n  - No file specified (`null`)\n\n**Possible Actions\/Suspicious Activities:**\n\n1. The frequent creation of JavaScript files by `SDXHelper.exe`, a process likely associated with Microsoft Office, might indicate an update or installation related to the Office suite, possibly involving the 'Office Add-in for AI' feature.\n\n2. The single registry value set event by `chrome.exe` could be due to Google Chrome updating its settings or preferences.\n\n**Further Investigation Needed:**\n\n- Check if any other unusual activities are occurring around these events.\n- Verify with the user if they recently updated or installed any new software, especially related to Microsoft Office.\n- Monitor for any unusual behavior or performance issues on the machine."}

Monitor the system for any unusual behavior or performance degradation.\n2. Check if there are any recent updates or changes related to 'OfficeAICopilot' that might be causing these events.\n3. Investigate whether other users on the same network or system are experiencing similar issues.\n4. If appropriate, consider disabling or removing the Office Add-in temporarily until the issue can be resolved.\n5. Contact Microsoft support or the software vendor for further assistance if the issue persists.\n\n**Classification:**\n- **Type:** Software-related event\n- **Severity:** Low to Medium (depending on the impact on system performance and user experience)\n- **Certainty:** High"}
