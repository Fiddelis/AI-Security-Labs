These files could be part of an ongoing update or installation process.\n2. **Copilot String Resources:** Given the filenames and their content, these JavaScript files seem to contain string resources for Excel copilot features. This might imply that some new strings are being added or updated as part of a feature rollout.\n3. **No apparent threat (initial assessment):** Based on the standard nature of the process and the typical location of these files, there's no immediate indication of malware or unusual behavior. However, always ensure to monitor such activities for any potential security risks.\n\nHere's an example of how you might represent this data in a more readable format:\n\n| Event ID | Process Name       | Task              | File Path                                                           |\n|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1         | SDXHelper.exe      | File Created     | C:\\Users\\Fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\... |\n| ...       | ...                 | ...               | ...                                                        |\n| 21        | SDXHelper.exe      | File Created     | C:\\Users\\Fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\... |\n\nAgain, always monitor such activities to ensure they align with expected behaviors and don't pose any security risks."}

The filenames are all variations of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\".\n\n**JUSTIFICATION:**\n\nBased on the file names, which all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" and end with \".js\", it can be inferred that these files might be related to some JavaScript resources for Microsoft Office. The repetitive pattern of \"<hash>.js\" suggests that these could be minified or compressed JavaScript files, where the hash is likely a checksum or versioning identifier.\n\nThe process \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating these files indicates that this helper process is responsible for generating or managing these JavaScript resources. However, without more context or logs, it's challenging to determine if this activity is normal or anomalous.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\n\nTo further investigate, consider the following steps:\n1. Check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate Microsoft Office process.\n2. Verify with the user (fiddelis) if they recently installed any updates or new software that might be related to these file creations.\n3. Monitor the activity of \"SDXHelper.exe\" and its associated files to observe if there are any unusual behaviors like rapid growth in file count, sudden increase in CPU usage, or unexpected network traffic.\n4.
