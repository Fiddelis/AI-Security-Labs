{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, here's a timeline of events and potential indicators of malicious activity:\n\n1. **Initial Execution**\n   - `sppsvc.exe` loads `taskschd.dll`. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate scheduled tasks.\n   - `svchost.exe` sets a registry value.\n\n2. **Evasion and Privilege Escalation**\n   - `powershell.exe` is accessed repeatedly, which is not unusual but warrants attention due to the following activities.\n   - `whoami.exe` is executed. This could be an attempt to gather information about the current user's privileges.\n   - `powershell.exe` removes all files in the Temp directory (`$env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip`). This could indicate an attempt to delete evidence of the initial infection vector (if `entrada_principal.zip` was used).\n\n3. **.NET Framework Loading**\n   - `powershell.exe` loads `mscoree.dll` and `clr.dll`. These are components of the .NET Framework, which is often used in malware for evasion techniques like obfuscation or encoding.\n\nGiven these activities, there are several potential indicators of malicious behavior:\n\n- The deletion of files in the Temp directory.\n- The use of PowerShell for multiple operations, including accessing a potentially harmful DLL and deleting files.\n- The execution of `whoami.exe`, which could indicate an attempt to gather information for privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nTo investigate further, you should consider:\n\n- Checking if any malicious files (e.g., `entrada_principal.zip`) were present in the Temp directory before they were deleted.\n- Looking for other suspicious activities around the time of these events.\n- Monitoring for any abnormal behavior from this machine in the future."}
