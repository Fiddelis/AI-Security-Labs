These scheduled tasks create persistent commands to execute `calc.exe` on startup and logon, which is highly suspicious. While `calc.exe` itself isn't inherently malicious, its use within scheduled tasks like this is a common tactic to mask malicious payloads or establish persistence.  The repeated use of `svchost.exe` along with frequent registry modifications and file creation of scheduled tasks indicates potential automated malicious activity or configuration changes. Further investigation is warranted.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
