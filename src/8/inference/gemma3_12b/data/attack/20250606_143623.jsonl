{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"The provided log data suggests a suspicious and potentially malicious activity occurring on the system. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why it's concerning:\n\n**1. Initial Suspicious Activity: File Deletion and Process Creation**\n\n*   **`{\"process\":\"{'command_line': 'powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\" -BinaryPathName \\\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\\\"\\\\nStart-Service -Name \\\"objeto_ativo\\\"}'}\",\"winlog\":\"{'task': 'Provider Lifecycle'}\",\"file\":\"None\"}` (Repeated Several Times):**  This is the most critical finding.  This indicates the attacker is using PowerShell to create a new Windows service named \"objeto_ativo\".  Let's break this down further:\n    *   **`powershell.exe`:** This is the PowerShell executable.  While legitimate for system administration, it's also a common tool for attackers due to its flexibility.\n    *   **`New-Service`:**  This is a PowerShell cmdlet used to create a new Windows service.  Creating a service allows code to run automatically in the background, often with elevated privileges.  This is a *major* red flag.\n    *   **`\"objeto_ativo\"`:** The *name* of the service being created.  It's a non-standard name, which suggests it's being used by the attacker.  Pay close attention to this name if you need to investigate further.\n    *   **`\"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\"`:** This is the path to the executable file that will be run by the new service.  The use of \"unidade_logico\", \"registro_comum\", \"entrada_base\" in the path strongly suggests a targeted attack rather than a random occurrence. These names imply the attacker has some familiarity with the system's structure or is trying to disguise the executable.  **This is the most important file to analyze!**\n    *   **`Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"`:**  This line immediately starts the newly created service.  This means the malicious code is being executed almost instantly.\n*   The repetition of this command multiple times in the log data confirms a deliberate attempt to establish persistence.\n\n**2. Subsequent Activity (Likely Related):**\n\n*   **Registry Changes:**  The `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` entries with \"Registry value set\" events are common in Windows systems, but may be related to the setup or execution of the malicious service.\n*   **Image Loading:** `sppsvc.exe` loading `taskschd.dll` could indicate the attacker may be trying to leverage the Windows Task Scheduler for future persistence.\n\n**Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n*   **Filename:** `tarefa_logico.exe` (located at `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\`) - This should be isolated, analyzed (reverse engineered if possible), and blocked.\n*   **Service Name:** `objeto_ativo` -  This service must be identified and removed from the system.\n*   **Directory Path:** `C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\` – This entire directory should be investigated for other suspicious files.\n*   **PowerShell Script:** The PowerShell script used to create the service (the full command line from the logs) – this needs to be analyzed for any hidden functionality.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Isolate the System:** Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further communication and potential spread to other systems.\n2.  **Analyze `tarefa_logico.exe`:** This is the priority. Upload it to a sandbox environment (like VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, or a dedicated malware analysis tool) to determine its functionality.  Consider engaging a professional malware analyst.\n3.  **Remove the Service:**  Use the `sc delete objeto_ativo` command (as administrator) to remove the malicious service.  Make sure the service is *completely* removed – check registry entries as well.\n4.  **Check the Registry:** Search the Windows Registry for any entries related to `objeto_ativo` or the suspicious directory paths. Remove any malicious entries.  Be very careful when making changes to the registry.\n5.  **Scan for Rootkit:** Run a comprehensive rootkit scan using a reputable anti-rootkit tool. The attacker may have attempted to hide their activities.\n6.  **Review Account Privileges:**  Examine user accounts and group memberships to see if any have been compromised.\n7.  **Monitor System Activity:** Implement robust system monitoring and auditing to detect any unusual activity in the future.\n8.  **Investigate Lateral Movement:** Determine if the attacker has moved to other systems on the network.\n\n**Severity:**  **Critical**.  This represents a serious compromise of the system, likely involving a targeted attack. The creation of a persistent service is a strong indicator of an attacker's intent to maintain control.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** The analysis provided is based solely on the provided log data. A full investigation may reveal additional indicators of compromise.  Engage cybersecurity professionals for a more thorough assessment and remediation."}
