The scripts reference non-existent files (`c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which could be an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity or create a beacon that will fail gracefully but may eventually be replaced.  The creation of the 'win32times' task is suspicious, especially combined with the registry modifications by `cmd.exe` and the PowerShell invocations. The repeated registry modifications by 'svchost.exe' are also notable, even though less directly suspicious.  The inclusion of 'whoami.exe' is consistent with reconnaissance activity. This collection of events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
