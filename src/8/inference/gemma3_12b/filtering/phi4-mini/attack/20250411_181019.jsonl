Multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes are involved, often executing commands that seem designed to run scripts from unusual locations (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1). The frequency of registry modifications across multiple processes warrants investigation.  Furthermore, the repeated execution of services.exe is unusual and potentially malicious. The presence of Chrome and other common processes interspersed with the suspicious activities requires further analysis to understand the overall attack chain.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
