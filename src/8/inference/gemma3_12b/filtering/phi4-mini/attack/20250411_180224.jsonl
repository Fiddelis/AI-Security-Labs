The scheduled tasks are named 'win32times' and reference scripts ('c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'). The use of 'system' as the run user for the scheduled task, coupled with the unconventional PowerShell scripts, strongly suggests potential malicious activity such as persistence or lateral movement. Furthermore, the prevalence of 'chrome.exe' registry modifications while less indicative, warrants further investigation alongside other findings. The combination of these factors elevates the risk profile significantly.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
