Chrome.exe network connections are normal, but the repeated and complex PowerShell command lines (using `net user`, `get-localuser`, `cmdkey.exe`, `ls`, `get-childitem`, `get-localgroup`, `nnet localgroup`) suggest reconnaissance or credential harvesting attempts. The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1`) is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection. The loading of .NET related DLLs also points to potentially sophisticated techniques.
