{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"The script appears to be a malicious PowerShell script designed to disable security measures and potentially deploy further malware. Here's a breakdown of the observed activity and a high-level assessment:\n\n**Key Activities & Observations:**\n\n* **File Deletion:** Multiple DLL files are deleted (`WimProvider.dll`, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`), which suggests an attempt to disrupt system operations or remove traces of a previous infection.  Deleting `WimProvider.dll` is especially concerning because it could lead to issues with Windows Imaging.\n* **PowerShell Usage:** The script heavily utilizes PowerShell for its operations.  This is typical of modern malware, as PowerShell provides a powerful scripting environment built into Windows.\n* **Registry Modification:** `svchost.exe` and `powershell.exe` modify registry values. This could be to adjust system behavior, disable security features, or set up persistence mechanisms.\n* **Image Loading:** `powershell.exe` loads several .NET framework DLLs, which are commonly used by legitimate applications, but also by malicious ones to execute code.\n* **File Creation:** `powershell.exe` creates a file in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell`. This new file appears to be named `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`.  It's a clear sign of persistence.\n* **Zip File Removal:**  The line `Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force` indicates that an attacker created an archive named `entrada_principal.zip` in the temp folder and intends to remove it.\n* **`whoami.exe`:** Running `whoami.exe` is a common tactic to gather information about the current user and permissions.\n* **Startup Profile Data:** The script creates and possibly modifies the startup profile data, which could be used to automatically execute malicious code on system startup.\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nThis is highly indicative of malware activity.  The combination of file deletion, registry modification, PowerShell usage, startup profile manipulation, and file removal suggests an attempt to compromise the system, disable security measures, and potentially install additional malicious software.\nIt's designed for persistence and attempting to hide its tracks.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Immediate Scan:**  Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus\/antimalware tool.\n* **Isolate the Machine:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread.\n* **Memory Dump:** Perform a memory dump of the compromised system to analyze the malicious processes in more detail.\n* **Investigate the \"entrada_principal.zip\" File:** Determine where this ZIP file originated.\n* **Review User Accounts:**  Check user accounts for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.\n* **Review System Logs:** Analyze event logs for errors, warnings, and suspicious events.\n* **Rebuild\/Clean the System:** In severe cases, consider rebuilding or thoroughly cleaning the affected system from scratch.\n* **Forensic Investigation:** Engage a digital forensics expert to conduct a thorough investigation and determine the full extent of the compromise."}
