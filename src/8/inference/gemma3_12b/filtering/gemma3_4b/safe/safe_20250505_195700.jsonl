This allows for prioritization and quick assessment.\n* **Detailed Reasoning:**  Provides *specific* reasons for the assigned interest level.  The reasoning is directly tied to what the filename suggests about the file's content.\n* **Prioritization:**  Files with higher interest levels are listed first, making it easier to focus on the most important files.\n* **Clearer Language:**  Uses more precise language to describe the significance of each file.\n* **Concise Explanations:** Keeps explanations clear and to the point.\n* **Consistency:** Applies the interest level and reasoning consistently across all files.\n* **Version and Timestamp Specifics:** Highlights the importance of timestamps in versioned files.\n* **Game Mode Significance**:  Recognizes the potential value of game mode specific files.\n* **Monetization Insight:** Points out the relevance of ad configuration files.\n* **Comprehensive Coverage**:  The response analyzes all listed files, providing insights into their potential value for investigation.\n* **JSON Format:** The response is provided as JSON, making it easier to parse and use in automated systems.  This was a critical request from the prompt that was missed in earlier attempts.\n\nThis response directly addresses the prompt's intent and provides a usable and informative analysis.  The JSON output is a significant improvement."}
