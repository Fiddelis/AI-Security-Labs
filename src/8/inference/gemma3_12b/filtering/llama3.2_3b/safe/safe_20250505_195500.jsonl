Let's break down what's happening and what it likely signifies.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` - This is a Microsoft Office process related to background tasks, often involving downloading, caching, or updating components.  It's not inherently malicious, but its behavior should be monitored, especially if unexpected.\n*   **Action:** File Creation - The process is repeatedly creating new files.\n*   **File Type:** `officeaicopilot-strings.min` - These appear to be minified JavaScript files, likely related to Microsoft's Copilot AI features within Microsoft Office applications.  \"Minified\" means the code has been compressed to reduce file size, making it harder to read.\n*   **Location:** `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPacks\\8.0\\OfflineFiles` -  This is a directory used for caching files to allow offline access to Microsoft Office content.\n*   **Repetitive Creation:** The same file names are created multiple times (e.g., `7bbcea0e29cbd6a23375d3e16b983098.js` appears twice).  This repetition suggests a potential issue or a background process re-attempting a download or update.\n\n**Possible Interpretations & Potential Issues:**\n\n1.  **Normal Operation (Most Likely):**  Microsoft Office is downloading and caching resources for its Copilot AI features.  The repetitive creation is potentially due to retries in case of network interruptions, checksum verification or just the way the caching system works.\n2.  **Network Issues:**  Intermittent network connectivity could be causing the downloads to fail and retry, leading to repeated file creation.\n3.  **Corrupted Cache:** A corrupted cache could cause the process to repeatedly attempt to download and create files.\n4.  **Software Bug:** A bug in the Microsoft Office or SDXHelper.exe could be causing the process to behave unexpectedly.\n5.  **Malware Activity (Less Likely, but Possible):** While SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, malware *can* sometimes masquerade as legitimate processes.  The repeated creation of files might be part of a larger malicious operation. **This is less likely given the file names and location, but shouldn't be completely ruled out without further investigation.**\n\n**Recommendations for Investigation & Remediation:**\n\n1.  **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure a stable internet connection. Run speed tests.\n2.  **Restart Microsoft Office:** This can often clear temporary glitches.\n3.  **Restart Computer:**  A full system restart can sometimes resolve background process issues.\n4.  **Update Microsoft Office:** Make sure Office is up to date with the latest patches and fixes.\n5.  **Check Disk Space:**  Ensure there's adequate free space on the system drive (C:). Low disk space can cause process failures.\n6.  **Run Antivirus\/Antimalware Scan:**  Perform a full system scan with a reputable antivirus or antimalware program.\n7.  **Monitor Process Activity (Advanced):** Use Task Manager or a process monitoring tool (like Process Explorer) to observe the behavior of SDXHelper.exe over time.  See how frequently it creates files, how much data it's transferring, and any unusual CPU\/memory usage.\n8.  **Clean Office Cache (Advanced):**  Microsoft provides steps to clear the Office cache.  Search online for \"clear Microsoft Office cache\" for specific instructions. **Be aware that this might temporarily impact offline functionality.**\n9.  **Examine Event Logs:**  Check the Windows Event Viewer (particularly the Application and System logs) for any errors or warnings related to Microsoft Office or SDXHelper.exe.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:**  Without more context (e.g., recent software installations, network changes, error messages), it's difficult to definitively diagnose the root cause.
