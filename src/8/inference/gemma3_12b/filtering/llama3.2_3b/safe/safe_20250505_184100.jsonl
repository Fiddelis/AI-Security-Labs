Notably, `Update.exe` is frequently accessed and executes, which is unusual for a typical application.  The command lines observed for Discord processes include several unusual flags and parameters (e.g., `--type=crashpad-handler`, `--type=gpu-process`, `--type=utility`, specific `mojo-platform-channel-handle` values) suggesting potentially customized or malicious activity.  The `Update.exe` also interacts with `mscoree.dll`, and frequently creates pipes.
