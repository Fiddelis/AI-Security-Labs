Multiple `certutil` instances with unusual command lines are present, coupled with the creation and execution of decoded files. The presence of `powershell` and `cmd.exe` further suggest a possible scripting-based attack. Chrome's registry changes, while potentially benign, warrant further scrutiny in conjunction with the other activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
