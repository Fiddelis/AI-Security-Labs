The repetitive use of similar commands, and the `Engine Lifecycle` event associated with these actions, indicate a likely reconnaissance or information gathering attempt, possibly part of a larger attack sequence. The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script (likely a test of PowerShell execution policy) strengthens suspicion of malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
