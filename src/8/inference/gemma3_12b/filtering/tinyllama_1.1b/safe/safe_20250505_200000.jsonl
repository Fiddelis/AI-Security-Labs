The presence of ImageLoad events loading urlmon.dll from multiple processes (WindowsCamera.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, SDXHelper.exe) coupled with the RegistryEvent modifications is concerning, as it might point to exploitation attempts leveraging DLL hijacking. The special logons and multiple logon events for services.exe are also noteworthy. The winlogbeat events are likely benign but should be considered in context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
