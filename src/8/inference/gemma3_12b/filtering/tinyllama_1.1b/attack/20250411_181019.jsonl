The service creation and deletion pattern, in conjunction with the script execution attempt, suggests potential malicious intent, such as persistent backdoor establishment or data exfiltration. Chrome's interaction with AMSI and Windows Defender DLLs, while common, also warrants attention in this context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
