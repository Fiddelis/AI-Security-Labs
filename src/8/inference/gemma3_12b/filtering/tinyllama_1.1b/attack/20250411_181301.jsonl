The use of `tasklist.exe` followed by DLL loads from unusual paths (wbem, Defender, amsi) warrants further investigation. Additionally, PowerShell file creation ('registro_auxiliar.txt') and persistent registry modifications by Chrome are also suspicious. Winlogbeat installation also observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
