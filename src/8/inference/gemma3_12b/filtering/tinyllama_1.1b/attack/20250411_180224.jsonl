The use of 'system' as the run user and bypassing PowerShell execution policy ('-ep bypass') are significant red flags.  Creation of a scheduled task via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe using a non-existent PowerShell script is highly suspicious. The presence of file creation by svchost.exe related to the task also reinforces the potential maliciousness.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
