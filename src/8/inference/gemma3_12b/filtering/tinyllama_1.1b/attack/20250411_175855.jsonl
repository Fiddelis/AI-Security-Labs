A directory listing command (`dir .key`) within a `cmd.exe` process is particularly concerning.  The presence of a `findstr` command searching for `.key` suggests potential credential harvesting. The presence of file creation events related to a winlogbeat installation and a named task (`tarefa_geral.txt`) warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
