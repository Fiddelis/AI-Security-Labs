Notably, there are file creation events associated with PowerShell for both a startup profile in the AppData directory and an arbitrary download path. Additionally, numerous registry modifications by various processes (including conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and chrome.exe) could indicate attempts to alter system configurations or establish persistence. The use of Chrome is particularly notable due to its repeated registry operations, which may be indicative of a browser-based attack vector.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
