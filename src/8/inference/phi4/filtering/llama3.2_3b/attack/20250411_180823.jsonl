Multiple processes like svchost.exe and schtasks.exe are involved in creating scheduled tasks, which could be used to establish persistence or execute malicious commands at startup. The use of powershell.exe for registry modifications is notable since PowerShell scripts can be used for legitimate purposes but often serve as vectors for executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the presence of whoami.exe being executed suggests attempts to gather system information, possibly in preparation for further attacks. All these elements combined suggest a need for further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
