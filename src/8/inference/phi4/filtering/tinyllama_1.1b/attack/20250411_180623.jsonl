{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180623.jsonl","analysis":"```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated PowerShell executions with suspicious patterns, including file deletions and registry modifications, which are often associated with malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Repeated Usage of PowerShell**: The logs show multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is used to execute commands (`Get-Date`). While legitimate use of PowerShell does exist, repeated and varied tasks can be indicative of scripting behavior common in malicious activities.\n\n2. **File Deletion Event**: There's an event showing the deletion of a file located at `C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xz0wqw5j.ptd.ps1`. The naming convention and location could suggest script obfuscation or cleanup activity often associated with malware trying to cover its tracks.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Several events involve `powershell.exe` modifying registry values, a common technique used by attackers to maintain persistence on the system.\n\n4. **Image Load Events**: Loading DLLs such as `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, and others using PowerShell might be part of legitimate operations but could also indicate malicious behavior if these files are loaded in an unusual context or sequence.\n\n5. **Process Access and Lifecycle Events**: Multiple process lifecycle events with no apparent legitimate reason can signal the presence of malware leveraging scripting for automation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the combination of these patterns across multiple log entries raises a red flag that warrants further investigation into potential malicious activity on the system. The confidence level reflects the strong indicators present but acknowledges that not all PowerShell use is inherently malicious without further context."}
