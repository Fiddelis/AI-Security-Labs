The use of powershell.exe to set registry values and create files is notable due to its versatility in scripting both benign and malicious actions. Additionally, cmd.exe and tasklist.exe are being utilized for process listing, which may suggest reconnaissance or pre-attack activities. These combined factors increase the likelihood of a potential security threat.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The confidence level reflects high suspicion due to the repetition and potential impact of such actions but acknowledges the possibility that these could be benign if related to legitimate updates or extensions."}
