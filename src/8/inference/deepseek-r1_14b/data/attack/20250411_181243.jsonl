{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system logs to determine if they're relevant for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first few events involve processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Powershell is commonly used in scripting, but it's also often associated with malicious activities because it has powerful cmdlets that can be misused. The whoami.exe process seems benign as it's typically used to get user information, so that alone might not raise a flag.\n\nNext, I notice multiple events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, etc. While these could be normal for Powershell scripts running .NET code, the repeated access and loading of these files might indicate some unusual activity, especially if they're part of a script that's being executed multiple times.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where a file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1. This seems suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection. Malware often does this to leave minimal traces.\n\nThe command line arguments for powershell.exe contain commands like net user, get-localuser, etc. These commands are used to query system information about users and groups. If these are part of a script without clear legitimate purpose, they might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nAdditionally, the process events show that the same Powershell command is being executed multiple times. Repetitive execution of the same or similar commands could be an attempt to run malicious code in different contexts or to bypass certain security mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these points together: repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines, creation and deletion of a script file in Temp, and multiple registry accesses and image loads suggest a possible attack. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination indicates malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines, including file creation\/deletion in Temp directory and repeated registry access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event, it's a PowerShell process with a command line that includes several commands: net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls and dir commands on C:\\Users, and some net localgroup calls. This immediately raises my suspicion because PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks but can also be a tool for attackers. The combination of these commands seems like someone might be gathering user information, checking group memberships, or attempting to manipulate the system.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is launched and interacts with other processes, accessing images and files. There's even a file creation event by PowerShell in a user's Downloads folder. This could indicate that data is being exfiltrated or malicious scripts are being written.\n\nI also notice several instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used with commands like \"net user\" and \"net localgroup\". These are standard network commands but can be misused to modify user accounts or group policies, which might be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nLooking further down, there's a cmdkey.exe command run with \/list. I remember that cmdkey is used for credential management, so this could mean the process is accessing stored credentials, which is another red flag if not authorized.\n\nThere are multiple events labeled under 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management'. These types of activities can be legitimate but in combination with other suspicious behaviors might indicate an attacker trying to modify user permissions or group memberships for unauthorized access.\n\nAlso, there's a Registry value being set by both PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changes to the registry are significant because they can alter system configurations and persistence mechanisms. Attackers often use registry modifications to maintain access over time.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events don't have a process or file associated with them, which might be intentional but could also mean there's something being hidden, like data exfiltration without writing to standard files, or perhaps an attempt to avoid detection by not creating certain logs.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially dangerous commands, use of net.exe and cmdkey.exe for user and credential information, file creations in user directories, registry modifications, and repeated security group management events. This combination doesn't look like normal user activity or even routine system administration. It seems more aligned with someone probing the system, gathering information, possibly setting up backdoors, or executing malicious activities.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these actions could fit into different stages of an attack lifecycle. For example, initial access might involve one of these commands, followed by credential dumping using cmdkey.exe, then lateral movement via net.exe to target other systems or users. The file creations and registry changes could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nGiven all this, I would classify the batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination suggests potentially malicious activity rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASON\": \"The log entries indicate potential unauthorized system access and manipulation, including use of PowerShell for commands that could gather user information, modify group memberships, and set registry values. These activities may suggest malicious intent or unauthorized administrative actions.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since many system processes interact with the registry. Next, there are multiple powershell.exe instances accessing processes and setting registry values. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, in this case, it's just accessing processes and registry without any unusual commands.\n\nLooking at the third event, winlogbeat.exe created a file in its own directory. That makes sense as part of log shipping or data collection, so no red flags there.\n\nThere are two instances where notepad.exe sets registry values. Again, Notepad is a common application, and such actions aren't inherently suspicious without more context like unusual reg keys accessed.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal because system32 files are standard. Similarly, Calculator.exe doing the same thing doesn't raise any concerns.\n\nMultiple svchost.exe setting registry values could be tricky since svchost can host various services, but again, in this case, it's just normal operations without any signs of tampering or unauthorized access.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution is also notable. It's a common tool for users to check permissions, so unless there's an unusual account activity, it doesn't signal malicious intent.\n\nOverall, while there are multiple events from powershell.exe and process creations, none of them indicate malicious behavior. They all seem within the realm of normal system operations. Thereâ€™s no evidence of unusual file accesses, registry modifications in protected areas, or signs of persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this batch doesn't warrant an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes accessing resources and performing tasks such as registry updates, file creations, and process monitoring, which do not indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
