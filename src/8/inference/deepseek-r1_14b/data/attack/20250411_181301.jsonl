{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, tasklist.exe, conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. These are all common system and application processes, so nothing immediately suspicious there.\n\nThe events show various tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, etc. Many of these are routine actions. For example, cmd.exe being used to run tasklist is normal for checking running processes. The use of powershell.exe could be concerning since it's often used by attackers, but in some cases, it's legitimate too.\n\nI notice that svchost.exe and other system processes are accessing the registryâ€”this is standard behavior. Chrome.exe has multiple RegistryEvent tasks, which is expected as browsers interact with the registry for settings. Also, chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll seems normal since those are part of Windows Defender.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory might be setting up logs, which isn't unusual unless it's accessing restricted areas. The creation of registro_auxiliar.txt by powershell.exe could be writing to a file, but without more context on what's inside or how it's used, it's hard to say.\n\nNo file paths seem malicious at first glance, and all processes are using standard system files. There's no evidence of known malicious behaviors like creating hidden files, accessing restricted areas, or unusual network traffic mentioned here.\n\nConsidering the lack of anomalies and everything seeming within normal operational parameters, this batch doesn't raise red flags. The confidence level is high that these events don't indicate malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of routine system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and image loading without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181301.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got a batch of JSONL events to analyze. Each event has a process name as chrome.exe, a winlog task about setting a registry value, and no file involved.\n\nFirst, I should consider what each field represents. Chrome.exe is a common process, so it's not inherently suspicious on its own. The RegistryEvent task indicates that there was a change to the Windows registry, which can be normal for software installations or updates.\n\nLooking at all events together, they're all from the same process and involve similar actions. There are nine entries here, which might seem repetitive. But is this volume unusual? Well, legitimate software updates or configuration changes could cause multiple registry writes, so that's not a red flag on its own.\n\nThe absence of any file information in each event makes me think there's no file operation being logged alongside the registry change. If it were malicious, maybe they'd be writing to files as well, but here, it's just registry modifications.\n\nI should also consider context I know about such events. Sometimes, scripts or legitimate software perform multiple registry writes during startup or configuration. Without additional information like timestamps or source IP addresses, it's hard to tell if these are part of a larger pattern of malicious activity.\n\nSince each event is isolated and lacks indicators beyond the process and registry task, there's not enough evidence here to suggest anything suspicious. It doesn't trigger any alarms for me. Therefore, I don't see a reason to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe without any file involvement, which is not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
