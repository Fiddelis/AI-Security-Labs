{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided JSONL events to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and look for patterns or signs of malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first four events, they all involve 'chrome.exe' with network connection detections. That's normal since Chrome handles networking.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances where 'powershell.exe' is accessed and some registry interactions. PowerShell can be legitimate but also commonly used in attacks, so I should keep an eye on these.\n\nThen there's a 'whoami.exe' process created. This is often used to check user information, which can be part of reconnaissance or more malicious activities.\n\nThe events with 'cmd.exe' executing csc.exe and compiling C# code are concerning. Compiling code from untrusted sources can indicate script-based attacks, which are hard to detect but common in malware.\n\nThe creation of various .exe files in temporary directories, like pacote_padrao.exe and others, raises suspicion. Malware often creates new executables to hide its activities or drop payloads.\n\nRegistry modifications using these processes could be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nProcesses named 'modulo_secundario.exe' and similar terms suggest they might be components of a larger malicious payload, possibly dropped by the initial scripts.\n\nThe termination of 'elemento_ativo.exe' might signal that it was run as part of an attack, then cleaned up to avoid detection.\n\nMultiple RegistryEvent tasks across different processes indicate potential tampering with system settings, which is often seen in attacks trying to maintain access or hide their tracks.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of using PowerShell and cmd to execute scripts, creating new executables, modifying registry entries, and loading images from temporary files suggests a possible script-based attack. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior, especially since they involve process creation, file operations, and registry changes that could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities including PowerShell access, command-line execution of scripts, file creation in temporary directories, and registry modifications. These patterns suggest possible malicious behavior such as script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events here. Each line has three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\n1. The first event is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal because calc often loads system DLLs.\n2. Next, svchost.exe sets a registry value. Svchost is a known process for services, so registry access isn't unusual here.\n3. Another svchost.exe doing the same thing as above—registry writes are common for services.\n4. Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same as the first event, nothing suspicious.\n5. Svchost.exe again modifying the registry—not a red flag on its own.\n6. Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That's part of normal logging activity; winlogbeat is likely running to collect logs, so this seems fine.\n7. ApplicationFrameHost.exe writing to the registry—this process is related to app containers, so registry writes are expected.\n8. Calculator.exe setting a registry value. Again, not unusual for an application to access the registry.\n9. Powershell.exe modifying the registry. Now, powershell can be used maliciously, but it's also common for legitimate admin tasks. One instance isn't enough to raise flags, but multiple might be worth looking at.\n10. Powershell.exe accessing a process—another normal action, could be part of scripting or administration.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple chrome.exe events:\n- Several instances where chrome sets registry values. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions, so this is typical.\n- A couple of ImageLoad events loading system DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll—these are legitimate Windows components used by applications.\n\nAnother winlogbeat event at the end doing the same file creation as before—consistent behavior expected from the tool.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show a mix of normal processes accessing registry values, loading DLLs, and creating files. While there's an instance of powershell.exe modifying the registry, which could be concerning, it's just one event without any additional suspicious actions. Chrome's multiple registry writes are within expected behavior given its nature.\n\nI don't see evidence of malicious activities like unusual file creations, process spawning, or network connections. All events seem to align with standard system operations for these processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activity such as legitimate processes accessing registry values and loading DLLs, without signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
