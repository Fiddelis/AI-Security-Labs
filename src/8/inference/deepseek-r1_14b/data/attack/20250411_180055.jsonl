{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. The user provided a JSONL log with multiple entries related to PowerShell executions and various file operations. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. So, any unusual activity with PowerShell should raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is creating new processes (`Process Create`) and accessing registry values (`Registry value set`). These actions in isolation aren't necessarily malicious but could be part of a larger campaign. For example, modifying registry keys might be used to persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAnother red flag is the repeated use of Compress-Archive commands with paths that seem to involve temporary directories and ZIP files. This suggests that the script is compressing files from various locations on the disk and saving them to the TEMP directory. While compression isn't inherently malicious, using it across multiple directories might indicate data exfiltration or the creation of a backdoor.\n\nThere's also an instance where a file named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1` is created and then immediately deleted. This behavior is suspicious because creating and deleting files quickly can be a way to test permissions or hide evidence, especially if the script contains malicious commands.\n\nAdditionally, several events mention tasks like Image Load and Provider Lifecycle, which are typical for process initialization but might be worth monitoring if they occur频繁 with PowerShell.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell executions, file operations that could indicate data gathering or exfiltration, quick file creation\/deletion, and potential registry modifications. These activities collectively suggest a possible malicious script attempting to do something nefarious on the system.\n\nHowever, without seeing the exact content of these scripts or additional context like timestamps and user permissions, it's challenging to be certain. But based on the available data, there's enough concerning behavior that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with Compress-Archive commands targeting various directories, including temporary files and deletion. This activity could indicate potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system manipulation.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see multiple entries involving powershell.exe with command lines that use Compress-Archive. This seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used in attacks, especially when compressing files. The paths mentioned like \"bin\\\\componente_auxiliar\" or \"modulo_temporario\" look like they're dealing with temporary or auxiliary components, which might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and creates files, such as in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. These actions can indicate an attempt to persist across reboots or alter system configurations, which is concerning for potential malware activity.\n\nI also notice several other processes accessing the registry and creating files, like winlogbeat.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, and others. While some of these are legitimate system processes, the frequency and combination might raise flags. For example, svchost.exe being involved in registry changes multiple times could be suspicious since it's often used by malware to hide activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where files like MpClient.dll and Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1 are loaded or accessed. These could be legitimate system files, but their use alongside powershell.exe commands might indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities or execute malicious scripts.\n\nThe fact that many of these events occur in quick succession and involve multiple processes interacting with the file system and registry suggests a coordinated effort, possibly indicating an attack vector such as lateral movement within a network or data exfiltration. The repeated use of Compress-Archive could be part of packing malicious files to avoid detection or preparing for data transfer.\n\nOverall, while some events on their own might not be alarming, the combination of using powershell.exe with specific commands, registry modifications, and file operations across various processes points towards potentially malicious behavior that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell command lines indicate potential malicious activity involving file compression and manipulation. Combined with registry access and file creation events, this suggests possible exploit attempts or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries from chrome.exe. Most of them have the task as 'Registry value set' under the rule 'RegistryEvent'. That means Chrome is making changes to the Windows registry. I wonder if that's normal. I know that some legitimate software does modify the registry when installing or updating, so this might not be suspicious on its own. But since there are multiple such events in a row, maybe it's part of an update process.\n\nThen, one of the chrome.exe entries shows 'Image loaded' for amsi.dll. That stands out because AMsi is related to anti-malware scanning. Malicious processes might try to load this DLL to bypass detection. However, I also know that legitimate applications can use it. So this event alone isn't conclusive.\n\nAnother chrome.exe entry loads MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That seems less suspicious since it's a Microsoft file and likely part of normal operations.\n\nMoving on, there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe creating a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is a known tool for collecting Windows logs, so this activity is expected if it's running as part of system monitoring. No red flags here.\n\nNext, powershell.exe appears twice with 'Process accessed' tasks. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. However, without seeing the actual command or script executed, it's hard to tell. But since there are only access events and no signs of executing commands, this might not be concerning yet.\n\nLastly, whoami.exe is run from the system32 directory. Whoami is a standard Windows utility used to display user information. Its execution here doesn't raise any alarms unless it's part of an attack chain, but without more context, it seems benign.\n\nPutting all these together, none of the individual events are overtly malicious. The repeated registry changes by Chrome could be part of updates or installations. The DLL loads don't indicate anything suspicious without additional context. PowerShell and whoami.exe activities don't show any unusual behavior in their events, and winlogbeat is a legitimate process.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of chrome.exe events with similar tasks might be worth monitoring to ensure they're not part of an ongoing malicious activity that's generating multiple logs. But based on the information given, there's no clear evidence of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as Chrome modifying the registry and loading legitimate DLLs, Winlogbeat creating configuration files, PowerShell access without malicious commands, and whoami.exe execution. No signs of suspicious or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
