{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to chrome.exe making network connections and DNS queries. That doesn't seem too suspicious on its own because browsers do that all the time for normal browsing activity. So those could be benign.\n\nThen I see some events involving powershell.exe. The command line in one of them stands out: it's using powershell to download a file from a GitHub repository into the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and can execute arbitrary code. Downloading files directly, especially from raw.githubusercontent.com, could be part of malicious activity like downloading a script or payload.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, which is normal as it loads various DLLs, but the fact that they're all related to .NET frameworks makes me think maybe some unusual modules are being loaded. However, without more context, I'm not sure if this alone is suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created in the TEMP directory and then immediately deleted. This behavior could be an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on disk. If files are created and deleted quickly, it's harder for defenders to track.\n\nAdditionally, there are several Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe with similar command lines. Each is attempting to download a file from different GitHub paths into the TEMP directory. The repetitive pattern suggests that this might be part of a script or looped process trying multiple files or modules, which could indicate an attempt to gather components for malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows legitimate browser activity but also signs of potential malicious behavior using PowerShell to download files from GitHub and attempts to hide file creation. The combination of downloading multiple files, creating temporary files, deleting them quickly, and the use of raw.githubusercontent domains (which are often used by attackers for C2 or dropping payloads) makes this batch worth investigating further.\n\nI'm not entirely certain if each action is malicious on its own, but the overall pattern raises concerns about potential attacker activities. The confidence level isn't very high because some events could be part of normal operations, but the concerning indicators tilt it towards being interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub domains into TEMP directories and deleting them.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, and I need to look at them all together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first few events are PowerShell processes downloading files from GitHub repositories. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files, but the file paths in the command line suggest that these might be part of a script execution. This could be normal admin activity or it could be malicious since downloading files via PowerShell can often be used for lateral movement or exfiltration.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. Chrome does update its settings and sometimes writes to the registry, but doing so repeatedly might indicate some kind of persistence mechanism or tampering with system configurations.\n\nLooking further, there's a process named conhost.exe setting registry values. Conhost is typically used for console applications, but seeing it interact with the registry could be suspicious if not related to normal operations.\n\nThere are also events from MpDefenderCoreService.exe showing network connections. This seems less concerning since it's part of Windows Defender, which would naturally make network calls to update definitions or scan for threats.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding logs, so this could be legitimate. However, the path mentioned (winlogbeat.yml.new) might indicate a configuration file being updated or created, which should be monitored but not necessarily suspicious on its own.\n\nNotepad.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are also setting registry values, which could be part of their normal operations, especially if they're handling certain settings or configurations.\n\nNow, considering the batch as a whole: there's a lot of activity from PowerShell executing commands that download files. The repeated downloads from different GitHub repositories might indicate an attempt to retrieve multiple components or modules, possibly for malicious purposes like installing tools or establishing persistence. Additionally, the registry modifications by various processes (including Chrome and conhost) could be part of creating persistence points or altering system behavior in a way that's not easily reversible.\n\nThe fact that multiple PowerShell instances are involved in downloading files from different locations is concerning because it could be an indicator of script execution or payload delivery. It's also worth noting the specific file paths being written to, like TEMP and User directories, which might suggest temporary storage before further actions.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these activities (like Chrome registry writes) are normal for application updates or settings changes. However, when combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises the suspicion that there's a coordinated effort to modify system configurations in a way that could be malicious.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate because while the activities aren't definitively malicious, they do present several red flags that warrant closer investigation. The combination of multiple file downloads via PowerShell and registry modifications across different processes suggests potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from GitHub repositories and modifying system configurations, along with unusual registry activity from various processes, indicate potential malicious activities or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 70\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of log events. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to figure out if these logs are interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one and see what's happening. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. There are several processes being logged here: calc.exe, svchost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, conhost.exe, and reg.exe.\n\nStarting with the first event:\n- Process: calc.exe (which is typically not malicious)\n- Event: Image loaded\n- File: C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll\n\nHmm, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows file. So this seems normal.\n\nSecond event:\n- Process: svchost.exe (a common process for services, can be both legitimate and malicious)\n- Event: Registry value set\nThis could be part of normal operation, but since it's happening multiple times with the same task, I'll keep an eye on that.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple instances where svchost.exe is setting registry values. That might be a red flag because attackers often use legitimate processes like svchost to hide their activities. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just normal service behavior.\n\nAnother event catches my attention:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Event: Process accessed and Registry value set\n\nPowerShell is commonly used by both administrators and attackers. The command line isn't provided here, but multiple accesses and registry modifications might indicate suspicious activity. Attackers often use PowerShell for execution of malicious scripts or to modify system configurations.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe event with a command line:\n- Command: SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F\nThis looks like it's deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\".Scheduled tasks being deleted could be an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms. If the task was created by malicious software, this would be a way to cover tracks.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event deletes a registry key:\n- REG DELETE HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \/V \"modulo_temporario\"\nDeleting entries in the Run key suggests an attempt to remove something that runs at startup. Again, attackers might do this to remove their own tools or scripts from running on startup.\n\nThere's also a reg.exe event deleting another registry value:\n- REG DELETE HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \/V \"pacote_auxiliar\"\nThis reinforces the idea that something is cleaning up after itself in the system, which is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple process creations and accesses involving conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami is often used to gather information about the current user or system, which can be part of reconnaissance activities. Conhost.exe is usually related to console services but could be abused in certain contexts.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a pattern here of processes modifying the registry, deleting scheduled tasks, and removing entries from the Run key. These actions are often associated with malware trying to remove evidence of its presence or attempting to disable protective measures. While some of these activities can be legitimate (e.g., system administration), the frequency and combination of events suggest potential malicious behavior.\n\nI should also consider whether there's any indication of actual exploitation or data exfiltration in these logs, but since the logs only show process activity and registry changes, it's hard to tell. However, the repeated attempts to delete tasks and registry entries are concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual events might not be suspicious on their own, the overall pattern raises red flags about possible malicious activities related to system configuration and persistence removal.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided log events indicates a potential security concern due to a series of activities that may suggest malicious intent. Here's the organized conclusion:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **svchost.exe Activity**: Multiple instances of svchost.exe setting registry values could indicate suspicious behavior, as attackers often use legitimate processes to hide their activities.\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage**: The frequent access and modification of registry entries by powershell.exe are concerning. PowerShell is a common tool for both administrators and attackers, and such activity may signify malicious intent without additional context.\n\n3. **Scheduled Task Deletion**: cmd.exe deleting scheduled tasks (e.g., \"spawn\") suggests attempts to remove persistence mechanisms, which is typical in malware efforts to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Registry Key Modifications**: Multiple deletions of entries in the Run key using both cmd.exe and reg.exe indicate an effort to eliminate startup programs, possibly to remove malicious software or scripts.\n\n5. **Process Creations and Accesses**: The use of conhost.exe and whoami.exe, along with other processes, may be part of reconnaissance activities or efforts to modify system configurations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile individual events might not be suspicious, the cumulative pattern of registry modifications, task deletions, and removal of startup entries raises concerns about potential malicious activities. These actions are often associated with malware attempting to clean up its traces or disable protective measures. Further investigation is recommended to confirm if these activities are part of a coordinated attack or legitimate system administration tasks."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's look at the events.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell processes. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it has built-in cmdlets that can do a variety of tasks, both legitimate and malicious. The presence alone doesn't mean something bad, but certain behaviors might.\n\nLooking at the winlog task types: there are ProcessCreate, ImageLoad, FileCreate, FileDeleteDetected, RegistryEvent, etc. These could be normal operations or indicators of suspicious activity. For example, creating files in temporary directories without a clear purpose could be malicious.\n\nI see multiple events where PowerShell is accessing the registry (Registry value set). That's not unusual for scripts that might need to modify system settings, but it's something to watch because attackers often use registry modifications for persistence or other purposes.\n\nThere are file creation and deletion events. Specifically, there's a temporary .ps1 file being created and then deleted quickly. This could be part of script execution where the file is written temporarily before running, which might indicate that some script was executed. If it's malicious, they might delete evidence, but in this case, since it's within a single batch, maybe it's not too concerning.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'powershell.exe & {}' in the command line, but I'm not sure what that signifies exactly. It could be part of a script execution or a legitimate process.\n\nThere are multiple instances where the same processes and file operations occur, which might indicate automated behavior, perhaps from a script or tool. The fact that the same patterns repeat several times suggests some kind of activity—could it be testing for vulnerabilities, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration?\n\nThe last event is 'conhost.exe' accessing the registry. Conhost is associated with console windows, so maybe this is part of a legitimate process, but again, could be used maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell processes performing file operations and registry changes, along with temporary script file creation\/deletion—these are red flags for potential malicious activity. The repetition and combination of these events make the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes show file creation\/deletion in temp directory, registry modifications, and repeated command patterns indicative of potentially malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed and executed. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities, so repeated access might indicate something suspicious. For example, there are events like ProcessCreate for powershell.exe and also command lines with \"& {}\" which seems unusual. This could potentially be an attempt to execute scripts or commands that aren't clearly visible.\n\nLooking further, I see several Registry value set tasks related to powershell.exe. Modifying the registry can allow persistence mechanisms, meaning attackers might be trying to maintain access to the system even after a restart. Additionally, there are file creation and deletion events for a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. This filename looks like it's part of a script policy test, but without knowing the content, it's hard to say if it's malicious. However, creating and then deleting such files quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe and cmd.exe. While these are common utilities, their execution in conjunction with powershell might be part of a larger script or command chain that's worth investigating. The command line for cmd.exe just has \"\/c\", which usually means it's waiting to execute another command.\n\nThere are also image load events where powershell loads various DLLs. This is normal, but the specific paths and the combination with other activities might warrant closer look.\n\nOverall, the batch shows repeated use of powershell with potentially suspicious command lines and activity around file creation\/deletion in temp directories, along with registry modifications. These behaviors could be indicative of malicious scripts trying to execute, establish persistence, or cover their tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with potentially suspicious command lines and activities such as registry modifications, file creation\/deletion in temp directories, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Powershell is often used by attackers because it has powerful scripting capabilities and can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The presence of so many powershell processes might indicate something suspicious, especially when combined with other actions like registry modifications and file creations.\n\nLooking closer, several events show that powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that include \"& { ... }\". This syntax suggests that the script is executing additional commands or scripts after the initial one. Specifically, there's a command line: \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". The Remove-Item cmdlet is used to delete files, and in this case, it's targeting a .zip file in the TEMP directory. If this script is running without clear justification, it could be part of an attempt to clean up evidence or remove malicious payloads.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value set events across different processes, including both powershell.exe and chrome.exe. While legitimate applications do modify the registry, repeated writes can sometimes be indicative of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access to a system. Additionally, the process accessed events on powershell.exe might suggest that other processes or scripts are interacting with it, possibly indicating privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is the file creation event in the user's AppData directory when running powershell.exe. This could be part of script execution where malicious scripts write to specific directories as a way to store configurations or evidence for later use.\n\nThe repeated Image loaded events for various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are normal for powershell, which relies on .NET components. However, the combination with other suspicious activities might still raise flags.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—multiple powershell executions, file deletions in TEMP, registry modifications, and script activity—it's reasonable to suspect that this batch of logs could indicate malicious behavior or at least potentially risky activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts, including deletion of files in TEMP directory, registry modifications, and loading of .NET components.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining each event individually to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog task: Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\n- File path: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll\n\nThis seems normal as PowerShell is loading a legitimate DLL file related to Windows Defender.\n\nSecond event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog task: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n- File path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1\n\nThis indicates that PowerShell is creating a temporary script file, which is typical for scripts executed in memory.\n\nThird event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog task: File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\n- File path: same as above\n\nHere, the system logs that a file was deleted. Since the file was created by PowerShell and deletions often happen after script execution, this might be part of normal operations.\n\nFourth event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog task: Pipe Created (rule: PipeEvent)\n\nThis is common for inter-process communication and not suspicious on its own.\n\nFifth to eleventh events:\nThese all involve powershell.exe executing Remove-Item commands targeting files in the TEMP directory. The command lines suggest deletion of specific ZIP files. Using a loop or multiple calls to remove items isn't unusual, but it's worth noting that they are deleting various files with names like tarefa_base.zip and estrutura_geral.zip.\n\nTwelfth event:\n- Process: chrome.exe\n- Winlog task: Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\n- File: None\n\nBrowser processes often interact with the registry for settings, so this is normal.\n\nThirteenth to fourteenth events:\nchrome.exe loading DLLs from Windows Defender, which is expected behavior.\n\nFifteenth event:\npowershell.exe accessing MpClient.dll, another legitimate Defender-related file.\n\nSixteenth event:\npowershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData directory. This might be for script initialization or configuration, but it's not inherently suspicious.\n\nSeventeenth to eighteenth events:\nRegistry value sets by powershell.exe and conhost.exe—could relate to configuration changes.\n\nNineteenth event:\nwhoami.exe is executed without any unusual command line arguments. This is a common system tool used to get user information, often used in scripts for legitimate purposes.\n\nTwentieth to twenty-third events:\nMore Remove-Item commands targeting text files (tarefa_base.txt) and others in TEMP. The use of -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore suggests that the deletions are being done without prompting and ignoring errors if the file doesn't exist, which is common in automated scripts to avoid issues.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: a lot of activity from powershell.exe deleting files in TEMP, creating temporary script files, accessing legitimate Defender DLLs, setting registry values, and running whoami. These are all normal operations that PowerShell often performs when executing scripts or tasks.\n\nHowever, one thing to consider is the volume of deletions across different file types (ZIP and TXT) in TEMP. While individual deletions aren't suspicious, a high number could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after some activity. But without additional context like timestamps or other events, it's hard to tell if this is part of a larger malicious process.\n\nAnother point is the use of -ErrorAction Ignore in the command lines. While not inherently malicious, attackers sometimes suppress error messages to avoid detection. However, legitimate scripts also do this to handle errors gracefully.\n\nThe creation and deletion of temporary script files are common practices for both benign and potentially malicious scripts, as they allow execution in memory without writing to disk, which can evade some antivirus detection.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: powershell.exe is a common target for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. However, it's also widely used legitimately. Without indicators of compromise (IoCs), like known malicious script hashes or domains, it's difficult to label this activity as suspicious.\n\nThe fact that whoami.exe was executed could be part of some legitimate user enumeration, but without more context, it doesn't raise red flags.\n\nIn summary, each individual event appears normal, and the overall pattern resembles a script or automated process using PowerShell to clean up temporary files and perform configuration changes. There are elements that could warrant closer inspection, especially if combined with other factors not present here, but based solely on these logs, there's no clear indication of malicious activity.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as not immediately suspicious, but it's always good to monitor for patterns or additional events that might provide more context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"not-suspicious\",\n  \"justification\": \"The activities involve normal operations of PowerShell and related processes, such as file creation, deletion, and registry interactions. The events resemble legitimate script execution and cleanup processes.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The command lines in these events show Remove-Item commands with specific file paths in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because deleting files from the temp folder isn't unusual, but when combined with other activities, it might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, which means it's loading various DLLs. This is normal for PowerShell to function, so that alone doesn't raise a red flag. However, the combination of these loads with the deletion commands could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence.\n\nThere are also FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events related to temporary files created by powershell.exe. The file names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 seem transient, but it's possible they were used for some malicious scripting before being deleted quickly.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe process running, which might be used to check user permissions or system information. This could be part of an attacker's lateral movement or reconnaissance.\n\nI also see events involving other processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe. Conhost is a legitimate Windows process, so that's probably not an issue on its own. Winlogbeat is likely part of the log collection setup, so unless it's involved in malicious activity, it's probably benign.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple deletions from TEMP using powershell.exe, creation and deletion of temporary files, image loads, registry changes, and a whoami command. These activities could be indicative of an attacker trying to remove logs or evidence, execute scripts, or gather system information.\n\nWhile some actions are normal, the frequency and combination might warrant further investigation.
