Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a process named ShellExperienceHost.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems normal since these are standard Windows processes and DLLs related to shell operations and URL handling.\n\nNext, svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svc host is known to run various services, so this isn't unusual unless it's accessing unexpected keys.\n\nThen there's an event with no process, task, or file—probably just noise.\n\nExplorer.EXE modifying the registry again is normal as it interacts with system settings.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries start appearing, creating processes and setting registry values. While some of these actions are typical for a browser, I notice multiple RegistryEvent tasks, which could indicate unusual activity. However, since Chrome is known to interact heavily with the registry for extensions and settings, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory—it seems like it's setting up logging, which isn't concerning unless there's more context.\n\nI also see multiple instances of chrome.exe performing Dns queries and loading system DLLs. These actions are common for web browsers accessing domains and using standard libraries.\n\nLooking at WmiPrvSE.exe creating a process with specific parameters—it's part of WMI and usually not malicious, but sometimes used by malware. The command line looks legitimate here, so probably fine.\n\nsvchost.exe instances running as LocalSystemNetworkRestricted and LocalServiceNetworkRestricted are normal for network-related services.\n\nThe services.exe logon event is standard Windows activity.\n\nMultiple chrome.exe processes setting registry values repeatedly might be a bit unusual but could also be due to plugin activities or updates. However, the frequency here seems high—eight events of RegistryEvent from Chrome. That's something to note but not necessarily red flags yet.\n\nThere are several NetworkConnect events from both Chrome and svchost.exe. This is expected for network usage but could indicate data exfiltration if combined with other signs.\n\nOverall, while there are some repetitive actions by Chrome and a few processes that catch the eye, nothing stands out as overtly malicious. The activities are consistent with normal system operations and common software behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, file operations, and network connections. There's no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies that would warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_193900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe performing tasks like setting registry values and creating pipes. These seem normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry and uses pipes for inter-process communication. Not a red flag here.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating files in its directory. This looks like it's part of the setup or configuration process for the log shipping tool, so that's expected behavior.\n\nThen there's an updater.exe running with some command-line arguments pointing to known GoogleUpdater paths and URLs. The command line seems legitimate, just doing updates as intended. No unusual flags or suspicious URLs here.\n\nAnother event is chrome.exe loading taskschd.dll from System32, which is a standard Windows file used by task scheduler. This is normal.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe starting with BthAvctpSvc is typical for running background services in Windows. It's a common process and not indicative of anything malicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, each event appears to be within the realm of normal operations for these processes. There's nothing out of place or unusual that would raise concern. So, I'd classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are typical and expected system activities such as process creation, file operations, and registry changes related to common applications like Chrome, updater.exe, and svchost.exe.
