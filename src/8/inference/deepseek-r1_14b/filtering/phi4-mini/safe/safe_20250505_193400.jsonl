{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_193400.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Let's look at each event.\n\nThe first event involves the Registry process being created. That seems normal because the registry is a common system component.\n\nNext, there are several events without a specific process name but with tasks like VsmPolicyEnablement and BootMenuPolicy. These also seem routine as they relate to system policies.\n\nThen, there's a LeapSecondDataUpdate task, which I know handles time adjustments, so thatâ€™s expected.\n\nThe fifth event is another Process Creation without any details, so it could be anything but might not indicate malicious activity on its own.\n\nThe sixth event is smss.exe being created. That process is legitimate and part of Windows, so no red flags there.\n\nThe remaining events are DirtyTransition, Summary2 (appearing twice), BatteryCountChange. These tasks don't raise any alarms either; they seem like normal system operations.\n\nPutting it all together, each event appears to be a standard part of the system's operation without any signs of unusual or malicious behavior. There's no indication of multiple processes being created abnormally, failed attempts, or other indicators that could suggest an attack. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system operations, including process creation and policy updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
