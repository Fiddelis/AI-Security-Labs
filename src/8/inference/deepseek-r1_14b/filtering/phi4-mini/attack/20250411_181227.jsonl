{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events where powershell.exe is being executed with some command lines. Looking at the command line details, it seems like they're creating scheduled tasks using New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask. The commands look similar but have different task names each time, like unidade_ativo, registro_geral, etc. The actions are all setting calc.exe to run on logon with high privileges for the Administrators group. This is a bit concerning because creating multiple scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon could be an attempt to maintain persistence or elevate privileges.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values, which is part of how scheduled tasks work, but it's worth noting that these actions can be indicators of malicious activity. There's also a process creation event for powershell.exe, which is normal, but in combination with the other activities, it might raise flags.\n\nI see some events where files are created and then deleted in the Temp directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. This temporary script file being created and immediately deleted could be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts can execute without being detected.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe creating pipes and accessing registry values, but those don't seem out of the ordinary unless there's something specific about how they're used in conjunction with other activities. However, given that most events are related to powershell.exe, which has a higher potential for misuse, I'm more focused on those.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks created by powershell.exe, each targeting calc.exe at logon, the use of high privileges, temporary script creation and deletion, and several process and registry access events. These could be signs of an attempt to establish persistence or perform malicious activities under the guise of legitimate operations.\n\nSo, considering the combination of creating multiple elevated scheduled tasks, file handling in Temp, and other system accesses, this batch of logs does seem suspicious enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events presents several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing commands to create scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`. Each task is configured to run `calc.exe` at logon with elevated privileges for the Administrators group. This behavior could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or elevate system access.\n\n2. **File Handling**: A temporary script file, `__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`, is created and then deleted in the Temp directory. Such actions may suggest efforts to bypass security policies or test script execution capabilities without detection.\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access**: Events show powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values, which are common activities for task creation but can also be indicators of malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Process Creation and Pipe Events**: Powershell.exe is created multiple times, and chrome.exe creates pipes. While the latter isn't unusual on its own, combined with other activities, it could warrant closer scrutiny.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of creating elevated scheduled tasks, temporary file handling, and system access events suggests potential malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these activities and ensure system security."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice there are two instances where PowerShell is being used with specific commands. The command lines look suspicious because they're setting up scheduled tasks that execute calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges. This could be a sign of malicious activity since calc.exe is typically harmless on its own but might be used as part of a payload delivery.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome does make some registry changes during normal operation, repeated writes without a clear reason might indicate tampering or attempts to persistence.\n\nThen, several events show remote command execution tasks. These could be signs of unauthorized access or command-and-control activities where an attacker is executing commands on the system.\n\nLooking at svchost.exe modifying the registry and creating files in Task directories is concerning because svchost is a legitimate process but often exploited by malware to hide malicious activities. The creation of new task files without known purpose raises flags.\n\nThere's also an instance of conhost.exe setting registry values, which is unusual as it's typically related to console hosting but might be used for command execution in the background.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creations and modifications by various processes like powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. While some could be normal, others, especially those with unknown paths or purposes, might indicate data exfiltration or setting up backdoors.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to form a pattern of potential malicious activity, including persistence mechanisms, unauthorized process execution, and possible data handling by malicious scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe, repeated registry modifications, remote command executions, and file creations that could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events and trying to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task is a registry value set. This seems normal because Chrome often modifies system settings, like creating or updating registry keys for extensions, themes, or updates. I don't see any red flags here since these activities are typical for a web browser.\n\nNext, there's an event where 'winlogbeat.exe' created a new file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect and send logs, so it makes sense that it creates configuration files. This doesn't raise any concerns as it's part of its normal operation.\n\nThen, there's a process named 'powershell.exe' creating a file called 'objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, which makes this event more interesting. However, in this case, the file path seems benignâ€”it's located in the Downloads folder of the user 'fiddelis'. Without additional context, like unusual file names or paths, or multiple such events, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking at all these events together: most are normal activities from Chrome and log collection tools. The only slightly concerning event is the PowerShell creating a file, but without more information, it doesn't seem significant enough on its own. So overall, I don't think this batch indicates any malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal activities such as Chrome modifying registry values, Winlogbeat creating configuration files, and a PowerShell process creating a file in the Downloads folder. These are typical user actions and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
