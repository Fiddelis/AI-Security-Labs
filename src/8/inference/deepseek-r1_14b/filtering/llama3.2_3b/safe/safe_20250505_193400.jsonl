Each line is a JSON object representing an event from the Windows event log. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLet me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event has \"task\":\"DirtyBootShutdown\". That sounds like it's related to system shutdown, maybe under dirty conditions where the OS wasn't properly closed down.\n2. Next is \"task\":\"BootMenuPolicy\". This might be about policies set during boot time, perhaps configurations applied when the system starts up.\n3. Then there's \"task\":\"BootType\", which could indicate whether it's a cold boot or a resume from hibernation.\n4. \"UserInputTime\" probably refers to user login times, tracking when users accessed the system.\n5. The next two events have \"None\", which I guess means no specific task or activity was logged during those events.\n6. Then there's \"Process Creation\" for an event where the process name is \"smss.exe\". SMSS.EXE is a known Windows process related to session management, so this seems normal as part of system initialization.\n7. The following events are again \"None\", which might just be noise or low-priority logs.\n8. There's another \"Process Creation\" without a specific process name, which could be typical during startup.\n9. Lastly, there are multiple entries with \"Summary2\" and \"BatteryCountChange\". Summary2 might summarize system performance metrics, and BatteryCountChange likely relates to battery status updates.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these events look like standard system initialization and runtime logs. They include tasks like booting up, process creation (even though one was smss.exe which is normal), user input times, battery updates, etc. None of them seem out of the ordinary for a typical Windows system in operation.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unexpected processes, no failed login attempts, nothing indicating unauthorized access or suspicious file operations. The events are all within expected parameters for a system's normal operation.\n\nThe confidence level is pretty high that this batch isn't interesting because each event aligns with standard system behaviors. There's no indication of unusual spikes in activity, missing processes, or any red flags associated with known attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system initialization and runtime logs, including process creation, boot tasks, user input tracking, and battery updates. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
