{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event shows.\n\nThe first event is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. That seems normal since it's likely the log shipping agent setting up files.\n\nNext, mmc.exe making a registry change. MMC is a common management tool, and registry edits aren't unusual unless they're out of place. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple events from powershell.exe. The first one is just starting up. Then loading clrjit.dll, which is part of the .NET framework, so that's expected.\n\nThe next few lines show file creations in different locations: AppData and Downloads. Creating files in these areas with .ps1 extensionsâ€”those are PowerShell scripts. That could be a red flag because malicious actors often use PowerShell for scripting attacks.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various DLLs which might be normal but sometimes attackers load malicious modules or legitimate ones in a way that seems excessive.\n\nThe last few events also show file creations and script policy tests. The filenames like __PSScriptPolicyTest* suggest PowerShell is checking its execution policies, which could indicate an attempt to run scripts, possibly malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe with multiple file creations and script-related activities might be indicative of lateral movement or setting up persistence. This batch shows unusual activity that needs closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events from powershell.exe showing file creation and image loading activities, particularly creating .ps1 files in user directories, which could indicate malicious scripting activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
