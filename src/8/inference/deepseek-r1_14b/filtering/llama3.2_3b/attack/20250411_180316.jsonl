My job is to figure out if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first line shows RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That seems normal because Runtime Broker handles things like user account control, so that might be standard activity. Not too worried there.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration but can also be abused by attackers. I'll keep an eye on how many times it appears and what commands are run.\n\nThen there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because calculator typically doesn't load such DLLs. Maybe it's a red flag or just some legitimate operation I'm not aware of.\n\nMoving on, svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a standard process for hosting services, so that activity might be normal unless it's accessing unusual areas.\n\nCalculator.exe also loading urlmon.dll. That repetition with calc.exe makes me think there's something more here—maybe malicious scripts or injected modules?\n\nMultiple entries show powershell.exe being accessed and setting registry values. The frequency is concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and persistence.\n\nWhoami.exe is run from the command line. Using whoami could be part of legitimate user enumeration, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might indicate recon or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe command that deletes notepad.exe using wmic. Deleting system files can be malicious, especially if done without reason. That's definitely a red flag.\n\nAnother cmd.exe copies sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. SETHC is related to secure attention sequences; replacing it could allow an attacker to regain access after a lockdown.\n\nThen, there are commands deleting scheduled tasks with schtasks. Deleting tasks can be part of cleaning up traces or disrupting system functions, which is another bad sign.\n\nMultiple instances of cmd.exe creating processes with empty command lines might indicate attempts to hide activity or execute malicious code without logging much.\n\nConhost.exe and whoami.exe are used again. Conhost is often involved in attacks where attackers try to access protected resources, so combined with other activities, it's worrying.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows several high-risk behaviors like deleting system files, modifying binaries related to secure functions, using PowerShell extensively, and employing command-line tools for tasks that don't seem legitimate. These actions could be part of an attack chain aiming to establish persistence or escalate privileges. While some events might be innocent, the cluster around malicious activities suggests the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as deletion of system files, manipulation of secure binaries, and extensive use of PowerShell, which are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved: there are multiple instances of cmd.exe and powershell.exe running with different command lines. Powershell is known for being used in both legitimate scripts and malicious activities because it has so much power on a system. So any suspicious activity here could be a red flag.\n\nI notice that several events involve registry changes. Registry modifications can indicate tampering with system settings, which might be part of persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations to facilitate malicious activities. But sometimes, even legitimate scripts make registry changes, so I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThere are also multiple instances where files are being created by powershell.exe. The paths mentioned like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\" might be temporary locations where scripts could store malicious files or create new ones for execution. Temporary files can be a sign of script activity, but again, not always malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some are obfuscated or have complex paths. For example, one powershell.exe call is using an if statement to check the existence of certain .bat files and exit based on that. This might be part of a script trying to ensure it runs only under specific conditions, which could indicate evasion techniques.\n\nThe repeated use of \"powershell.exe & {if (Test-Path...}\" in the command lines stands out. This pattern suggests multiple attempts to run scripts with conditional checks, possibly indicating a testing phase or an attempt to avoid detection by ensuring the script only runs when certain files are present.\n\nAdditionally, there are process creation and image load events for powershell.exe, which is normal, but coupled with the other activities, it raises suspicion. The fact that some processes don't have associated file paths makes me think they might be part of a larger chain where files aren't directly referenced in each event.\n\nConsidering all these points together: registry modifications, temporary file creation, repeated command patterns checking for specific files, and multiple powershell instances with potentially malicious intent indicators. While some activities could be legitimate, the combination seems concerning enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with potential indicators of malicious activity such as registry modifications and file creation in temporary directories.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events are related to PowerShell executions. For example, the command lines show powershell.exe being used with various script blocks. This is common in legitimate scripts but can also be a red flag for malicious activity since attackers often use PowerShell for its scripting capabilities and evasion techniques.\n\nLooking at the tasks in the winlog field, I see events like 'Provider Lifecycle', 'Engine Lifecycle', and file operations such as creation and deletion. The file paths mentioned are a bit unusual with long nested directory structures ending with \"script.bat\" or \".ps1\". This could indicate script generation or execution, which might be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is deleted: 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. While this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, combined with the other events, it raises some concerns about potential tampering or cleanup activities after a breach.\n\nAnother point to note is the use of different command lines and multiple checks for existing files before exiting. For example, 'if (Test-Path ...) {exit 0} else {exit 1}}' suggests that scripts are checking if certain files exist. This kind of behavior can be part of legitimate scripting but might also be used by attackers to ensure their malicious scripts run only once or after confirming the presence of specific conditions.\n\nI also see references to various system directories and components, like 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData' and Windows Defender files. While some are standard, others might be attempts to access sensitive areas or hide malicious activities.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell executions creating, accessing, and deleting files in unusual paths. This pattern could indicate script execution for both legitimate and potentially malicious purposes. However, without more context on what these scripts are doing, it's hard to say definitively. The high volume of related events does raise a red flag, especially since attackers often use such techniques.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because the behavior doesn't align with typical user activities. The combination of multiple script executions, file operations in odd locations, and deletion events suggests possible malicious intent or at least suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of JSONL events exhibits characteristics that merit attention from a cybersecurity standpoint:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions**: Several events involve powershell.exe executing scripts, often a tactic for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.\n\n2. **Unusual File Operations**: The creation, access, and deletion of files in non-standard paths (e.g., \"script.bat\", \".ps1\") could indicate script generation or execution, potentially malicious.\n\n3. **File Deletion Event**: An event logging a file deletion might suggest efforts to cover tracks post-breach or as part of payload execution.\n\n4. **Conditional Script Checks**: Scripts checking for existing files before proceeding can be legitimate but may also signal malicious activities ensuring scripts run only once or under specific conditions.\n\n5. **Access to Sensitive Areas**: References to user directories and Windows Defender components raise concerns about potential access to sensitive areas or evasion techniques.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the events could be part of legitimate scripting, the combination of PowerShell use, file operations in unusual paths, and deletion activities suggests possible malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these scripts and their impact on system security."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let's see what they're all about. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 19 entries here. I need to look at the entire batch together rather than each individual event.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be legitimate for admins or scripters, but it's also commonly used in attacks because it has built-in features for system manipulation. So multiple powershell processes could be a red flag, especially if they're doing things that seem suspicious.\n\nLooking closer at the details:\n- Several entries have 'Process Create' tasks, indicating new processes were started. For example, whoami.exe and cmd.exe are also there. Sometimes attackers use these to check user information or execute commands.\n- There are multiple 'File created', 'Image loaded', and 'File Delete logged' events. Creating files and loading images can be part of malicious activities like dropping payloads or creating temporary files for scripts.\n- The command lines in some powershell.exe entries look complex with if statements checking for file existence. This could be an attempt to see if certain files are present, possibly as part of a payload deployment or verification step. It's unusual for legitimate scripts to check for specific files in such a way unless they're trying to ensure they can proceed without being detected.\n\nAnother point is the repetition. There are multiple similar powershell.exe processes with different command lines that all seem to involve checking if certain files exist and exiting based on their presence. This pattern suggests some automated script running, which could be malicious.\n\nAlso, I see that there's an attempt to delete a file: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\". Deleting scripts might indicate trying to remove evidence or prevent detection by security tools.\n\nLooking at the other processes like whoami.exe and cmd.exe being created with specific command lines could be part of reconnaissance, checking user information or executing commands that are harder to track.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell instances with file checks, deletions, and other process creations. This combination is concerning because it shows behavior consistent with malicious activity—like persistence mechanisms, file manipulation, and process injection. The repeated use of powershell with such command lines increases the suspicion level.\n\nI'm not seeing any obvious legitimate reasons for this pattern. Legitimate scripts usually don't delete their own files or check for specific file existence in this manner across multiple processes. So overall, while I can't be 100% certain without more context, the indicators point towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\nAfter analyzing the provided system log entries, here's a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Event Overview**: The logs contain 19 events, primarily involving 'powershell.exe', 'whoami.exe', and 'cmd.exe'.\n\n2. **Frequency of Powershell Use**: Notably, 'powershell.exe' appears frequently, suggesting possible malicious activity due to its common use in attacks.\n\n3. **Process Creation**: Several entries show 'Process Create' tasks for 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe'. These can be used for system reconnaissance or execution of commands.\n\n4. **File Operations**: There are events indicating file creation, image loading, and file deletion. The deleted file is \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ndvo4v2z.ssp.ps1\", which might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\n5. **Command-Line Analysis**: Powershell command lines include complex checks for specific files' existence, possibly part of payload deployment verification.\n\n6. **Repetitive Behavior**: Multiple similar powershell processes with varied command lines checking file presence suggest automated script execution, a common tactic in attacks.\n\n7. **Suspicious Indicators**: The combination of process creation, file manipulation, and repetitive powershell usage points to potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or payload delivery.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pattern observed—multiple powershell instances with file checks, deletions, and other process creations—is indicative of possible malicious behavior. While not conclusive without additional context, the indicators strongly suggest an attack vector using these processes for system compromise or data exfiltration.\n\n**Answer:** The batch shows potential malicious activity involving multiple powershell.exe processes, file manipulations, and other suspicious actions, suggesting a cybersecurity threat."}

Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process being created. That seems normal; it's often used to check user information. Not sure if that's malicious yet.\n\nNext, two entries show 'powershell.exe' being accessed and created. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and for malicious activities. So I should pay attention here. The command lines in some events are a bit long and contain paths with backslashes. They're using Test-Path to check if certain files exist, which could be part of a script checking for file presence before proceeding.\n\nLooking at the file events: there's a file being created and then immediately deleted by PowerShell. That behavior can be suspicious because it might indicate an attempt to hide something or test permissions without leaving traces. Also, creating temporary scripts like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1' is unusual unless it's part of some automated process.\n\nI notice multiple events where PowerShell loads different .dll files and interacts with various system components. While this isn't necessarily bad on its own, the combination of repeated PowerShell activity, file operations, and checks for specific file paths could be indicative of malicious behavior such as testing for file existence to ensure persistence mechanisms are in place or attempting to execute code without proper authorization.\n\nThe fact that these events all relate to PowerShell activities over a period suggests potential scripting or automation. The use of multiple ImageLoad tasks and Provider Lifecycle events might indicate that the script is loading modules or components, which could be part of malicious payload execution.\n\nTaking into account the frequency and nature of these events, especially the file creation and deletion, along with the repeated checks using Test-Path, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting. These actions don't clearly indicate malicious intent on their own, but together they raise enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances are performing file system checks and operations, including creating and deleting temporary files, which may indicate suspicious activity such as scripting or testing permissions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple events involving powershell.exe being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific .ps1 files. The paths in these command lines vary but all seem to be checking for \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" across different directories. That immediately raises a red flag because Get-Keystrokes is often used for keylogging, which is malicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where whoami.exe is run. While whoami is generally benign and used to get user information, the fact that it's being executed multiple times alongside powershell scripts might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or gather more system info.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, I see a mix of Process Create, Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image Load, File Create, and others. The File Create event in one instance points to a temporary .ps1 file, which could be part of script execution or testing permissions.\n\nThe repeated attempts to access different paths for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggest an external script is trying multiple locations to see if the malicious payload exists. This could be part of setting up persistence or ensuring that the script can run without being detected.\n\nThere are also several Process Access and Image Load events related to powershell.exe, which might indicate monitoring or injection attempts. The loading of mscoree.dll and clr.dll is normal for PowerShell but combined with other activities could imply something more malicious.\n\nI don't see any direct evidence of suspicious files being created or executed beyond the script checks and temporary file creation. However, the persistence in checking multiple paths and creating a temp script file is concerning. It suggests someone is trying to ensure their malicious script is present or can be run later.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not look suspicious, the combination—especially the repeated attempts to access and check for a known keylogging script across various directories and the creation of a temporary PowerShell script—points towards potential malicious activity. This makes the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show attempts to execute powershell.exe with command lines checking for 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' across various directories, which is often used for keylogging.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and decide if the entire set is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are events from svchost.exe and chrome.exe indicating network connections. These could be normal since svchost is a common system process and Chrome handles networking too. But then I see multiple entries from powershell.exe with various tasks like ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad.\n\nThe command line in some of the later events shows \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse ...}\" which seems suspicious. LS and get-childitem are used for directory listing, but when chained together and without a clear purpose, it might indicate reconnaissance or data gathering. Especially since it's repeated several times across multiple events.\n\nAdditionally, powershell.exe is setting registry values and loading images, which can be part of legitimate scripts but also often used in malicious activities like persistence mechanisms. There's also a file created by powershell: 'estrutura_secundario.txt' in the Downloads folder, which doesn't seem standard. Legitimate scripts usually don't create files with such names unless instructed.\n\nAnother point is that winlogbeat.exe creates a config file; that seems normal for log shipping tools, so probably not an issue.\n\nConsidering all together, the repeated powershell commands and registry modifications suggest potential malicious activity.
