{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: winlogbeat.exe creating files and powershell.exe accessing processes. These seem normal as part of log management and system monitoring.\n\nThen there's an ssh.exe making a network connection. SSH is common for remote access, but without context on usage patterns, it's hard to say. However, multiple instances might raise flags, but here it's just one.\n\nI notice powershell.exe being launched multiple times with different command lines. The process creations and image loads are typical when running PowerShell scripts. Also, there are several entries about Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle for PowerShell—these are standard events when the script runs.\n\nThe file created by winlogbeat seems to be part of its setup, so that's not suspicious on its own.\n\nHowever, I do see powershell.exe creating a temporary PS1 file, then deleting it. This is concerning because it might indicate a malicious script trying to avoid detection. The creation and deletion of the temp file could be an attempt to execute code without leaving a trace.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs when running PowerShell, which is expected. But combined with the file handling, it raises questions about what the script was doing.\n\nWhile some events individually aren't suspicious, the combination—especially the temporary file behavior—could indicate malicious activity. So overall, I'm leaning towards this being interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell processes accessing system files and network connections, including creation and deletion of a temporary script file which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event.\n\nThe first line is a JSON object indicating that svchost.exe created a file in the path C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\XboxLive. The second line shows another event where svchost.exe creates AuthStateCache.dat in the same directory but with an extra filename.\n\nI know svchost.exe is a common system process used by various services, including Windows updates and third-party applications like Xbox Live. It's not inherently malicious, but it can be abused by malware.\n\nLooking at the file paths: both are under the XboxLive folder. The first event creates the main directory, and the second creates a specific cache file. These actions seem normal for an Xbox-related process trying to initialize or update its configuration. Since svchost.exe is known to handle system services and can execute tasks on behalf of other applications, this activity isn't unusual.\n\nI should also consider if there's any indication of malicious behavior here. The files are in standard locations related to user profiles and application data. There's no sign of writes to unexpected places or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers can misuse svchost.exe for persistence or lateral movement. But without more context like repeated failures, unusual times, or other suspicious activities across the batch, I don't see enough evidence here to raise concerns.\n\nSo overall, these events look legitimate and related to Xbox Live operations. Therefore, they probably aren't interesting from a security standpoint unless there's additional data suggesting otherwise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show svchost.exe creating files under the XboxLive directory, which is normal for legitimate system processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
