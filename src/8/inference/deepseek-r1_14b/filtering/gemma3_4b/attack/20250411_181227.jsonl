{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few events, they all involve powershell.exe being executed with some command line arguments. The command lines look like they're creating scheduled tasks using PowerShell's New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask commands. Each time, it's trying to execute calc.exe at logon as a user in the Administrators group with highest privileges. That seems suspicious because scheduling a task that runs at logon with admin rights could be a way for malware to persist across reboots.\n\nThe events also mention 'Provider Lifecycle' in the winlog field. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it sounds like it's related to how tasks are being registered or unregistered, which fits with creating scheduled tasks.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is just listed by name without command line info. But since it's paired with 'Process Create' and other task events, it probably relates to the same activity.\n\nLooking further down, I see that chrome.exe has some pipe created and registry events, but those don't seem as concerning on their own. The powershell.exe entries continue with image load events, which show that PowerShell is loading various .NET libraries. That makes sense because PowerShell uses .NET under the hood.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks at logon with admin privileges. This behavior stands out because attackers often use legitimate tools like PowerShell to create persistence mechanisms. The repeated attempts and different task names (like unidade_ativo, registro_geral) suggest a possible attempt to create multiple tasks or test different ways to persist.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the pattern of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is a common tactic in attacks for persistence. Even though each individual command might not be definitively malicious on its own, the volume and nature of these commands over several events raise red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple events involve `powershell.exe`, which is often used by attackers for its scripting capabilities and persistence features.\n\n2. **Analyze Command-Line Arguments:**\n   - The command lines show the creation of scheduled tasks using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` and `Register-ScheduledTask`.\n   - These tasks execute `calc.exe` at logon with Administrator privileges, a red flag for potential persistence mechanisms.\n\n3. **Note Task Creation Frequency:**\n   - Several events attempt to create different tasks (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `registro_geral`). This could indicate an attacker testing multiple methods or attempting to bypass restrictions.\n\n4. **Consider Privilege Escalation:**\n   - Running tasks with Administrator privileges at logon is a common technique for attackers to maintain elevated access on the system.\n\n5. **Evaluate Context of Other Events:**\n   - While `chrome.exe` has some events, they don't indicate malicious activity. The focus remains on `powershell.exe`.\n\n6. **Assess Image Load Events:**\n   - These are normal for PowerShell's operation but add context to the process activities and shouldn't raise concerns on their own.\n\n7. **Synthesize Findings:**\n   - The combination of multiple scheduled task creations with elevated privileges suggests a potential attack vector, aligning with common adversary tactics.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe batch of logs indicates suspicious activity likely related to an attacker establishing persistence using PowerShell. The high confidence is due to the specific and repeated use of `powershell.exe` for creating tasks at logon with admin rights, a known indicator of malicious behavior."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The first few events show ImageLoad and FileCreate\/Delete related to temporary files. That might not be suspicious on its own, but the fact that a script is being created and then deleted could indicate something's up.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in one of the events where powershell.exe is executing a script that creates a scheduled task. The action for this task is calc.exe, which seems benign because it's a calculator application. However, the trigger is set to AtLogon and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. This could allow the script to run at system level when the user logs on, which might be a way to maintain persistence. But I'm not sure if this is malicious because sometimes scripts do legitimate things at logon.\n\nThen there are several events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, multiple registry writes in quick succession could be suspicious if they're part of a larger campaign or attempting to change system configurations.\n\nThe latter part of the logs shows many events where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" This seems concerning because it indicates an attempt to execute commands remotely. Without knowing the source, this could be signs of remote execution attacks or command-line injections, which are common in cyber-attacks.\n\nPutting all this together: powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with system-level privileges, chrome.exe modifying registry entries multiple times, and numerous remote command executions. These activities don't directly point to a confirmed attack but show behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The confidence level is around 0.7 because while each event individually might not be conclusive, the combination suggests potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities including PowerShell executing commands to create scheduled tasks with system-level privileges, multiple registry modifications by Chrome.exe, and numerous remote command executions. These could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because WmiPrvSE is a legitimate Windows process for WMI services, and taskschd is the task scheduler. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. SvcHost is a common host process for various Windows services. Registry writes can be normal during operation, but too many in quick succession might be suspicious, especially if they're not related to known services. However, the other events don't immediately indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event by svchost.exe for a task named \"unidade_comum\". That translates to \"common unit\" which doesn't seem harmful, but I'm not entirely sure about that name's context. Still, without more info, it might be benign.\n\nThen there are two events where the process is None with an Execute Remote Command task. This could mean something executed without a parent process, which might be suspicious. Malware often runs without a parent to avoid detection or uses tools like powershell for execution. But I need to see if these are isolated or part of a pattern.\n\nPowershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values is notable because it's commonly used by attackers. The paths created in the user's AppData and Downloads folders don't seem inherently bad, but combined with other activities, they could be indicators of script execution. However, legitimate admins might also use powershell here, so it's context-dependent.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values is interesting because conhost is typically associated with command-line tools or terminal services. Unusual activity here could indicate a process running in an unexpected way, possibly as part of malicious scripts or tools.\n\nChrome.exe loading various DLLs and querying DNS are normal activities for a browser. However, the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe might be worth looking into. Could it be related to extensions or plugins that aren't behaving properly? Or maybe something more sinister like a drive-by download?\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating files in its own directory is expected if it's managing configuration or logs. But if this process isn't supposed to write there, or the files are unexpected, it could be part of log tampering. However, without knowing the specifics of how winlogbeat operates, I'm cautious but not certain.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows a variety of normal and some potentially suspicious activities. The repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and chrome.exe could be part of legitimate operations or signs of malicious behavior. The execute remote command tasks without parent processes are concerning. While each event might not individually raise red flags, the combination suggests possible investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially suspicious activities such as repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, file creations by powershell.exe in user directories, and execute remote command tasks with no parent process.
