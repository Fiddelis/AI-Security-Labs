{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's something to note. The next event mentions ssh.exe and a network connection. SSH can be part of normal operations, but an unexpected connection could be suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads different images like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. These might be legitimate parts of PowerShell's operation, but sometimes attackers use custom modules or load malicious libraries.\n\nI see several \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks from powershell.exe, which might just be normal initialization processes. However, the frequency could indicate something if it's out of the ordinary.\n\nThe event where a file is deleted by powershell.exe caught my attention. Deleting files can be part of cleaning up after malicious activity, so that's a red flag. The path mentioned looks like it's related to script policy testing, which might be normal, but combined with other events could raise concerns.\n\nThere's also an event about a pipe being created. Pipes are often used for communication between processes, but in the context of PowerShell, they can be used for command execution or lateral movement.\n\nThe last event is from winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which seems benign as it's likely part of log shipping or monitoring setup.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple powershell.exe events with file deletions and pipe creations might indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated use of PowerShell could be an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute commands. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because there are several indicators that could point to something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events including file deletions and pipe creations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
