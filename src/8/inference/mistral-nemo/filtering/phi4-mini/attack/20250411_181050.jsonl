The presence of certutil.exe is notable because it was used to encode\/decode files, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe for execution tasks is unusual and may suggest script-based or command-line based attacks. There are also several registry value set events involving chrome.exe, which could indicate attempts at persistence. Finally, there are multiple network connect events by chrome.exe, potentially indicating data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
