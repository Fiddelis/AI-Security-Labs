Check if the Microsoft Office updates are running or if any repairs were recently performed.\n2. Verify the integrity of your Office installation by running the built-in repair tool (` Programs and Features > Microsoft Office > Change > Quick Repair`).\n3. For winlogbeat, check if there's an error in the configuration file or if it's being updated properly. You might need to review or reset its configurations.\n4.
