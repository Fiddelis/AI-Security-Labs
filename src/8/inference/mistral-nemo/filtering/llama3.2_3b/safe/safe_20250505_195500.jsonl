If not, or if it's unwanted, consider removing it.\n- Monitor for any unusual behavior or performance issues related to the files being created.\n- Consider reaching out to your office administrator or Microsoft support if you're unsure about these events or if they're causing problems."}

It's creating JSON files (.js) that contain UI strings for different languages. For example:\n   - `en-us-ui-strings.json`: English (United States)\n   - `de-de-ui-strings.json`: German (Germany)\n   - `es-es-ui-strings.json`: Spanish (Spain)\n3.

The process is also creating SVG and icon files for Microsoft Fluent UI.\n\nHere's why this might be happening:\n\n- **Offline Files**: When you work with Office documents that have features like 'co-authoring' or 'real-time collaboration', Office creates offline files to manage the shared resources efficiently.\n- **Language Packs**: If you've enabled language packs or multilingual support in Office, it could be creating these offline files for UI strings in different languages.\n\nIf you're seeing a lot of file creation activities and it's causing performance issues on your system, you might want to:\n\n1. Check if there are any active collaboration features enabled in Office.\n2. Review your language pack settings.\n3. Consider disabling multilingual support or changing the supported languages if they're not needed.\n\nTo verify if these files are causing any issues, you could try renaming or deleting a few of them (after taking a backup) to see if it affects Office performance or functionality.
