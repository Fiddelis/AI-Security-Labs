The sequence started with 'whoami.exe', followed by 'cmd.exe' which used 'certutil.exe' to encode an executable file and save it as a temporary file. Then, the encoded file was decoded using another instance of 'certutil.exe'. After that, 'rundll32.exe' was executed to perform an unknown task related to PatchSdbTask. Following this sequence, various instances of 'powershell.exe' were executed, with one instance creating a new file in the Downloads folder ('componente_auxiliar.txt'). Finally, multiple instances of 'chrome.exe' were executed and performed registry operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
