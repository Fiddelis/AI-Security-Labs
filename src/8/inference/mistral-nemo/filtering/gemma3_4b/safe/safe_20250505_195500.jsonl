The sheer number of these files being created might suggest an issue with how the process is handling its caching, possibly leading to excessive resource usage if it continues unchecked.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n- **Monitor Resource Usage**: Keep an eye on your system's CPU and RAM usage to ensure this process isn't causing any performance issues.\n- **Check for Updates**: Make sure your Microsoft Office software is up-to-date. Buggy or outdated software can sometimes cause unexpected behavior like this.\n- **Consider Disabling 'Ideas' & 'Editor' Features**: If these features are enabled in your Office applications, you might want to disable them temporarily to see if that stops the excessive file creation.
