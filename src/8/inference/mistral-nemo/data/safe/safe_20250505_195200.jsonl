This behavior could indicate a few things:\n\n1. **Corrupted Software**: The software associated with SDXHelper.exe might be corrupted or malfunctioning, causing it to create and delete these files excessively.\n\n2. **Virus or Malware**: The process could be caused by malware that's attempting to access or manipulate files on your system. However, given the nature of the files (they seem to be related to Office and AI), it might not be a typical virus but possibly a targeted attack or exploit.\n\n3. **Background Task Gone Awry**: It could be a background task or process that's running amok due to a configuration issue or bug.\n\nTo address this, you should:\n\n1. **Scan for Malware**: Run a full system scan using reputable antivirus software to rule out any malicious activity.\n\n2. **Update Software**: Ensure that all your software, especially Office and related tools, are up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n\n3. **Check Task Manager**: Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to see if there's anything unusual running in the background. If you find something unfamiliar or suspicious, consider ending the task.\n\n4. **Monitor File Activity**: Keep an eye on file creation and deletion activity using tools like Process Monitor from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite to identify any abnormal behavior.\n\n5. **Reset Software**: If the issue is with a specific software, try resetting it or reinstalling it after backing up your data."}

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided logs, it seems like there's an issue with Microsoft Office creating and recreating multiple instances of the \"officeaicopilot-strings.min.js\" file in the Offline Files folder. Here are a few things you might want to check or consider:\n\n1. **Antivirus Software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with certain files or processes. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus software to see if that's causing the issue.\n\n2. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the user or application running Microsoft Office has the appropriate permissions to create and modify files in the Offline Files folder.\n\n3. **Office Add-ins\/Extensions**: If you have any add-ins or extensions enabled in Microsoft Office, try disabling them temporarily to see if they're causing the issue.\n\n4. **Office Updates**: Make sure your Microsoft Office is up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. You can check for updates through the built-in update feature in Office.\n\n5. **Third-Party Software**: If you have any third-party software integrated with Microsoft Office, try disabling or removing them temporarily to see if they're causing the problem.\n\n6. **Office Repair**: Running the Office repair tool could help resolve this issue. You can find this option by opening the \"Programs and Features\" control panel in Windows, clicking on \"Microsoft Office\", then \"Change\".\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it might be helpful to reach out to Microsoft Support or post your issue on official Microsoft forums for further assistance."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided JSON-like structure, it seems that multiple files related to Microsoft Office and AI Copilot are being created or updated by a process named \"SDXHelper.exe\". Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n1. **Process Name**: SDXHelper.exe\n   - This is likely a process associated with Microsoft Office or another Microsoft product.\n\n2. **File Patterns**: officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js\n   - These files appear to be JavaScript files, possibly containing language strings for the AI Copilot feature in Microsoft Office.\n   - The `<hash>` part seems to represent a unique identifier or version number for each file.\n\n3. **File Location**: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf660747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\n   - This is a typical location for temporary or cached files used by Microsoft Office applications.\n\n4. **Task**: File created (rule: FileCreate)\n   - The action being performed on these files is creation, suggesting that the AI Copilot feature might be updating its language resources or initializing them.\n\nSince these events are related to a legitimate Microsoft process and the files are located in expected paths for such temporary\/cached data, it's likely that this activity is normal and not indicative of any security threat. However, if you notice an unusually high number of these files being created or if the process behaves unexpectedly, it might be worth investigating further.\n\nAs always, it's a good practice to keep your software up-to-date and monitor its behavior to ensure it runs smoothly and securely."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the logs you've provided, here's what's happening:\n\n1. **Process Involved**: The process involved is `SDXHelper.exe`. This is likely a component of Microsoft Office or related software.\n\n2. **Task**: The task being performed by this process is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". In other words, the SDXHelper process is creating files.\n\n3. **Files Created**: It's creating several JavaScript (.js) files in the following directories:\n\n   - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n   - `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`\n\n   These files are likely related to the Office Scripts feature introduced in Microsoft 365, which allows users to automate tasks using JavaScript.\n\n4. **File Names**: The filenames seem to be hashes or versioning numbers (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_d4e700e1156c67b27923e16490b7d460.js`), suggesting that these are different versions of the same script or resource.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that Microsoft Office is updating some JavaScript files related to Office Scripts on your system. This is likely a normal process and not indicative of any issue or malware. However, if you're concerned about the legitimacy of these files, you can always check them with your antivirus software or Microsoft's official support channels."}
