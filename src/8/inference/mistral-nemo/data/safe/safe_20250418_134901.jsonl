{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134901.jsonl","analysis":"Based on the provided data, here's a summary of events and processes observed:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Installation & Execution:**\n   - `winlogbeat.exe` was executed.\n   - It created a new file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`.\n\n2. **System Processes:**\n   - Several `svchost.exe` processes were active, with multiple registry events (set, added\/deleted):\n     ```\n     Registry value set\n     Registry object added or deleted\n     Registry value set\n     Registry value set\n     Registry value set\n     Registry value set\n     Registry value set\n     ```\n\n3. **Browser Activity:**\n   - `chrome.exe` made numerous DNS queries and registry value changes:\n     ```\n     Dns query\n     Registry value set (multiple instances)\n     ```\n   This could indicate background activities or extensions running on the browser.\n\n4. **Other Notable Events:**\n   - `notepad.exe` loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n   - `Calculator.exe` made a single registry change.\n   - `setup.exe` created a temporary file at `C:\\Windows\\SystemTemp\\b8d633a2-08f3-4e51-85c3-3602fa580c63.tmp`.\n   - `smartscreen.exe` loaded `urlmon.dll`.\n   - `taskhostw.exe` loaded `taskschd.dll`.\n\nHere are a few potential security concerns based on the data:\n\n- The high number of registry changes by `chrome.exe` could indicate malicious extensions or scripts running in the browser.\n- The execution of unknown `setup.exe` and creation of a temporary file might suggest the installation of unwanted software.\n- Multiple processes loading `urlmon.dll`, a DLL used for URL moniker operations, could potentially indicate attempts to exploit vulnerabilities related to this library."}
