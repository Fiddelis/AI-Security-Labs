{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So the user wants me to analyze the batch of events and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Now, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I remember that sometimes malware uses unusual process names. But wait, the DLLs mentioned here are legitimate system files. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them might not be suspicious on its own. But if it's doing this multiple times, maybe there's something else going on.\n\nThen there's an entry with rundll32.exe executing a command involving shell32.dll. That's normal for some operations, but the command line has a GUID and -Embedding, which might be part of a legitimate process, like creating a COM server. But sometimes, this can be used by malware to execute code. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for monitoring and shipping logs. The file created is a configuration file, which seems normal. But if this is part of a setup or a malicious configuration, maybe. But again, not sure yet.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs. Most of these are standard, like combase.dll, mscoree.dll, amsi.dll. However, one of them is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but sometimes malware might try to bypass detection by loading Defender's DLLs. But that's a stretch without more evidence.\n\nThere are also multiple entries for User Account Management tasks. These might be related to user logins or changes, but since there's no specific process or file involved, they might just be normal system events. The same with the Logon and Special Logon tasks. They don't seem suspicious unless there's an unusual pattern, but the logs don't show that here.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of certain events. For example, the same ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE. But EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs is normal during execution. The same with svchost.exe and Registry value sets, which are common for system services.\n\nNow, considering all these, the main red flags are the SDXHelper.exe process loading system DLLs multiple times. However, since those DLLs are legitimate, it's not conclusive. The other events don't show any clear signs of malicious activity. There's no network connection, no unusual file creation, no privilege escalation, or other common attack indicators. The presence of a legitimate tool like winlogbeat and normal user activities (like opening Excel) are part of regular operations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there are a few suspicious processes, none of the events point to a clear malicious activity. The system logs don't show any definitive signs of a security threat. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the SDXHelper.exe is a false positive, or maybe there's a hidden process. However, without more data, like network traffic or other logs, it's hard to confirm. So the conclusion is that there's no strong evidence of a security incident here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided system logs do not contain clear evidence of malicious activity or security incidents. Here's a structured analysis of the key observations and their implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. SDXHelper.exe and System DLLs**\n- **Activity**: Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` loading legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`).\n- **Assessment**: While `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process, the DLLs involved are legitimate system files. This alone is not suspicious, as third-party applications can legitimately load system DLLs. However, the repeated use of this process warrants further investigation (e.g., verifying its origin, checking for unexpected behavior, or correlating with network activity).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Rundll32.exe and COM Server Execution**\n- **Activity**: `rundll32.exe` executed a command involving `shell32.dll` with a GUID and `-Embedding` flag.\n- **Assessment**: This is a common legitimate operation for creating COM servers. However, the use of `-Embedding` can sometimes be exploited by malware. No additional context (e.g., unexpected file creation, network activity) is present here, so this is inconclusive.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Winlogbeat.exe File Creation**\n- **Activity**: `winlogbeat.exe` created a configuration file (`winlogbeat.yml`) in the user's Downloads directory.\n- **Assessment**: Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log monitoring. File creation in the Downloads directory is normal during setup. No malicious intent is indicated here.\n\n---\n\n### **4. EXCEL.EXE and DLL Loading**\n- **Activity**: `EXCEL.EXE` loaded several system DLLs, including `amsi.dll` (Windows Defender) and `MpOAV.dll`.\n- **Assessment**: Loading system DLLs is expected for Excel. The involvement of Defender-related DLLs is not inherently suspicious unless there is evidence of tampering or bypassing security mechanisms (e.g., disabling Defender). No such evidence is present in the logs.\n\n---\n\n### **5. User Account Management and Logon Events**\n- **Activity**: Multiple entries for \"User Account Management\" and \"Logon\" tasks with no specific processes or files involved.\n- **Assessment**: These are standard system events and do not indicate malicious activity. The absence of details (e.g., user accounts, authentication failures) limits further analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Other Notes**\n- **No Network Activity**: No DNS queries or network connections (other than one `DnsQuery` by `EXCEL.EXE`, which is normal for lookups).\n- **No Privilege Escalation or Exploits**: No events suggest elevation of privileges, file modifications, or exploitation attempts.\n- **Legitimate Processes**: Most processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`) are standard system components.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs do not contain definitive indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as malicious file creation, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation. While the presence of non-standard processes like `SDXHelper.exe` raises a minor flag, it is not sufficient to conclude a security incident without further context (e.g., file hashes, network traffic, user behavior). \n\n**Recommendation**: Monitor the system for unusual behavior related to `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., unexpected network connections, file modifications) and consider correlating these logs with other telemetry (e.g., antivirus alerts, network logs) for a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Final Verdict**: **Not interesting for investigation** based on the provided data."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the process EXCEL.EXE creating a file named real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. The path is in the AppData Roaming Microsoft Office Recent directory, which is a common place for recent files. But the file has a .LNK extension, which is a shortcut. Creating a shortcut isn't necessarily malicious, but sometimes attackers create shortcuts to hide malicious files or to execute payloads when opened.\n\nThen there are several entries where the process is null, and the task is \"None\". Those might be incomplete or irrelevant logs, maybe errors or placeholders. But the main points here are the Excel process creating the shortcut and the DNS queries from Excel. \n\nDNS queries from Excel could be suspicious. Normally, Excel doesn't perform DNS queries unless it's connecting to a network resource or there's some macro activity. If there are multiple DNS queries, that might indicate communication with a C2 server. However, the logs don't specify the domain or IP addresses, so that's a bit unclear. \n\nBut the main thing is the creation of the .LNK file. If this is part of a larger attack, like a phishing attempt where the shortcut points to a malicious file, that could be a red flag. However, without more context, like the content of the shortcut or further malicious activities, it's a bit ambiguous. The presence of multiple DNS queries might be benign if Excel is accessing online resources, but combined with the shortcut creation, it raises some flags.\n\nHowever, the classification needs to be based on the entire batch. The majority of the logs are about the shortcut creation and DNS queries. Since there are no other obvious signs of compromise, but the combination of creating a shortcut and DNS queries from Excel could be suspicious. But I should check if this is common behavior. Excel might sometimes generate shortcuts, but DNS queries from it are less common. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch is interesting enough to warrant further investigation. The confidence might be around 0.6 because there's some suspicious activity but not enough to confirm a threat without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK shortcut in the Office Recent directory and performing DNS queries, which could indicate malicious activity like shortcut-based attacks or C2 communication. However, no direct malicious payload or clear indicators of compromise (e.g., unusual domains) are present in the logs.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
