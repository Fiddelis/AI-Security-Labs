{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. First, I'll look through each entry to see what's happening.\n\nThere are multiple entries related to winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. That's a configuration file for Winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Creating such a file might be normal if it's part of an installation or configuration process, but repeated creation could indicate something else, like a potential tampering or a misconfiguration.\n\nThen there are several PowerShell.exe processes. The events include Process Access, Image Load, and File Create\/Delete. The Image Load events show loading of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are standard for PowerShell when running scripts, but the frequency might be a red flag. Also, there's a FileCreate followed by a FileDelete for a temporary script file. That could be normal script execution, but if the script is malicious, that's a concern.\n\nThe ssh.exe events include a Network connection and a File created for known_hosts, which is a normal part of SSH setup. So that might not be suspicious.\n\nThere are also multiple Provider Lifecycle events for PowerShell, which might be related to the execution policy or other PowerShell features. However, the repetition of these events could indicate something unusual.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: multiple file creations and deletions by PowerShell, loading of various DLLs, and repeated Winlogbeat file creation. The presence of Winlogbeat might be legitimate, but if it's being used in conjunction with PowerShell activities that are creating and deleting files rapidly, that could be a sign of a script trying to execute malicious actions without leaving traces.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like connecting to a C2 server, downloading payloads, or executing suspicious commands. The events are mostly related to process creation, file operations, and image loading, which can be part of normal operations. But the combination of these events, especially the repeated file creation and deletion by PowerShell, might warrant further investigation to ensure that the scripts being run are not harmful.\n\nConfidence is a bit moderate here. It's not a clear-cut attack, but the patterns are suspicious enough to be considered interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances performing file creation\/deletion operations, combined with repeated Winlogbeat file creation events, suggest potential script-based activity that may warrant further investigation for anomalous behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these two events. Both are from svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The first event mentions a file created in the XboxLive directory under the systemprofile's AppData. The second event is another file creation in the same directory, specifically AuthStateCache.dat.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is normal, but creating files in certain locations might be suspicious. However, the XboxLive directory is part of the user profile, and AuthStateCache.dat sounds like a legitimate file related to Xbox authentication. These files could be part of normal operations, especially if the system is used for gaming or online services.\n\nBut wait, why are there two separate events for file creation? Maybe it's just the system initializing or updating some cache. Since both files are in a known directory and the process is svchost.exe, which is trusted, this might not be malicious. However, I should check if there are any other indicators. The user hasn't provided more events, so based on just these two, there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. The classification would likely be NOT INTERESTING because the activities are within normal system behavior. Confidence is around 0.6 because while it's not suspicious, without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve svchost.exe creating files in the legitimate XboxLive directory under systemprofile AppData, which is consistent with normal system behavior for authentication state caching. No suspicious indicators present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
