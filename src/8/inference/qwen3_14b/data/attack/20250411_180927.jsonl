{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a Registry value set. That's a common tool, but maybe not suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's adding a user and adding them to the administrators group. The command line shows \"net user \/add\" and \"net localgroup administrators\". That's definitely a red flag because creating new user accounts and adding them to admin groups is a typical attack vector. Malicious actors often do this to gain persistent access.\n\nLooking further, there's another cmd.exe process adding another user, \"modulo_principal_Admin\" with a password. Then there's a net1.exe, which is a suspicious name. The legitimate net.exe is part of Windows, but net1.exe isn't standard. The path is \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1\", which is odd because system32 should have legitimate binaries. This could be a malicious executable masquerading as a legitimate one, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for \"Security Group Management\" and \"User Account Management\" in the winlog task. These are high-level events that indicate changes to user accounts or groups, which are significant. Even though some entries have \"process\": None, the tasks themselves are noteworthy because they suggest administrative changes.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, but creating a new file might be normal, though it's worth checking if it's part of a legitimate configuration or if it's being used for something else. However, the presence of multiple registry changes and user account modifications seems more concerning.\n\nOther entries involve processes like svchost.exe and OneDrive.exe loading BitsProxy.dll. While svchost is a standard host process, loading a DLL could be benign, but if it's from an unusual path or context, it might be suspicious. However, in this case, the paths are standard, so maybe not. The chrome.exe and Calculator.exe entries are accessing the registry, but that's common for those applications.\n\nPutting it all together: the key points are the creation of new user accounts with administrative privileges using cmd.exe and net1.exe, which is a non-standard executable. The repeated user and group management events, along with the use of a suspicious executable (net1.exe), indicate potential malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these actions—especially the account creation and the use of an unusual executable—points to a possible security incident. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate unauthorized user account creation (e.g., 'net user \/add' commands) and administrative group modifications, which are common in privilege escalation attacks. Suspicious use of 'net1.exe' (non-standard Windows tool) and repeated registry access by PowerShell suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"MITRE_TECHNIQUES\": [\"T1136 (Create Account)\", \"T1053 (Scheduled Task Configuration)\", \"T1560 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)\"]\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about 'chrome.exe' performing registry value sets. That's a lot of them. But registry changes can be normal, like when software installs or updates. However, if there's a pattern or something unusual, that might be a red flag. But in this case, all the registry events are the same—'Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)'. There's no mention of specific keys being modified or any suspicious values. So maybe that's just normal behavior for Chrome?\n\nThen there are a couple of 'Image loaded' events. One is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. That's a legitimate file, so loading it isn't necessarily bad. The other is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender as well. Both are expected in a system with Defender running. So those might just be normal operations.\n\nNext, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file makes sense. The file path seems legitimate, and the name is a typical .yml.new file for configuration. No signs of tampering here.\n\nAnother event is from 'powershell.exe' creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't inherently suspicious. However, the name 'componente_secundario.txt' is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring. But without more context, like the content of the file or other related events, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, the majority of events are related to Chrome and legitimate system processes. The registry changes are repetitive and don't indicate any obvious malicious activity. The image loads are for legitimate DLLs. The file creations by winlogbeat and powershell are in expected locations and don't show signs of being part of an attack. \n\nBut wait, why is there so much activity from chrome.exe? Could that be a sign of something? For example, if Chrome is modifying the registry a lot, maybe it's being used as a vector for something. However, Chrome does modify the registry during its normal operations, like handling plugins or settings. Without seeing specific registry keys or unusual behavior, it's hard to flag this as malicious.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are there any other indicators of compromise? The events don't show any failed logins, unusual network activity, or privilege escalation. All the processes mentioned are legitimate. The only potentially odd thing is the repeated registry events, but they're all the same. \n\nSo overall, the batch doesn't have clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly normal system operations. Unless there's more context or other events not included here, this batch doesn't seem to be interesting for investigation. The confidence is medium because while there's a lot of Chrome activity, without more specific indicators, it's hard to be certain. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, it's probably not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine activity from legitimate processes (chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) with no clear signs of malicious behavior. Registry modifications and file creation events align with normal operations (e.g., Windows Defender components, log shipping tools). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
