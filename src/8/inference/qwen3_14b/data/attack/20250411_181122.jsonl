{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a normal command to get the current user. Not too suspicious. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. One of them has a command_line that looks like it's searching for files containing \"password\" in various formats. That's a common technique used by attackers to find credentials. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of PowerShell accessing the registry and loading DLLs. The files loaded include some .NET DLLs, which are normal, but also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That might be legitimate, but the repeated loading of multiple DLLs could be a sign of something trying to inject code or use .NET for malicious activities. \n\nThen there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because attackers often create temporary files to execute scripts and then delete them to avoid leaving evidence. The file name is a PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack. \n\nAlso, the same command is repeated multiple times in the Provider Lifecycle events. That might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly to gather more information or evade detection. \n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which is a log shipper, but the user is fiddelis, and the file path is in the Downloads directory. Not sure if that's malicious, but combined with other events, it might be part of a larger incident. \n\nNotepad.exe and calc.exe are also present, but those are typically benign. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell events, the search for passwords, temporary file creation and deletion, and the loading of various DLLs does seem suspicious. \n\nI should check if there are any patterns here. The repeated use of PowerShell with the findstr and select-string commands suggests searching for sensitive information. The image loaded events might be part of a .NET-based attack. The file creation and deletion could be part of an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch does show signs of potentially malicious activity. The confidence level is high enough to flag it for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, indicating potential malicious behavior. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**:\n1. **PowerShell Command for Credential Harvesting**:\n   - Repeated execution of a PowerShell command searching for files containing \"password\" in various formats (`findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.xls | select-string -Pattern password`). This is a classic technique used to **siphon sensitive data** (e.g., credentials) from files.\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`*.yml.new`) is created and immediately deleted in the `Downloads` directory. This pattern is often used to **execute malicious scripts** without leaving persistent evidence.\n\n3. **Unusual DLL Loading**:\n   - Multiple **.NET DLLs** (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`) are loaded by `powershell.exe` and `calc.exe`. While some DLLs are legitimate, the **volume and context** of these loads may indicate **code injection** or exploitation of .NET-based vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Provider Lifecycle Events**:\n   - The same PowerShell command is logged repeatedly under \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, suggesting **automation or evasion tactics** to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Registry Access**:\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events by `powershell.exe` and `notepad.exe` could indicate **tampering with system configurations** or persistence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate Activity**:\n- **`whoami.exe`**: Normal command to check user context.\n- **`winlogbeat.exe`**: Log shipping tool; the file creation may be part of normal operations (though the location in `Downloads` is unusual).\n- **`notepad.exe` and `calc.exe`**: Typically benign, but their interaction with registry and DLLs raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe logs show **strong indicators of a potential attack**, including **credential harvesting, temporary file exploitation, and suspicious DLL loading**. While some processes (e.g., `winlogbeat.exe`) are legitimate, the **context and repetition of PowerShell activities** suggest a need for **further investigation** (e.g., checking file contents, analyzing network traffic, and inspecting system integrity).\n\n**Confidence Level**: High (75%+) — this warrants immediate attention."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. First, I need to scan through all the JSON entries to spot any suspicious activity. \n\nThe first event mentions powershell.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path seems legitimate, but sometimes attackers might use similar paths to hide malicious files. However, just loading a legitimate DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's a powershell command using findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. This could be a red flag if it's part of a script trying to extract sensitive information. But I need to check if this is a common legitimate activity. Sometimes users might run such commands to find passwords in documents, but it's also a technique used by attackers to steal credentials.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe and other processes setting registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if there's a pattern or multiple changes from different processes, that might indicate something's wrong. However, svchost is a common system process, so this might just be normal operations.\n\nAnother point is the repeated registry value sets from chrome.exe. Chrome might be updating its settings, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same goes for the DNS queries from chrome and OfficeClickToRun.exe. Those are usually normal for browsers and office apps.\n\nThe file creation by winlogbeat.exe seems legitimate as well. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. \n\nLooking back at the powershell command, the use of \"findstr\" with patterns like \"pass\" and \"password\" could be part of a script trying to find credentials. If this is done by a legitimate user, it's okay, but if it's part of a larger set of suspicious activities, it might be malicious. However, there's no other evidence here like network connections to bad IPs, unexpected process creations, or privilege escalation.\n\nThe only other thing is the first event about the DLL from Windows Defender. If that DLL was modified or if there's a mismatch in the hash, that would be a problem, but the event just says it's loaded. \n\nOverall, the most suspicious part is the powershell command searching for passwords. But since there's no other malicious activity in the batch, it might not be enough to classify as interesting. However, the presence of that command could be an indicator of a user trying to find passwords, which might be part of a larger attack. But without more events, it's a bit ambiguous. I think it's on the borderline. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6, but I need to decide if it's enough to be interesting. Since the command is a known method for credential harvesting, and it's executed by powershell, which is often abused, maybe it's worth flagging as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a PowerShell command searching for 'password' patterns in files, which is a common technique for credential harvesting. While some events (e.g., Chrome DNS queries, svchost registry changes) are normal, the combination of the password search command and multiple PowerShell\/registry activities raises suspicion of potential credential extraction or reconnaissance.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe loaded an image from the Windows Defender path. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that might be legitimate. But why is chrome.exe loading it? Maybe a false positive, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of them. Maybe that's normal, but maybe not. Then there are several network connections detected by chrome.exe. Multiple network connections could be normal, but if they're all going to the same place or unusual destinations, that might be a red flag. However, the logs don't specify the destination, so I can't tell yet.\n\nNext, there's a file created by powershell.exe named objeto_logico.txt. Not sure what that is, but creating files isn't inherently bad. Then, winlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of its normal operation. But why is it creating a new file? Maybe a configuration change.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creating estrutura_ativo.txt. Again, not sure. Then, a whoami.exe command is run. That's just getting user info, so probably benign. But then, cmd.exe is running schtasks to delete some tasks. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up, but if the tasks were malicious, that's a sign. However, the command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". The names are generic, but maybe they were legitimate tasks. However, the fact that someone is deleting scheduled tasks could be suspicious, especially if it's part of evading detection.\n\nThen, schtasks.exe is used to delete another task named \"elemento_base_005_OnLogon\". Again, deleting scheduled tasks might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of a larger pattern. Also, the command line for schtasks shows the task name, which is not obviously malicious, but the deletion could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe. Chrome is a common target for attacks, but also a common user application. Powershell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The use of schtasks to delete tasks might be part of an attempt to remove traces of an attack, like after executing some malicious code.\n\nThe multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe could indicate that someone is modifying registry settings, maybe to persist or alter system behavior. However, without knowing the specific keys or values, it's hard to say. But the frequency might be a concern.\n\nAlso, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a file might be part of normal operations, but if there's a lot of file creation or modification, that could be a sign. However, the logs don't show a lot of that.\n\nAnother point is the use of cmd.exe with schtasks to delete tasks. That might be part of an attacker trying to remove scheduled tasks that were used to execute malicious code. If the tasks were legitimate, that's odd. But if the tasks were malicious, deleting them would be a way to avoid detection.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry changes, network activity from chrome, deletion of scheduled tasks, and use of cmd and powershell. These could be signs of an attacker trying to modify system settings, communicate with a C2 server, and clean up after themselves. However, some of these could be legitimate. But the combination of these events, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks and the registry modifications, raises a red flag. It might be worth investigating further to see if there's a pattern or if the tasks being deleted were part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation, indicating potential **malicious behavior** or **system compromise**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n\n1. **Unusual Process Behavior:**\n   - **`chrome.exe` loading `taskschd.dll`** (a legitimate Windows component) and **multiple registry modifications** via `chrome.exe` and `powershell.exe`.  \n     - **Risk:** Chrome is not typically involved in registry changes. This could indicate **malware injection** or **tampering** with system settings.\n\n   - **`cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` deleting scheduled tasks** (e.g., `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`, `elemento_base_005_OnLogon`).  \n     - **Risk:** Deleting scheduled tasks is often a **post-exploitation technique** to remove traces of malicious activities or evade detection.\n\n2. **Potential Command-Line Manipulation:**\n   - **`cmd.exe` executing `schtasks \/delete`** with obfuscated task names (e.g., `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`).  \n     - **Risk:** The task names may be **obfuscated** or **non-standard**, hinting at **malicious task scheduling** or **cleanup** after exploitation.\n\n3. **Frequent Registry Modifications:**\n   - **`powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` modifying registry values** multiple times.  \n     - **Risk:** Could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries) or **tampering** with system behavior.\n\n4. **Unusual File Creation:**\n   - **`powershell.exe` creating files** like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt`.  \n     - **Risk:** While file creation alone is not malicious, combined with other activities, it may indicate **data exfiltration** or **log generation** by malware.\n\n5. **`whoami.exe` and `schtasks.exe` Usage:**\n   - **`whoami.exe`** (legitimate) is used to **identify the current user**, which could be a precursor to **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement**.\n   - **`schtasks.exe`** is used to **delete tasks**, which may be part of **cleaning up** after malicious operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threat Scenario:**\n- An attacker may have **exploited a vulnerability** (e.g., in Chrome or a service) to **inject malicious code**, then used **scheduled tasks** to execute payloads or persist on the system.\n- The **deletion of tasks** and **registry modifications** suggest an attempt to **avoid detection** or **maintain access**.\n- The use of **`powershell.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** for command-line operations is consistent with **post-exploitation activities** (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Steps:**\n1. **Analyze Network Traffic:**  \n   - Check if `chrome.exe` or other processes are communicating with **unusual IP addresses** or domains.\n2. **Inspect Registry Changes:**  \n   - Review the specific registry keys modified to identify **persistence mechanisms** or **malicious configurations**.\n3. **Check for Scheduled Tasks:**  \n   - Investigate the deleted tasks (e.g., `unidade_geral_005_OnLogon`) to determine if they were **malicious** or **benign**.\n4. **File Analysis:**  \n   - Examine files like `objeto_logico.txt` and `estrutura_ativo.txt` for **sensitive data** or **malware signatures**.\n5. **System Integrity Check:**  \n   - Use tools like **Windows Defender** or **SIEM** to detect **anomalies** in process behavior or file integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events suggest **potential compromise** or **malicious activity**. Immediate investigation is required to confirm whether the system has been **hijacked**, and to **contain the threat**."}

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: schtasks.exe is deleting a task called \"registro_base_005_OnStartup\". That could be normal if it's part of a cleanup, but deleting a scheduled task might be a red flag if it's done unexpectedly. The command line uses \/f, which forces the deletion without confirmation. Maybe the task was malicious, but I need more context.\n\nThen there's ImageLoad events for taskschd.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file. But later, WMIC.exe is used to delete notepad.exe processes. That's odd because WMIC is a legitimate tool, but deleting processes like notepad.exe might be part of a larger attack. Also, the command line uses redirection to suppress output, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the registry events: multiple entries involving Registry value set and Registry object added or deleted. Processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe are modifying the registry. That's concerning because changing registry keys can be part of persistence mechanisms or disabling security features.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe, which is normal, but combined with other commands, it might be used to gather information. The deletion of user accounts via net user \/del commands is a big red flag. Deleting user accounts could be part of an attack to remove access or cover tracks. The command line here is trying to delete users like \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\" and \"componente_comum_Admin\". That's definitely suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the presence of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool. The name seems like a typo or a renamed malicious executable. Using non-standard executables is a common tactic by attackers to evade detection.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various registry modifications and process deletions suggests someone is trying to manipulate the system. The combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, and deleting user accounts points towards an attempt to compromise the system, possibly for persistence or to remove evidence.\n\nHowever, some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities, especially the user account deletions and the use of non-standard executables, makes me think this is more likely malicious.

Some of these are common, like cmd and powershell, but their usage here might be a red flag. \n\nNow, checking the commands. There's a command line that deletes a user with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That's a clear sign of user account deletion, which could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation. Then there's \"sc delete win32times\", which is deleting a service. Deleting services might be an attempt to remove malicious software or hide activities, but it's also something attackers might do to avoid detection.\n\nRegistry value changes are frequent here. Processes like cmd.exe and powershell.exe are modifying registry values. That's often used by malware to persist or alter system behavior. Also, multiple instances of \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted\" could indicate someone trying to manipulate system settings.\n\nThere are also multiple \"Process accessed\" events for powershell.exe. PowerShell is a common tool for attackers due to its scripting capabilities. If it's being accessed repeatedly, that might be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe User Account Management and Security Group Management events could indicate changes to permissions or group memberships, which might be part of setting up access for an attacker.\n\nHowever, some entries have \"None\" for the process, which might be normal system events, but combined with the other suspicious activities, they add to the overall picture. \n\nPutting it all together: the presence of user deletion, service deletion, frequent registry changes, and multiple process accesses (especially with PowerShell) suggests potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points to something that needs further investigation.

That might be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use Temp folders to hide malicious files.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for powershell.exe with Process accessed and Registry value set events. That's a lot of activity. Also, there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually benign, just checks user identity. But the repeated PowerShell events might be worth noting.\n\nThen, there are several entries where PowerShell is loading .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell running scripts, but maybe not always. However, the interesting part is the file creation and deletion in the Temp directory. The file created is a PowerShell script policy test, and then it's immediately deleted. That could be a sign of someone testing script execution policies or trying to run scripts without leaving traces.\n\nAlso, the command line in one of the cmd.exe entries has a strange-looking command with del and redirection. It might be attempting to clean up after itself. The multiple registry writes could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to persist.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of PowerShell activity, file creation\/deletion in Temp, and registry changes might indicate someone trying to execute scripts and cover their tracks.

So, first, I need to scan through all the log entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a pipe created event. That's a bit common, but not necessarily bad. Then there's an engine lifecycle task. Still normal. But then there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but maybe not. Then a file created in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for malware to store stuff, so that's a red flag.\n\nNext, several registry value set events. Registry changes can be benign, but if there's a pattern, it might indicate something. Then, process accessed events for powershell.exe repeatedly. That's a lot of access events, which could mean someone is trying to manipulate the process. \n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. That's a simple command to get user info, but if it's run many times, maybe part of a script or probing. Also, the same process create events for whoami.exe multiple times. That's unusual. \n\nLooking at the other processes: conhost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe. Some of these are normal system processes, but svchost.exe having registry changes might be part of normal operations, but combined with others?\n\nWait, the file created by winlogbeat.exe is a .yml.new file. That might be a configuration file being modified, but if it's part of a legitimate setup, maybe okay. However, the presence of multiple whoami.exe executions and the file creation in AppData could be part of a larger attack. \n\nAlso, the repeated process accessed events on powershell.exe might indicate that someone is trying to inject code or monitor the process. The image loaded for urlmon.dll in both calc.exe and Calculator.exe is normal, as that's a system DLL. \n\nBut the combination of multiple suspicious activities: file creation in user directories, repeated process accesses, registry changes, and multiple executions of whoami.exe might indicate a potential security incident. However, some of these could be false positives or legitimate activities. \n\nBut since the user is asking for classification, and considering that there are multiple events that could be part of malicious behavior, even if not conclusive, it's better to flag it as interesting for further investigation.

The ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying registry values—those are odd because Calculator is typically not involved in registry changes. Chrome has several DNS queries and network connections, which is normal for browsing, but the high number might indicate something.
