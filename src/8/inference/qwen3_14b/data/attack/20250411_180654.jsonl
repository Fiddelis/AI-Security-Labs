{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. But then there are multiple entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets related to chrome.exe. Chrome accessing the registry a lot might be normal, but repeated entries could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a legitimate command to get user info, but if it's part of a larger attack, maybe. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe key part is the PowerShell processes. There are several entries where PowerShell is running with command lines that include Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. The script paths are all over the place, like C:\\tarefa_base\\tarefa_geral\\... and others. The -LogPath parameter points to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which suggests that these scripts are logging keystrokes. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with keyloggers, which are malicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. While loading .NET assemblies isn't unusual, the combination with the PowerShell scripts that are likely malicious makes this more suspicious. The fact that the same script name (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) is used in different paths might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the location or evade detection.\n\nThe repetition of similar events, especially the PowerShell commands with the same script name and logging to temp directories, points towards a potential attack. Even though some events are normal (like chrome.exe accessing the registry), the presence of the keystroke logging scripts and the multiple PowerShell executions with those scripts are concerning. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The first event is a file creation, but the rest are about process access and registry changes. The multiple PowerShell commands with the same script name in different directories might be an attempt to hide the script's location. The use of $env:TEMP for logging is a common tactic for malware to store data temporarily.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes PowerShell execution of scripts that are likely keyloggers, which is a clear sign of malicious activity. Even though some events are benign, the presence of these scripts and the repeated access patterns make this batch interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with log paths in temporary directories, indicating potential keystroke logging malware.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. There are several instances where the command line includes executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path pointing to the TEMP directory. The script's path varies, but the name is consistent. \n\nWait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds suspicious. That name might indicate a script that's capturing keystrokes, which is a common technique used by malware to steal sensitive information. The fact that it's being run multiple times from different paths could be a red flag. Also, the log files are being created in the TEMP directory, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files.\n\nOther events include file creations and deletions, some image loads, and registry changes. But the most notable part is the repeated execution of that PowerShell script. Even though some of the other events might be normal (like Windows Defender loading DLLs), the keystroke logging script is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of remote command execution. One event mentions \"Execute a Remote Command\" with a file path that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1 again. That ties into the previous points. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to assume. Maybe the user is running legitimate scripts with similar names. But given the context and the common use of such script names in malicious activities, the combination of multiple executions and the script's purpose points towards something worth investigating. \n\nThe confidence here would be high, but not 100% certain. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a justification focusing on the keystroke logging scripts and their repeated execution.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directories suggest potential keystroke logging activity, a common malware technique.
