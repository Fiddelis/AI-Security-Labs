That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see powershell.exe activities. \n\nLooking at the seventh event, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that downloads a file from a GitHub URL using WebClient. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common place for hosting text files, but the fact that PowerShell is being used to download files might be a red flag. Also, the file is saved to the TEMP directory, which is often used by malware to store temporary files.\n\nThen there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some of these are legitimate .NET framework DLLs, but others like MpOAV.dll are related to Windows Defender. However, the presence of multiple image loads could indicate that something is trying to inject code or load additional components.\n\nNext, there are FileCreate and FileDelete events. A temporary file is created and then immediately deleted. This could be part of a script that's executing and cleaning up, which is common in some malicious activities. The fact that the file is created and then deleted quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other PowerShell processes with similar command lines, all downloading LICENSE.txt files from different GitHub repositories. While LICENSE.txt files are usually benign, the pattern of multiple downloads might indicate that the user is trying to execute scripts or download payloads. The use of PowerShell for such activities can be a sign of malicious intent, especially if it's not part of normal user behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: the combination of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and multiple network connections could indicate a potential security threat. Even though some of these actions are normal, the frequency and the specific use of PowerShell for downloading files might be suspicious. However, I need to check if there's any clear evidence of malicious activity. Since the files being downloaded are LICENSE.txt, which are typically harmless, but the overall pattern might still be worth investigating to ensure there's no hidden malicious code being executed.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows PowerShell executing multiple network downloads from GitHub repositories, loading several system DLLs (including Windows Defender components), and creating\/deleting temporary files.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes with command lines that use WebClient.DownloadFile to download files from GitHub. The URLs are all pointing to LICENSE.txt files from different repositories. That seems a bit odd because normally, LICENSE.txt is a standard file, but using PowerShell to download it might be part of a malicious script. However, GitHub is a legitimate source, so maybe it's just a normal activity. But the fact that multiple downloads are happening could be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are events related to file creation, like 'estrutura_temporario.txt' and 'tarefa_ativo.txt' in the TEMP directory. Creating files in TEMP is common, but if those files are being used to execute code or store malicious data, that's a red flag. However, the files here are just text files from GitHub, which might be benign.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are multiple registry value set events by chrome.exe and others. Chrome modifying the registry isn't necessarily bad, but repeated events might indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a network connection detected by MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's a lot of network activity, it could be worth checking.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory is part of log collection, so that's probably legitimate. The user might be using it for monitoring.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub, file creations in temporary directories, and a lot of registry changes. However, the URLs are all pointing to legitimate GitHub repositories. It's possible that this is just a user downloading license files and testing PowerShell scripts, which isn't malicious. But the repetition and the use of PowerShell for downloading could be part of a larger attack, like downloading a payload. However, without seeing the actual content of the downloaded files or more suspicious activities (like execution of those files, unusual process behavior, etc.), it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe confidence here might be around 0.6. It's not extremely suspicious, but there are enough indicators that warrant further investigation. The justification would be the multiple PowerShell downloads from GitHub and file creations in temporary directories, which could be part of a malicious activity, but without more evidence, it's not conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing commands to download files from GitHub repositories (LICENSE.txt) and creating files in temporary directories, which could indicate potential malicious activity or reconnaissance.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a legitimate process, but maybe there's something else. Then there are multiple svchost.exe entries with registry value sets. svchost is normal, but repeated registry changes might be a red flag. \n\nWait, there's a Calculator.exe entry, which is similar to calc.exe. But the path is the same system file. Maybe that's just a normal process. Then powershell.exe appears several times with ProcessAccess events. PowerShell is often used by attackers, so that's suspicious. \n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a scheduled task named \"spawn\". Deleting tasks could be part of cleaning up after malicious activity. Also, there's a reg.exe command deleting entries from the Run key in the registry. Modifying registry Run keys is a common technique for persistence, so that's concerning. \n\nAnother cmd.exe instance deletes a registry value named \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These names don't look standard, which might indicate they're trying to remove traces of their own malicious entries. \n\nThe use of SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\" and the multiple registry deletions suggest someone is trying to remove evidence. Also, the repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe could indicate it's being used to execute commands without proper authorization. \n\nPutting it all together: the combination of deleting scheduled tasks, modifying registry Run keys, and frequent PowerShell activity points to potential malicious behavior.

There's a lot of 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be normal, but I should check for any anomalies. Then I see some 'Image loaded' events. The files loaded include some .dlls from the .NET Framework, which is common, but there's also 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe the presence here isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nWait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1' in the Temp directory. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be a sign of something trying to execute a script without leaving traces. Also, the 'File created' event for the PowerShell startup profile might be normal, but combined with the temp file, it's worth noting.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events. If there are multiple registry changes or process accesses, that could indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings.

The 'whoami.exe' is standard, but the repeated 'powershell.exe' activity might be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the 'file' entries, there's a 'File created' event for a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory.

That's suspicious because creating and deleting a temporary file could be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up traces. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe', which might indicate attempts to modify registry settings, possibly for persistence or altering system behavior.

The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Pipe Created, and Process accessed. Some of these are normal, but I notice that powershell.exe is appearing a lot. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry where a file is created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That path seems a bit off. StartupProfileData-NonInteractive might be a custom or unusual name, which could indicate something malicious. Also, the command line for one of the processes is \"powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". Removing a file might be part of cleaning up after an attack, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there are several Image Loaded events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something wrong. However, since they're standard .NET components, it might not be a direct indicator of malware.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which is a standard tool to check the current user, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe repeated Registry value set events and Process accessed events could indicate that an attacker is modifying system settings or accessing processes to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple PowerShell events with various commands and file operations might be more indicative of a potential attack, especially the file removal command.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the batch should be considered as a whole. There's a lot of activity, but many of the events are normal. For example, Chrome.exe doing Registry value sets might be part of its own operations. However, the combination of PowerShell's suspicious commands, file creation in unusual locations, and multiple registry changes could be pointing towards an attack.\n\nI should also check if there are any known malicious indicators. The file paths mentioned don't seem to be known malicious ones, but the actions taken (like removing a file) are suspicious. The confidence here might be moderate.

So, first, I need to scan through all the logs and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe loading an image from the Windows Defender path. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate processes. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That could be a red flag because creating and deleting a script quickly might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of Remove-Item commands in the command_line fields, all targeting .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory.

The whoami.exe process is a standard tool for checking user identity, so that's probably benign.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are the PowerShell activities involving creating and deleting files in TEMP, using Remove-Item with error suppression, and the potential for these actions to be part of a malicious script execution.

Chrome might modify the registry for updates or settings, but multiple entries could be a red flag. However, without more context, maybe it's just regular activity.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. That's a legitimate process, but again, if it's doing something unusual, it might be a problem. But again, not sure yet.\n\nNow, looking at the other entries, there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activities. But just being accessed isn't necessarily bad. However, if it's being used for suspicious commands, that's a problem. But in the logs, the command_line for whoami.exe is shown, which is a normal command to get the current user. So that's just a regular process.\n\nWait, the whoami.exe is being created multiple times. That's part of the normal process creation, but if it's being called repeatedly, maybe that's part of some script or malicious activity. But again, without more info, hard to tell.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so that's probably normal. The file path seems to be in the user's Downloads directory, which is common for software installations. The other file created is pacote_ativo.txt, which might be a benign file, but the name doesn't stand out as malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a lot of registry changes by chrome and RuntimeBroker, which could be normal. The repeated access of PowerShell and whoami might be part of normal user activity or scripts. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications and process accesses might indicate something, but not definitively malicious. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or suspicious commands beyond whoami, which is normal, I might lean towards NOT INTERESTING. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence is medium. However, the user is asking for a classification. If there's no clear indicator of compromise, then it's not interesting. But maybe the high number of events could be a sign. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the combination of registry changes and process accesses is worth looking into.
