{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe, setting triggers for logon, and specifying the Administrators group with high run level. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges can be a sign of malicious activity, especially if it's done multiple times with different task names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The repetition of these commands might indicate an attempt to establish persistent access on the system.\n\nThen, there are several entries under \"winlog\" with tasks like \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\". These could be part of normal operations, but combined with the PowerShell activities, they might suggest that the attacker is modifying registry settings or accessing processes to maintain control. The \"Image loaded\" events mention loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. While these are legitimate components, their loading in the context of PowerShell scripts could be part of a more complex attack, maybe trying to execute .NET code or evade detection.\n\nHowever, there are also entries for chrome.exe and other normal processes. But the key here is the pattern of the PowerShell commands. Creating multiple scheduled tasks with administrative rights is suspicious. Even though calc.exe is a benign application, using it in this context might be a test or a way to execute arbitrary code. The fact that the tasks are registered under different names suggests an attempt to obfuscate the activity.\n\nConfidence-wise, the presence of multiple scheduled task creations with elevated privileges is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. However, without more context like network activity or file changes, it's not definitive. But the combination of these events makes it interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns:**\n1. **Repetitive Scheduled Task Creation via PowerShell:**\n   - Multiple entries show PowerShell executing commands to create **scheduled tasks** with:\n     - **`calc.exe`** as the payload (often a red flag for obfuscation or testing).\n     - **Administrators group** permissions (`-GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\"`) with **High Run Level**.\n     - Unique task names (e.g., `\"unidade_ativo\"`, `\"tarefa_geral\"`) suggesting obfuscation or persistence attempts.\n   - **Why Suspicious?** Creating multiple scheduled tasks with elevated privileges is a common tactic for **persistence** or **privilege escalation**.\n\n2. **Loading .NET DLLs in PowerShell Context:**\n   - Events like `ImageLoad` for **`mscoree.dll`**, **`clr.dll`**, and **`clrjit.dll`** indicate .NET runtime components are being loaded. While legitimate, this could signal:\n     - **Execution of .NET-based payloads** (e.g., malicious scripts or compiled code).\n     - **Obfuscation** to evade detection (e.g., using .NET to execute arbitrary code).\n\n3. **Registry and Process Activity:**\n   - Frequent **registry modifications** (`Registry value set`) and **process access** (`Process accessed`) may indicate attempts to **modify system behavior** or **monitor\/interfere with other processes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Persistence Mechanism:** The scheduled tasks could be part of a **long-term foothold** in the system.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Using `Administrators` group permissions suggests an attempt to **escalate privileges** or bypass restrictions.\n- **Obfuscation:** The use of `.NET` and repeated task names may be designed to **evade detection** by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Investigation:**\n1. **Check Task Scheduler:** Verify if the listed tasks exist and their actual payloads.\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:** Examine the full command line (e.g., `Register-ScheduledTask` parameters) for hidden malicious code.\n3. **Network Traffic:** Look for unusual outbound connections (e.g., C2 communication) during task execution.\n4. **File Integrity Checks:** Confirm if `calc.exe` or other binaries are modified or replaced.\n\n---\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n- **High Suspicion (70-80%)** due to the **repetitive, elevated-privilege task creation** and **.NET-related activity**. However, **further analysis** (e.g., checking task details, network behavior) is needed to confirm malicious intent."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. There are several PowerShell.exe processes. The first few events mention file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which might be normal, but then there's a command line that stands out. The command line shows PowerShell being used to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe with high privileges for administrators. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be part of a privilege escalation attempt.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with \"Execute a Remote Command\" task, but the process is listed as None. That might indicate something like a service or a remote execution without a clear process, which could be a red flag. However, the repetition of these entries might be noise or part of a legitimate process, but combined with the scheduled task creation, it raises concerns.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. If there are many of them, it could be part of normal operations, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the majority of the suspicious activity is around PowerShell and the scheduled tasks.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The scheduled task creation with high privileges is a strong indicator, but the other events might be benign. However, the combination of creating a scheduled task and multiple remote command executions could point to a potential attack. I'd say around 0.75 confidence because there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not definitive proof of a security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include suspicious scheduled task creation with administrative privileges and execution of calc.exe, which may indicate privilege escalation or persistence attempts. Additionally, numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events without associated processes suggest potential remote access activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to analyze these log entries and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there's an entry about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes to load malicious DLLs. However, taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so maybe that's normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be normal, but if it's done repeatedly or in a suspicious way, that might be a red flag. But there are multiple instances here, so maybe it's just normal system activity.\n\nAnother event is the creation of a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". That doesn't ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's a typo or a non-English name? \"Unidade_comum\" might be Portuguese for \"common unit\", but I'm not sure. Could be a legitimate file or something suspicious.\n\nThen there's an entry with process None executing a remote command. That's concerning because if the process field is None, it might mean the event didn't capture the process, which could be a sign of something evading detection. But I need to check if that's a common occurrence or if it's a real issue here.\n\nPowerShell.exe creating files in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and other download directories. Creating files in user directories might be normal, but if it's part of a script or downloading something, that could be malicious. However, the filenames here don't look obviously malicious. The .txt files might be benign, but sometimes attackers use such files to execute scripts.\n\nChrome.exe has several entries about registry value sets and image loads. Loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files related to Windows Defender and Anti-Malware. So that's probably normal. But if there's unusual activity with those, it might be a problem. However, the entries here don't indicate any issues.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The file path suggests it's part of an installation or configuration change, which is normal.\n\nThe repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe and others might be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern of many registry changes, that could be a sign of something trying to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe remote command execution with process None is a bit suspicious. If the system is logging events where the process isn't identified, that might indicate a problem with the logging or actual malicious activity that's hiding the process. But maybe it's just a log gap.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some suspicious elements like the remote command execution with no process, and the file creation in the Tasks directory. However, many of the other events are normal system activities. The confidence here is a bit low because while there are some red flags, they might not be enough on their own. But since there's at least one suspicious event (remote command with no process), it might warrant further investigation. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe, which could indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process may suggest hidden or evasive activity. The file creation in the 'Tasks' directory ('unidade_comum') and repeated Winlogbeat configuration file writes also warrant scrutiny for potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
