{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user gave me a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the whole batch is interesting for investigation. The possible classifications are \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I should look through the events to see if there's any suspicious activity. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first few entries are about processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is a legitimate command that displays user information, but it's often used in malicious scripts. However, just running whoami isn't necessarily bad. Then there's a lot of ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. ProcessAccess might indicate that a process is being accessed, which could be normal, but if it's frequent or combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry for cmd.exe with a command line that includes creating a service with a path pointing to a non-existent script: \"c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The fact that the script doesn't exist might be a clue. Sometimes attackers create services that point to non-existent files, which could be part of a planned attack or a failed attempt. Also, the command uses \"sc create\" to set up a service, which is a legitimate command but can be abused for persistence.\n\nAnother entry has sc.exe creating a service with a binPath that points to another non-existent script: \"c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". This seems similar. Creating services with non-existent paths might be an attempt to establish persistence or to hide the malicious activity. Also, the use of \"cmd \/c start\" suggests that the service is trying to execute a script, but since the file doesn't exist, it might not be working as intended. However, this could still be part of a larger attack plan.\n\nThere are multiple events related to Registry value set (RegistryEvent) by various processes like services.exe, cmd.exe, and others. Changing registry values can be part of malware's persistence mechanisms, so that's suspicious. However, legitimate software also modifies the registry, so this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nThen there's an entry for calc.exe (calculator) with an image loaded from urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows and is used for Internet-related functions, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, that might be unusual. However, I'm not sure if that's a clear indicator of malicious activity without more context.\n\nAnother event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so this might be normal user activity, like installing or configuring the tool. Unless there's something suspicious about the file name or path, this might not be an issue.\n\nLooking at the frequency of events: there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed, which is common, but combined with the service creation attempts and registry changes, it might indicate something. However, the presence of non-existent files in the service paths is a red flag. Attackers sometimes leave such traces when they're trying to set up persistence but the files aren't yet in place.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple registry modifications could be an attempt to modify system settings for persistence or to disable security features. However, without more context on what exactly is being changed, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The non-existent service paths and the registry changes are suspicious, but they could also be part of a failed attack or a user's mistake. However, the combination of these factors might be enough to flag the batch as interesting for further investigation. The presence of multiple suspicious activities, even if not definitively malicious, warrants attention.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Key indicators include:\n\n1. **Service Creation with Non-Existent Paths**:  \n   - `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` attempts to create services pointing to non-existent scripts (`unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1`). This suggests potential **malicious persistence attempts** or **failed attacks**, as the referenced files do not exist.\n\n2. **Frequent Registry Modifications**:  \n   - Multiple processes (e.g., `services.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `svchost.exe`) trigger `RegistryEvent` entries. While registry changes are common, this frequency could indicate **malware persistence mechanisms** or **system tampering**.\n\n3. **Unusual Process Behavior**:  \n   - `calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe` load `urlmon.dll`, which is unusual for these processes. This could signal **code injection** or **malicious activity** (though further analysis is required).\n\n4. **Legitimate Tools in Suspicious Contexts**:  \n   - `winlogbeat.exe` creates a `.yml.new` file in the Downloads directory. While this may be normal user activity (e.g., configuration), it could also indicate **tool misuse** or **data exfiltration** if the file is tampered with.\n\n---\n\n**Classification**: **INTERESTING**  \n**Justification**: The combination of non-existent service paths, frequent registry modifications, and unusual process behavior (e.g., `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`) suggests potential **malicious activity** or **security misconfigurations** requiring deeper analysis.  \n**Confidence**: 75% (Suspicious patterns are present, but additional context is needed to confirm malicious intent)."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, there are eight entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". The file is None for all of them. Then there's another two entries where chrome.exe has \"Image loaded\" tasks, with specific DLL paths. The last one is powershell.exe with a \"Process accessed\" event.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that chrome.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. But is that normal? Chrome might modify the registry for its own settings, but doing it multiple times could be suspicious. However, the registry events alone might not be enough to raise a red flag unless there's a pattern or specific keys being modified. But the logs don't mention the specific registry keys, so maybe that's not enough.\n\nThen, looking at the image loaded events. The first one is amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If chrome.exe is loading that DLL, maybe that's normal? But the second image loaded is MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Platform. Wait, but why would chrome.exe be loading those DLLs? Typically, those are loaded by Defender itself. If a legitimate process like chrome is loading Defender's DLLs, that might be unusual. Maybe it's a false positive, but it could also indicate something malicious trying to mimic legitimate processes.\n\nThen there's the powershell.exe event with a process accessed rule. PowerShell is often used in attacks, but by itself, it's not suspicious. However, if it's accessing processes in a way that's not typical, that could be an issue. But the log doesn't specify what process it accessed, so that's a bit vague.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe could be normal, but the image loaded events for Defender DLLs by chrome might be suspicious. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys or the nature of the process access, it's hard to be certain. But considering that the same process is doing multiple registry changes and loading DLLs that are typically associated with security software, it might be worth investigating. However, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be around 0.65-0.7. But I need to check if there's a pattern that's more indicative of malicious activity. For example, if the registry changes are to specific keys that are known for malware, but since the logs don't specify, it's hard to tell. So, the presence of chrome.exe loading Defender DLLs might be more concerning than the registry events. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the classification is interesting, but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes triggering 'Registry value set' events and loading Windows Defender DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) could indicate unusual behavior, such as evasion techniques or attempts to interact with security mechanisms. The combination of registry modifications and unexpected DLL loading warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
