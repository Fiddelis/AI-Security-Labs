{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look for any patterns or anomalies.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of \"SDXHelper.exe\" and \"powershell.exe\" entries. The SDXHelper.exe is loading various DLLs like combase.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. Wait, those are all legitimate Windows system DLLs. But why is SDXHelper.exe loading them? Maybe that's normal, but maybe not. I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's \"taskhostw.exe\" loading taskschd.dll, which is part of the Task Scheduler. That seems normal. But then there's a \"Special Logon\" event with process null. That might be a logon event, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell entries, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be part of normal script execution, but sometimes malware does that to hide evidence. Also, the PowerShell process is loading several .NET DLLs, which is typical for PowerShell scripts. But then there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest... that's a temporary file, maybe part of a script test. But the fact that it's created and then deleted might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nAnother point is the multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell. These events are related to PowerShell providers, which are used to access data, but if they're happening repeatedly, maybe that's part of a script that's trying to do something unusual.\n\nAlso, there's a \"py.exe\" and \"python.exe\" process. The Python process might be part of legitimate activity, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, that could be a red flag.\n\nNow, looking at the SDXHelper.exe again. The name isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a legitimate application, but I should check if it's known. If it's not, that could be a problem. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that it's loading system DLLs multiple times might be normal if it's a helper tool for some software.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll, urlmon.dll, which are part of the Windows system. However, if a process is loading these DLLs in a way that's not typical, it could be a sign of something malicious. But I need to see if there's any other unusual behavior.\n\nThe \"File created\" and \"File Delete\" events in the Temp directory by PowerShell might be part of a script that's being run. If the script is legitimate, that's fine. But if it's malicious, that's a problem. However, the filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might indicate that it's related to testing script policies, which could be part of normal administrative tasks.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the fact that they're loading various DLLs and creating\/deleting files might not be enough on their own. However, when combined with the SDXHelper.exe activity, it could be a sign of something suspicious. But I need to check if there's any other anomalies.\n\nAnother thing is the \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell and py.exe. These could be normal, but if the process is being accessed in a way that's not typical, it might be a problem.\n\nOverall, there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. The SDXHelper.exe is not a standard process, and the repeated loading of system DLLs might be worth investigating. The PowerShell activity, while common, has some elements that could be part of malicious behavior, like creating and deleting temporary files. However, without more context or additional indicators (like network activity, unexpected commands, etc.), it's hard to be certain. But given the presence of non-standard processes and the file operations, this might be worth flagging for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries contain a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious patterns** that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Unusual Process Behavior**\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`**:\n  - Loads legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `combase.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, `msvcrt.dll`) repeatedly.\n  - While loading system DLLs is common, **`SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process**. Its presence and repeated activity could indicate a third-party application or **malware** (e.g., a helper tool for a suspicious application or a dropper).\n  - **Red Flag**: No `command_line` field is provided for `SDXHelper.exe`, making it harder to determine its purpose or intent.\n\n---\n\n### **2. PowerShell Activity with Suspicious File Operations**\n- **File Creation\/Deletion**:\n  - A temporary file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest...`) is created and deleted in the `Temp` directory by PowerShell. This is common in script execution but could also be used to **hide malicious activity** (e.g., downloading payloads, executing commands, or cleaning logs).\n  - **Red Flag**: The filename includes `PSScriptPolicyTest`, which might relate to **script execution testing**, but could also be a **misleading name** to obfuscate malicious behavior.\n\n- **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events**:\n  - PowerShell processes trigger multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events, which are related to PowerShell's interaction with file systems, registry, etc. While normal, **frequent or unusual provider activity** could indicate **scripting or automation** that is probing the environment.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Python and `py.exe` Activity**\n- **`py.exe`**:\n  - Loads itself (`py.exe`) as a legitimate Python launcher, but the associated `python.exe` process is launched with a command line (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData...`). This is typical for Python scripts but could be **exploited** if the script is malicious.\n  - **Red Flag**: No `command_line` for `py.exe` is provided, making it harder to assess its intent.\n\n---\n\n### **4. \"Special Logon\" Event**\n- A **logon event with process `null`** is logged. This could be a **user logon** (e.g., interactive or remote), but the absence of process details raises questions. It might be a **normal event**, but could also indicate **unauthorized access** (e.g., if the logon is unexpected or unauthenticated).\n\n---\n\n### **5. \"Process Access\" Events**\n- Both **PowerShell** and **`py.exe`** trigger \"Process Access\" events. While this is normal for inter-process communication, it could also be **exploited** to inject code or monitor other processes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Likely Suspicious**\n- **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n  - Unusual process (`SDXHelper.exe`) with no clear purpose.\n  - PowerShell creating\/deleting temporary files (could be part of a **malicious script**).\n  - Missing `command_line` fields for critical processes (obfuscation).\n  - Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events (possible scripting or probing).\n\n- **Next Steps**:\n  1. **Correlate with network logs** to check for outbound connections (e.g., to C2 servers).\n  2. **Inspect the deleted file** (if possible) for malicious content (e.g., via file hashing or sandboxing).\n  3. **Verify the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe`** (e.g., check digital signatures, file reputation).\n  4. **Monitor for lateral movement** or privilege escalation via PowerShell or Python.\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict**\n**This activity is potentially suspicious and warrants further investigation**. While some behavior is normal (e.g., PowerShell script execution), the combination of non-standard processes, file operations, and missing metadata raises concerns about **malware or adversarial activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll look through each event.\n\nThe first four events are about python.exe loading various DLLs. The paths are all in the standard Python installation directory. That seems normal. Python often loads multiple DLLs as part of its execution, so these might be legitimate.\n\nThen there are two events about winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. The path is in the Downloads directory. Creating a new config file might be part of setting up the tool, but I should check if that's typical. However, creating a file in the Downloads folder isn't necessarily suspicious. Maybe the user is just installing or configuring winlogbeat.\n\nThe last event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is a system process that handles permissions for apps. Changing registry values could be normal, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, alone, this doesn't seem malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The Python events are standard. The winlogbeat file creation seems legitimate. The registry change by RuntimeBroker is normal for system processes. There's no indication of malicious activity here. All events are consistent with normal system operations. So, the classification is likely NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal system operations: Python process loading standard DLLs, Winlogbeat creating a temporary config file during setup, and RuntimeBroker updating registry values as part of its normal permissions management role. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
