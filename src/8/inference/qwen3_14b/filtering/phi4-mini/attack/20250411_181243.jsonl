{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with ProcessAccess. That's common, but not suspicious on its own. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info. But then there's another powershell.exe with a long command line that includes net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. That seems like someone is trying to gather a lot of system information. Commands like net user and get-localgroup could be used to find users and groups, which might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe with Registry value set events. Changing registry values could be part of persistence or configuration changes. Then there are ImageLoad events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are .NET framework components, so loading them might be normal, but if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThere's a File Delete event for a temporary PowerShell script. Deleting a script after execution is common in some attacks to avoid leaving traces. The same command line is repeated multiple times in Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events. That repetition might indicate that the script is being run multiple times or that there's some automation happening, which could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a net1.exe process. That's not a standard Windows executable; the correct one is net.exe. The presence of net1.exe could be a typo or a malicious executable trying to mimic a legitimate process. That's a red flag.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory is normal for logging, but the filename has a .new extension, which might be part of a configuration process. However, if the user didn't initiate this, it could be an indicator of something else.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands gathering system info, registry changes, loading .NET DLLs, deletion of temporary scripts, and the presence of a suspicious net1.exe. These activities combined suggest potential reconnaissance or an attempt to establish persistence. Even though some actions are normal, the combination and repetition of these events, along with the suspicious executable, make this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is high because the indicators point towards possible malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit several suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation, suggesting potential reconnaissance or malicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicion**\n1. **Reconnaissance via PowerShell**:\n   - **Command Line Activity**: The repeated execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line containing:\n     - `net user` and `net localgroup`: Enumerating user accounts and groups.\n     - `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, `dir`, and `ls C:\/Users`: Gathering detailed system and user information.\n     - **Purpose**: These commands are typical in **reconnaissance phases** of attacks, aiming to map the environment for further exploitation.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - **Registry Value Changes**: Multiple `Registry value set` events for `powershell.exe`. While not inherently malicious, such changes could indicate **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., modifying startup paths or registry keys).\n\n3. **Suspicious Executable**:\n   - **`net1.exe`**: This is **not a standard Windows utility** (correct executable is `net.exe`). Its presence and command (`net1 user`) suggest a **potential typo, spoofing, or malicious binary** mimicking legitimate tools.\n\n4. **File Deletion of Temporary Script**:\n   - **`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new`**: The deletion of a temporary file after execution is **common in stealthy attacks** to avoid leaving evidence.\n\n5. **.NET DLL Loading**:\n   - **`mscoree.dll`, `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`**: These are core .NET components. While normal in .NET applications, their loading in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity could indicate **malicious payload execution** (e.g., via PowerShell-based .NET assemblies).\n\n6. **Repeated Lifecycle Events**:\n   - **`Provider Lifecycle` and `Engine Lifecycle`** events for the same PowerShell command line suggest **automation or persistence**, possibly tied to a script or tool being repeatedly triggered.\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Hypothesis**\n- **Malicious Actor Activity**: The logs align with **initial access\/reconnaissance** phases of an attack, possibly involving:\n  - **PowerShell-based exploitation** (e.g., using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `IEX` to download and execute payloads).\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (registry changes, scheduled tasks).\n  - **Data exfiltration** (via `net user` or other commands).\n\n- **Possible Tools**: The presence of `winlogbeat` (a log shipper) and the `.yml.new` file might indicate **log tampering or configuration changes** by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Check for additional PowerShell activity, network traffic (e.g., outbound connections to C2 servers), or file modifications in the same directory.\n\n2. **Investigate `net1.exe`**:\n   - Verify the legitimacy of the executable using file integrity checks (e.g., hash comparison with known good binaries).\n\n3. **Analyze PowerShell Script**:\n   - If the deleted `.yml.new` file was part of a malicious script, reconstruct it using memory forensics or logs.\n\n4. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Look for subsequent use of `net.exe` or other tools to exploit enumerated user credentials.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combination of **reconnaissance commands, registry changes, suspicious executables, and stealthy file deletion** indicates a **high likelihood of malicious activity**. This batch of logs is **definitely interesting for investigation** and should be prioritized for deeper analysis. \n\n**Confidence Level**: **High** (multiple overlapping suspicious indicators)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a PowerShell command that's running several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, and listing directories in C:\\Users. That seems suspicious because it's gathering a lot of user and group information, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for PowerShell processes being accessed and files created. One file is created in the Downloads folder named 'elemento_logico.txt', and another in AppData. Not sure what's in those files, but creating files in user directories might be normal, but combined with other activities, it could be part of malicious activity.\n\nThere's also a 'net1.exe' process, which might be a typo or a malicious binary. The presence of 'net1.exe' instead of 'net.exe' could indicate an attempt to disguise the process. Also, the command line for net1.exe is similar to the legitimate 'net localgroup' command, which might be part of enumerating user groups.\n\nSeveral registry value set events involving PowerShell and other processes like conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and svchost.exe. Changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior.\n\nThe 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' entries loading urlmon.dll seem normal, but if they're part of a larger pattern, maybe not. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing and creating files, along with the registry changes, suggests someone is trying to manipulate the system.\n\nThe user 'fiddelis' is mentioned in the file paths. If this is a legitimate user, maybe it's just normal activity. But the combination of all these events—enumeration of users, groups, creating files, registry changes—raises a red flag. It's possible this is a script trying to gather information and set up persistence. However, without more context, like known good behavior of the user, it's hard to say. But given the activities, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell commands enumerating system users, groups, and files (e.g., 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'ls C:\/Users'), which are typical of reconnaissance activities.
