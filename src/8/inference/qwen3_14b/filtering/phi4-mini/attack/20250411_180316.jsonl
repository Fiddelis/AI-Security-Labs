The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, Calculator.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and notepad.exe. Some of these are common system processes, but others like powershell.exe and WMIC.exe can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nNow, checking the winlog tasks. There are several \"Registry value set\" events, which might be normal, but when combined with other activities, could indicate changes to system settings. The \"Process accessed\" events might be benign, but if they're part of a larger pattern, they could be suspicious.\n\nOne event stands out: the cmd.exe process with the command line \"wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\". That command is attempting to delete processes named notepad.exe. That's unusual and could be part of a malicious activity, like trying to terminate a process that's being used for something else. Also, there's a WMIC.exe process that's loading DLLs from system directories, which might be normal, but combined with the deletion command, it's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal, but the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which could be a sign of someone manually setting it up, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nHowever, the key suspicious activity here is the use of WMIC and cmd.exe to delete processes. This kind of behavior is often seen in malware trying to clean up after itself or prevent analysis. The combination of multiple registry changes and process deletions could indicate an attempt to modify system settings or remove evidence.\n\nI should also check if there are any other indicators. The Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as that's a system DLL. The powershell.exe events are common, but without specific commands, they might not be suspicious on their own. However, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate monitoring or interaction with other processes.\n\nPutting it all together, the most concerning event is the cmd.exe command to delete notepad.exe processes. This, along with the WMIC activities, suggests potential malicious behavior. While some events are normal system activities, the combination here points towards something that needs further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) 'cmd.exe' executing 'wmic process where name=\\\\'notepad.exe\\\\' delete' to terminate processes, 2) 'WMIC.exe' loading DLLs from system directories (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) which could indicate evasion techniques, 3) repeated 'Registry value set' events that may indicate configuration changes.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's a lot of chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and schtasks.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, and Process Create. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the command line in one of the entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That looks like someone is replacing the sethc.exe file, which is a known attack vector. Attackers often replace sethc.exe with a malicious file, like a backdoor, and then use it to gain persistence. \n\nAnother suspicious line is \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". This is deleting a scheduled task named \"win32times\". Deleting a task could be part of cleaning up after an attack, but it's not inherently malicious. However, when combined with other activities, it might be part of a larger scheme.\n\nThere's also a mention of \"taskschd.dll\" being loaded, which is a legitimate Windows file, but the presence of multiple registry changes and process accesses might indicate something's wrong. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry modifications could be part of an attempt to modify system settings or install malware.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries have Image loaded events with a file path related to Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if there's a lot of such events, it could indicate something's wrong. However, in this case, there's only one such event, so maybe it's just a regular process.\n\nThe repeated Process accessed events for powershell.exe might indicate that an attacker is trying to access or manipulate processes, which is suspicious. Also, the multiple Process Create events for cmd.exe and schtasks.exe could be part of an attempt to execute commands or set up scheduled tasks.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant red flag is the replacement of sethc.exe. That's a classic attack technique. Even though there are other suspicious activities, the presence of that specific command line makes this batch worth investigating.

So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity around powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. The winlog tasks include things like Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete. \n\nHmm, the fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe creating and deleting files in the Temp directory might be a red flag. For example, the File created event at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1' followed by its deletion could indicate temporary script execution, which is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. But combined with other events, maybe there's something more.\n\nAlso, the Image loaded events point to .dll files like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but if there's unexpected loading, it might be a sign of something. However, the presence of 'whoami.exe' which is a legitimate tool for checking user context, but if used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}'. These might be related to the logging or monitoring tools, but if they're appearing multiple times, maybe indicating some kind of persistent activity or testing.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear signs of malware or unauthorized access. The activities seem to be within normal system operations, like script execution, registry changes, and file operations. The use of PowerShell is common in both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities, but without more context like unusual network activity, unexpected user behavior, or other anomalies, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nBut considering the combination of multiple PowerShell events, file creation and deletion, and registry changes, even if they are legitimate, they might warrant further investigation. The classification here might be \"INTERESTING\" because the volume and types of events could indicate potential malicious activity, but the confidence isn't extremely high since some of these activities are normal.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several PowerShell.exe processes. That's common, but when combined with other events, it might be suspicious. Let me check the tasks associated with them. There's a File created event in the user's AppData directory, which could be normal, but maybe not. Then there are registry value set events. However, the most concerning part is the Image loaded events. They mention loading DLLs like MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. Wait, that's a legitimate file, but why is it being loaded here? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but sometimes attackers might use similar names.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple PowerShell commands that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd. They have paths like \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" suggests that the script is trying to navigate up directories, which might be an attempt to access files outside the intended directory. This could be a sign of path traversal attacks or trying to execute scripts from unexpected locations.\n\nAlso, there are several instances of the \"Provider Lifecycle\" task with PowerShell commands that check for the existence of .bat files. These commands are structured similarly, each checking a different path. This repetition might indicate an automated script trying to locate and execute certain files, which could be part of a malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is the loading of .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so their presence is normal during PowerShell execution, especially if scripts are using .NET classes. However, combined with the other events, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe user's AppData directory having a file created by PowerShell could be part of a legitimate process, like temporary files. However, the repeated checks for .bat files and the use of '..' in the paths might be red flags. It's possible that the attacker is trying to execute a script from a different directory, possibly to bypass security measures.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry value set events might indicate changes to the system's configuration, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of checking for .bat files with suspicious paths, creating files in temporary directories, and loading legitimate DLLs might not be entirely malicious, but the patterns suggest potential malicious activity. The repetition and the path traversal attempts are concerning. Therefore, this batch of events is worth investigating further to determine if it's part of a legitimate process or a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents **multiple indicators of potential malicious activity**, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Script Checks for `.bat` Files**  \n   - **Example**:  \n     ```powershell\n     if (Test-Path \"C:\\entrada_principal\\unidade_auxiliar\\..\\elemento_geral\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }\n     ```\n   - **Path Traversal**: The use of `..\\` in paths (e.g., `..\\elemento_geral\\...`) suggests **attempts to traverse directories**, potentially to access files outside the intended scope (e.g., bypassing restrictions or probing for hidden scripts).  \n   - **Automation**: The repetitive structure of these checks (10+ instances) implies **automated probing** for specific `.bat` files, which could indicate **script execution attempts** or **reconnaissance** for payloads.\n\n2. **File Creation in User-Specific Temp Directories**  \n   - A file is created in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1`.  \n   - **Context**: PowerShell often uses temp directories for transient scripts, but the filename (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...`) suggests **script execution** under the guise of a \"policy test\" (a potential evasion tactic).  \n\n3. **Loading of .NET Runtime DLLs**  \n   - **Files**:  \n     - `mscoree.dll` (managed execution engine)  \n     - `mscoreei.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll` (.NET runtime components)  \n   - **Implication**: These are **legitimate components** of .NET, but their loading in conjunction with the above activities could indicate **scripting or payload execution** using .NET assemblies.\n\n4. **Registry Modifications**  \n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events involving `powershell.exe`.  \n   - **Potential Concern**: Registry changes could be part of **persistence mechanisms** (e.g., adding startup entries or modifying execution policies).\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Context**\n- **Legitimate Scenarios**:  \n  - PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, and .NET DLLs are standard.  \n  - Temp file creation and registry tweaks are normal in some administrative workflows.  \n\n- **Malicious Indicators**:  \n  - **Path Traversal**: Suggests **evasion of restrictions** (e.g., bypassing script block logging or execution policies).  \n  - **Repetitive Script Checks**: Could be **probing for hidden scripts** or **checking for the presence of malicious payloads**.  \n  - **Unusual File Names**: `__PSScriptPolicyTest_...` may mimic system-generated files to avoid detection.  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Investigation**\n1. **Analyze the Created Script File**:  \n   - Examine the contents of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1` for obfuscation, malicious commands, or references to external resources.\n\n2. **Correlate with Other Logs**:  \n   - Check for **network activity** (e.g., outbound connections to suspicious IPs\/domains) or **process injections** during these events.  \n   - Investigate **user behavior** (e.g., was `fiddelis` a legitimate user? Are there other accounts with similar activity?).\n\n3. **Check for PowerShell Execution Policy Bypass**:  \n   - The filename suggests a potential attempt to **bypass execution policies** (e.g., using `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`).\n\n4. **Monitor for Persistence**:  \n   - Investigate registry changes for **startup entries**, **scheduled tasks**, or **group policy modifications**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events exhibit **highly suspicious patterns** consistent with **malicious activity**, including **path traversal**, **script probing**, and **potential persistence mechanisms**. While not definitive proof of compromise, this warrants **immediate investigation** to confirm or rule out adversarial activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe is deleting a file in the Temp directory. That's a common place for temporary files, so maybe not too suspicious on its own. But then the next entry is powershell.exe creating a file in Downloads. Still, that's a normal activity unless there's something else.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. But the file field is None here. However, there are several of these, but maybe that's just normal behavior. But wait, there's a lot of them—eight entries of chrome.exe doing registry value sets. That might be a red flag. However, Chrome sometimes modifies the registry for updates or settings, so maybe not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that checks if certain files exist. The paths here are a bit odd, like \"C:\\\\modulo_ativo\\\\objeto_ativo\\\\..\\\\pacote_temporario\\\\objeto_temporario_script.bat\". The use of \"..\" might indicate that the script is trying to navigate up directories, which could be a sign of trying to access parent directories, but not sure yet.\n\nAnother entry shows powershell.exe creating a file in StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles, so maybe legitimate. But then there's an event where powershell.exe is creating a file with a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content. The command line here is constructing a batch file and writing \"dir\" into it. That seems benign, but maybe part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoaded events for various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That's normal, as those are legitimate system components. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but could also be indicative of malicious code loading additional components.\n\nNow, looking for patterns. The repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might be normal, but the combination with the PowerShell activities is interesting. The creation of files in temporary directories and the use of commands that check for existence of files could be part of an attack trying to deploy or execute scripts.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the PowerShell commands are using paths that have multiple directory traversals (like ..\\), which could be an attempt to access files outside the intended directory. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious.\n\nThe presence of multiple file creations and deletions, combined with registry changes, might indicate some form of persistent mechanism or data exfiltration. But again, without more evidence, it's not conclusive.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are several events that could be considered unusual or potentially malicious, even if individually they might be normal, when taken together they form a pattern that might warrant further investigation. For example, creating files in specific locations, modifying registry entries, and loading various DLLs could be part of a larger attack.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while none of the individual events are definitively malicious, the combination of multiple suspicious activities (file creation\/deletion, registry changes, image loading) might indicate that this batch is worth looking into further. Therefore, the answer would be that it's interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs contains a mix of normal system activities and potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **File Creation\/Deletion:** \n     - PowerShell processes are creating\/deleting files in temporary directories (`Temp`, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) and writing content to batch files (e.g., `dir`). While some of these could be legitimate, the use of `..` in file paths (e.g., `modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo..\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`) suggests potential directory traversal or attempts to access parent directories, which may warrant scrutiny.\n   - **Command-Line Scripts:** \n     - A PowerShell process executes a command that creates a batch file and writes `dir` to it. This could be benign (e.g., testing), but the context (e.g., if part of a chain of commands) might indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - **Chrome.exe Activity:** \n     - Multiple entries show `chrome.exe` modifying registry values. While Chrome occasionally updates its registry settings, the repetition (8 events) could indicate unusual behavior, such as persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.\n\n3. **Image Load Events:**\n   - **Legitimate DLLs:** \n     - PowerShell loads several legitimate system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, `MpOAV.dll` from Windows Defender). These are normal for .NET operations and antivirus components.\n   - **Potential Red Flags:** \n     - The frequency of `ImageLoad` events might indicate unusual process behavior, though this alone is not conclusive.\n\n4. **Process Access:**\n   - A `ProcessAccess` event for PowerShell could indicate interaction with other processes, which may be normal or part of malicious activity (e.g., injecting code).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** \n  - While individual events (e.g., file creation, registry changes) are common in legitimate scenarios, the **combination** of multiple PowerShell activities, directory traversal in file paths, and repeated registry modifications by `chrome.exe` raises concerns.\n  - The absence of clear malicious payloads (e.g., execution of `dir` alone is benign) means this is not a high-priority alert but **merits further investigation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with Other Logs:**\n   - Check for additional events (e.g., network activity, unauthorized access) that might contextualize these actions.\n   - Investigate the purpose of the batch files created (e.g., `dir` could be a placeholder for more complex commands).\n\n2. **Monitor User Behavior:**\n   - Determine if the user account executing these actions has elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.\n\n3. **Check for Malware Signatures:**\n   - Scan the involved processes (e.g., PowerShell scripts, `chrome.exe`) for malware indicators (e.g., YARA rules, hash analysis).\n\n4. **Review System Integrity:**\n   - Verify the integrity of system files and the Windows Defender module (`MpOAV.dll`) to ensure no tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs is **interesting for investigation** due to the combination of PowerShell activities, unusual file paths, and repeated registry changes. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the pattern suggests the need for deeper analysis to rule out potential threats."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are related to PowerShell processes. There are several entries where PowerShell is creating files and writing content to them. For example, the command lines show the use of New-Item and Set-Content commands, which are used to create files and write data. The paths mentioned are all over the system, some in typical locations like AppData, others in more system-like directories. \n\nNow, the key thing here is that PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it's also a common tool for attackers. The fact that there are multiple file creations and modifications might be suspicious. However, I need to check if there's any pattern that indicates malicious activity.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some files are created in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but when combined with other actions, it could be a red flag. Also, there are events related to registry value changes and image loading, which might be normal, but again, need to check for anomalies.\n\nWait, looking at the command lines again, the content being written to the files is \"dir\". That's a simple command to list directory contents. Maybe the attacker is creating scripts that perform basic commands, but why so many? The repetition of creating files with \"dir\" might be part of a larger plan, like setting up a backdoor or exfiltrating data. However, without seeing the actual execution of these scripts or any network activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlso, there's a file created in the Users directory and then deleted, which could be part of a script testing or temporary operation. The fact that the same user (fiddelis) is involved in multiple events might be relevant, but unless there's a known bad actor associated with that user, it's hard to say.\n\nThe registry events and image loads are normal for PowerShell, but if they're part of a larger pattern, like persistence mechanisms or injecting code, that would be concerning. However, the logs provided don't show any direct evidence of that.\n\nSo, the main points are: multiple PowerShell-driven file creations, use of Temp directories, and repetitive commands. While these could be part of legitimate activities, the volume and the nature of the commands might indicate something more. However, without more context like network traffic, user behavior analysis, or correlation with known threats, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the answer is that this is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. The repetition and the use of PowerShell for creating multiple files could be indicative of malicious activity, but it's not conclusive on its own. Therefore, the classification should be \"interesting for investigation\" as there are signs that might point to a potential threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs exhibit patterns that warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) and suspicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell File Creation**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) are creating files across the system using `New-Item` and `Set-Content` commands. Examples include:\n     - `C:\\componente_geral\\estrutura_comum\\objeto_comum_script.bat`\n     - `C:\\modulo_comum\\objeto_base\\..\\.entrada_base\\objeto_temporario_script.bat`\n   - The content written to these files is simple commands like `dir`, which could be part of a larger script or a test. However, the **volume and repetition** of such actions are unusual for benign use cases.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Paths**:\n   - Files are created in both **user-specific directories** (e.g., `AppData`) and **system directories** (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32`). This duality may indicate attempts to blend legitimate and malicious activity.\n\n3. **Registry and Image Load Events**:\n   - Events like `Registry value set` and `Image loaded` (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`) are normal for PowerShell but could also be part of **persistence mechanisms** or **code injection** if correlated with other anomalies (not visible here).\n\n4. **File Creation and Deletion**:\n   - A temporary file (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is created and later deleted, which may be part of a **script testing** or **cleanup routine** but could also mask malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Threats**\n- **Script-Based Attacks**: The use of PowerShell to create and execute scripts (`dir`, `Test-Path`) could be part of **initial access**, **reconnaissance**, or **command-and-control (C2)** communication.\n- **Persistence**: Registry modifications and file creation in system directories may indicate attempts to **establish persistence**.\n- **Lateral Movement**: The repetitive nature of file creation might be part of **preparing for lateral movement** or **deploying payloads**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Is Interesting for Investigation**\n- **Unusual Volume of PowerShell Activity**: PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but **high-frequency file creation** without clear business justification is suspicious.\n- **Lack of Context**: No network activity, user behavior, or correlation with known threats is provided, making it difficult to confirm benignity.\n- **Potential for Obfuscation**: The use of `dir` and `Test-Path` could be a **smokescreen** for more隐蔽 operations (e.g., exfiltration, privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Correlate with Network Logs**: Check for outgoing connections to suspicious IPs or domains.\n2. **Analyze File Contents**: Inspect the created `.bat` files for obfuscated commands or payloads.\n3. **User Behavior Analysis**: Investigate the user `fiddelis` for anomalies (e.g., unusual login times, permissions).\n4. **Check for Persistence**: Audit registry keys and startup locations for unauthorized entries.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** that requires further investigation. While not definitively malicious, the **repetitive PowerShell use**, **file creation in sensitive directories**, and **lack of clear purpose** justify a deeper dive into logs and system state."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what each event is about.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell processes running commands that check if certain batch files exist. The command lines are similar, using Test-Path to check for the existence of a .bat file in various paths. If the file exists, it exits with 0, else 1. These are all under the 'Provider Lifecycle' task in winlog. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Why would someone check for these specific batch files? Maybe they're part of a setup or installation process, but the paths look a bit random. Also, the filenames have patterns like \"pacote_temporario_script.bat\" which might be temporary scripts. But why so many of them?\n\nThen there are other events related to file creation and deletion, like a temporary PowerShell script being created and then deleted. That's common in scripts that run and clean up after themselves. But then there's a Pipe Created event, which might be normal, but not necessarily suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a standard command to get user information. Not suspicious on its own. However, the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific batch files in non-standard directories might be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple such checks are happening could indicate that someone is trying to determine if certain files exist, possibly as part of a larger operation, like checking for the presence of a payload or a backdoor.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the paths mentioned in the Test-Path commands have a pattern: they use \"..\\\" to navigate up directories. For example, \"C:\\\\objeto_logico\\\\elemento_logico\\\\..\\\\elemento_base\\\\pacote_temporario_script.bat\". The use of '..' might be an attempt to reference files in parent directories, which could be a way to obfuscate the actual path or to access files that shouldn't be accessible. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes with similar commands might be part of a script that's being run in a way that's trying to avoid detection. But again, this could be part of a legitimate process if, say, the user is running a complex automation task.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are so many of these Test-Path commands in different directories without clear purpose might be suspicious. It's possible that this is part of a malicious activity where the attacker is checking for the existence of certain files before proceeding with further steps, like executing a payload or checking for a reverse shell.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of file creation and deletion events, along with the registry and process access events, might indicate that the system is being probed or that some kind of setup is being attempted. But I need to be careful here. Without more context, like the user's environment or the system's normal behavior, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn summary, the key points are the repeated PowerShell commands checking for specific batch files in non-standard paths, the use of '..' in the paths, and the multiple related events. These could be signs of malicious activity, but they might also be part of a legitimate process. However, given the lack of clear purpose and the repetitive nature, it's leaning towards being suspicious and warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity, with the following key observations:\n\n### **Normal Activity**\n- **Legitimate PowerShell usage**: Commands like `whoami.exe` and temporary script creation\/deletion are common in automation or user-initiated tasks.\n- **File operations**: Creation\/deletion of temporary files (e.g., `.yml.new`, `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) aligns with typical PowerShell behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell `Test-Path` Checks**:\n   - **Frequency**: Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\[path]\\*.bat\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }`.\n   - **Path Patterns**: \n     - Paths include obfuscated or non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\objeto_logico\\elemento_logico\\..\\elemento_base\\pacote_temporario_script.bat`).\n     - Use of `..` to navigate parent directories may indicate obfuscation or attempts to access files in unexpected locations.\n   - **Purpose**: These checks could be probing for the existence of specific files (e.g., payloads, backdoors, or execution wrappers) before proceeding with further actions.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Legitimacy**:\n   - The repeated checks for `.bat` files in non-standard paths without clear context (e.g., no associated execution of these files) raise concerns. This could indicate:\n     - **Preparation for lateral movement** (e.g., checking for existing tools).\n     - **Payload deployment** (e.g., verifying if a malicious file exists before execution).\n     - **Obfuscation** (e.g., hiding the true intent of the script).\n\n3. **Registry\/Process Access Events**:\n   - Events like `Registry value set` and `Process accessed` (without clear context) may hint at attempts to modify system behavior or escalate privileges.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `whoami.exe`, temporary file creation) is benign, the **repetitive `Test-Path` checks** in obfuscated paths and the **absence of clear purpose** for these operations warrant further investigation. This could indicate:\n- **Malicious reconnaissance** (e.g., checking for the presence of tools or files).\n- **Early stages of an attack** (e.g., probing for vulnerabilities or setup conditions).\n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Correlate these events with system logs, user activity, and network traffic.\n- Check for the existence of files referenced in the `Test-Path` commands.\n- Monitor for subsequent execution of identified `.bat` files or unusual process behavior."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking through the entries, most of them are related to PowerShell processes. There's a lot of 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded' events. Some of the command lines involve checking if certain files exist and then exiting with 0 or 1. For example, the first event checks if a specific executable exists in a directory. These checks might be part of normal operations, but I should be cautious.\n\nNow, the files mentioned in the 'Image loaded' events include system DLLs like mscoree.dll and MpClient.dll. That's part of Windows, so maybe legitimate. However, the paths where files are created, like in the Temp directory, could be a red flag. The temporary files created and then deleted might be part of normal script execution, but if they're being used to execute malicious code, that's a problem.\n\nI notice that some of the PowerShell commands are testing for the existence of specific executables in various directories. This pattern might be an indicator of an attacker checking for the presence of certain files, perhaps to determine if a payload is already present or to check for conditions before executing further steps. However, without more context, like network activity or unexpected processes, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nThere's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a normal command, and a 'cmd.exe' process checking for a file in the temp directory. These could be part of legitimate scripts or user activities. But the repetition of PowerShell events with similar patterns might suggest something automated or scripted.\n\nThe key thing here is that while some of these events could be part of normal system operations, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes checking for specific files, along with file creation and deletion in temporary directories, might indicate a potential security risk. However, without additional indicators like unexpected network connections, unusual registry changes, or unauthorized access, it's not definitive.\n\nI should also consider the confidence level. Since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, like suspicious network traffic or known bad files, the confidence isn't extremely high. But the pattern is enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification would be 'INTERESTING' with a moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6. The justification would be the repeated PowerShell checks and temporary file manipulations that could be part of a larger attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events exhibits a pattern of **frequent PowerShell activity** involving **file existence checks**, **temporary file creation\/deletion**, and **registry modifications**. While not definitively malicious, these behaviors warrant further investigation due to potential indicators of **script-based attacks** or **suspicious automation**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **PowerShell File Existence Checks**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `IF EXIST [path] ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` (e.g., in `cmd.exe` and PowerShell). This could indicate **precondition checks** for payloads, **environment validation**, or **exploitation attempts** (e.g., checking for the presence of tools like `whoami.exe` or specific files).\n\n2. **Temporary File Activity**:\n   - Files are created and deleted in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`). This is common in legitimate scripts but can also be used to **hide malicious payloads** or **execute code in memory**.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Frequent `Registry value set` events (e.g., via PowerShell) may indicate **configuration changes**, **persistence mechanisms**, or **tampering** with system settings.\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious**:\n   - Some activity (e.g., `whoami.exe`, system DLLs like `mscoree.dll`) is normal. However, the **repetition of PowerShell commands** and **file checks** in non-standard paths raises concerns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Classification**: `INTERESTING` (requires deeper analysis).\n- **Confidence**: **0.6** (moderate). The activity is not overtly malicious but shows patterns consistent with **script-based attacks** or **suspicious automation**. Further investigation (e.g., checking for network traffic, unauthorized access, or unexpected binaries) is recommended.\n\n### Example Justification:\n> The repeated use of PowerShell to check for specific files, combined with temporary file creation and registry modifications, suggests potential for **malicious scripting** or **suspicious automation**. While not conclusive, these behaviors align with attack patterns observed in **initial access** or **lateral movement** phases."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events are about PowerShell and whoami.exe being executed. The whoami.exe is a legitimate command to check user privileges, so that's normal. But the PowerShell activity is more frequent. Let me check the command lines.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell commands, they all seem to be checking if certain files exist using Test-Path, then exiting with 0 or 1. That's a common technique in scripts to check for file presence. But why so many of them? Also, the paths mentioned are all in different directories, like C:\\registro_principal, C:\\elemento_principal, etc. These don't look like standard system paths. Maybe they're checking for files that are part of some custom application or maybe malicious files?\n\nWait, there's also an event where a file is created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate script execution that's trying to avoid leaving traces. However, the name suggests it's related to PowerShell script policy testing, which could be legitimate, like during a security scan or configuration.\n\nAnother thing is the Image Load events. There's a mention of mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of the .NET framework, so that's normal. The MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender, which is also legitimate. So those are probably just normal process loading.\n\nBut the repeated Test-Path commands in various paths might be part of a larger script that's checking for the presence of certain files, maybe to determine the environment or to locate resources. However, if these paths are arbitrary or not part of the user's normal system, that could be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that there are multiple such commands might indicate automated checks, possibly part of a legitimate application or maybe a script that's part of a larger attack.\n\nAlso, the Process Access events are common, but the combination with the Test-Path commands might indicate that the PowerShell process is being accessed multiple times, which could be normal for scripts, but again, depends on the context.\n\nConsidering all this, the most suspicious part is the repeated Test-Path commands in non-standard paths. However, since the user hasn't provided additional context, like whether these are part of known good processes or if there are other indicators of compromise, it's a bit ambiguous. But in the absence of more information, the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for files in various locations might be worth investigating further. So I'd lean towards this being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows a mix of normal system activity and potentially suspicious patterns. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Frequent PowerShell Activity:**\n   - **Test-Path Commands:** Multiple PowerShell processes execute `Test-Path` checks on non-standard, seemingly arbitrary file paths (e.g., `C:\\registro_principal`, `C:\\unidade_base`, etc.). These checks often return exit codes (`0` or `1`) but do not explicitly indicate malicious intent. However, the **volume and variety of paths** raise questions about their purpose (e.g., probing for sensitive files, checking for presence of payloads, or environment reconnaissance).\n\n2. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1`) is created in the `Temp` directory and immediately deleted. While this could be part of legitimate script execution (e.g., policy testing or cleanup), the **ephemeral nature** of the file might indicate an attempt to avoid leaving forensic traces.\n\n3. **Legitimate System Components:**\n   - **Image Loads:** References to `mscoree.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, and `MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender) are normal and expected in a Windows environment.\n   - **File Operations:** File creation\/deletion and pipe events are consistent with routine script execution.\n\n### **Suspicious Indicators:**\n- **Unusual File Paths:** The `Test-Path` commands target directories with non-standard names (e.g., `C:\\estrutura_temporario`, `C:\\tarefa_padrao`). These may not align with typical user or application directories, suggesting potential **environment probing** or **custom attack infrastructure**.\n- **Lack of Clear Purpose:** The absence of clear context (e.g., user-initiated scripts, known applications) for the PowerShell activity and temporary file operations could signal **unauthorized or automated behavior**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis activity is **worth further investigation** due to the combination of:\n- **Repetitive, non-standard file checks** via PowerShell.\n- **Ephemeral script file operations** in temporary directories.\n- The **absence of obvious benign context** for these actions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Correlate these logs with **user activity timelines**, **process parentage**, and **network behavior** to determine if the PowerShell processes are linked to legitimate workflows or external interactions.\n- Check for **unusual permissions** or **unregistered software** associated with the directories being probed.\n- Monitor for **follow-on actions** (e.g., data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms) that might not be evident in this log snippet."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. That's common, but sometimes it can be a red flag. The first event mentions Image loaded for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That might be normal, but I should check if there's anything suspicious about it.\n\nThen there's a File created in the user's AppData folder. The name is StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Not sure if that's normal. Maybe a legitimate file, but sometimes attackers create files in such locations.\n\nNext, several Registry value set and Process accessed events. These could be part of normal operations, but if combined with other events, they might indicate something. Then there's a whoami.exe process, which is a standard tool, but it's just checking the user, so probably benign.\n\nLooking at the command lines for PowerShell, they all seem to be checking if a certain path exists and exiting with 0 or 1. The paths all end with Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Wait, Get-Keystrokes sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. Even though the commands are just checking existence, the presence of such a script name is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of these checks in different directories. The fact that they're checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various locations might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate a keystlogging script, which is a red flag. Also, the repeated PowerShell processes accessing the registry and files could be part of setting up persistence or exfiltrating data.\n\nAdditionally, the image loaded events include some .NET DLLs, which might be part of legitimate processes, but combined with the other activities, it's a bit concerning. The file creation and deletion in the Temp folder might be part of cleaning up after some operations.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of multiple PowerShell commands checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script, along with file and registry activity, suggests potential malicious behavior. Even though some events are normal, the combination here points to something that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate **potential malicious activity** that warrants investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Suspicious Indicators:\n1. **Repeated Checks for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands like `if (Test-Path \"C:\\...\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }`.\n   - **`Get-Keystrokes.ps1`** is a **common name for keystlogging malware**, which captures user input (e.g., passwords, credentials). The fact that the script is being actively searched for across multiple directories suggests **malicious intent** (e.g., locating or deploying a keystlogger).\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Folder**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted. This could be an attempt to **execute or hide malicious code** temporarily.\n\n3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Frequent **`ProcessCreate`**, **`ProcessAccess`**, and **`ImageLoad`** events involving PowerShell and .NET DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`) may indicate **code injection** or **exploitation** (e.g., using PowerShell for payload delivery).\n\n4. **Registry and File Manipulation**:\n   - Multiple **`FileCreate`**, **`FileDelete`**, and **`Registry`** events could signal **persistence mechanisms** or **data exfiltration**.\n\n5. **Windows Defender DLLs**:\n   - While `MpClient.dll` and `MpOAV.dll` are legitimate Defender components, their loading in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity could indicate **tampering** or **bypassing security software**.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **High Risk**: The repeated search for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and PowerShell's use for file manipulation strongly suggest **malware deployment** or **data theft**.\n- **Possible Attack Vectors**: Credential harvesting via keystlogging, persistence via registry\/file changes, or exploitation of PowerShell for lateral movement.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. **Isolate the Host**: If this is a real system, isolate it from the network to prevent data exfiltration.\n2. **Check for `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`**: Search all directories for the script and analyze its contents.\n3. **Monitor PowerShell Activity**: Use tools like **PowerShell logging** or **EDR solutions** to track further suspicious commands.\n4. **Scan for Malware**: Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/endpoint detection tools.\n5. **Review User Activity**: Check if the user (`fiddelis`) has elevated privileges or unusual access patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logs exhibit **strong indicators of compromise (IoCs)**, particularly the repeated attempt to locate a keystlogging script. This requires **urgent investigation** to determine if malware is present and to mitigate risks."}

That's common, but sometimes it's used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. There are a couple of instances where PowerShell is running a script check, like testing if a certain .ps1 file exists. The paths mentioned are \"C:\\\\tarefa_temporario...\" and \"C:\\\\unidade_logico...\". These don't look like standard paths. Maybe they're trying to access scripts in non-standard directories, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal, but I should note that. However, the other events involve multiple PowerShell processes with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' tasks. That could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or access processes they shouldn't.\n\nAlso, there are several network connections from chrome.exe. That's normal for browsing, but if there are a lot of DNS queries and connections, maybe it's communicating with malicious servers. However, without more info on the destinations, it's hard to tell. The presence of 'Image loaded' events for urlmon.dll is normal too, as that's part of Internet Explorer.\n\nThe key points here are the PowerShell script checks in unusual paths and the multiple process accesses. The justification for being interesting would be the combination of these events, suggesting possible reconnaissance or setup of malicious activity.

Then there are several powershell.exe processes. The command lines show things like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse', which are just listing files recursively. That's common in PowerShell scripts, but maybe not harmful by itself.\n\nBut wait, looking at the image loaded events, there are several DLLs from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal for PowerShell to load those, so maybe not an issue. However, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory.

Maybe a red flag if it's unexpected.\n\nAlso, there's a Pipe Created event, which might be normal, but combined with other events? The repeated Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks might indicate some automated process. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes accessing the registry and creating files could be part of legitimate activities, like script execution or configuration changes.\n\nBut then, looking at the confidence: the events don't show any clear malicious activity.
