So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file called objeto_temporario.txt in the Downloads folder. That's a temporary file, maybe not too bad, but let's keep that in mind.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome doing that isn't unusual, but repeated registry changes might be a red flag. However, since it's chrome, maybe it's just normal operations. Still, multiple entries could indicate something.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate tool to check user identity, so probably not malicious. But then there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to a temp file. That script name sounds like it could be keylogging, which is definitely malicious. The log path is in the TEMP directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files.\n\nLooking further, there are several image loads related to .NET assemblies. Those are normal for PowerShell scripts, but when combined with the keystroke logging script, it's concerning. Also, the multiple instances of the same script path in different directories might be an attempt to obfuscate the location.\n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp folder. That's a common tactic to avoid leaving evidence. The Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 suggests keylogging, which is malicious. The creation and deletion of temp files, along with multiple registry changes and image loads, indicate suspicious activity. Even though some processes like chrome and whoami are legitimate, the combination here points to potential malware activity. So, this batch is interesting and needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') that log keystrokes to temporary files, combined with file creation\/deletion in temp directories and repeated registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each event to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a PowerShell command executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is logging keystrokes to a temporary file. That seems suspicious because keystroke logging is often associated with malware or keyloggers. The path mentioned is C:\\elemento_base\\unidade_temporario\\tarefa_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that it's writing to $env:TEMP\\key.log might be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are several entries about ImageLoaded for PowerShell and Urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so that might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger pattern. Then there's a file created in the PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive, which might be benign, but again, depends on context.\n\nAnother event mentions a registry value set by PowerShell and conhost.exe. Registry changes can be part of malware behavior, especially if they're modifying startup entries or other critical keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nThe seventh event is another PowerShell command running Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from a different path: C:\\tarefa_base\\entrada_ativo\\entrada_temporario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The same script name appearing twice from different directories might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the source or multiple instances of the same malicious activity.\n\nThe eighth event is a bit different: the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This could be a remote execution, which is a common attack vector. The fact that the process is None might mean the event is logged differently, but the remote command execution is concerning.\n\nOther events involve winlogbeat.exe creating files, which is a log shipper. Those might be normal if it's part of legitimate monitoring, but if there's no prior context, they could be part of data exfiltration. However, the presence of multiple file creations by PowerShell and svchost.exe might be normal system activity, but combined with the keystroke logging scripts, it's more suspicious.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a known malicious script for keylogging, along with remote command execution and registry changes, points towards potential malicious activity. Even though some events could be benign, the combination of these factors increases the likelihood that this batch is interesting for investigation. The confidence isn't 100% because some events might be normal, but the presence of keylogging scripts and remote execution is a strong indicator.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with keystroke logging capabilities, combined with suspicious file creation and registry modification events, indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated use of similar script names from different paths and the 'Execute a Remote Command' event further raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
