{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. Each of them uses the same structure: New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, triggering at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high run level. The names of the tasks are different each time, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. That's a lot of scheduled tasks being registered, which is suspicious because normally you wouldn't have so many tasks with different names but the same command.\n\nThen there are other events with PowerShell processes, but they don't have command lines. However, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute scripts temporarily and then clean up. Also, the image loaded events include some DLLs, like mscoree.dll and MpOAV.dll. MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender, so maybe that's a red flag if it's being loaded in an unusual context.\n\nThe repeated creation of scheduled tasks with high privileges (RunLevel Highest) and targeting Administrators group is a big red flag. Scheduled tasks that run as administrators can perform actions that are usually restricted. Also, using calc.exe as the action is a classic example of something benign being used as a payload, which might be a test or a way to avoid detection.\n\nThe fact that multiple tasks are being created with similar commands suggests automation or a script that's generating these tasks. The temporary file creation and deletion could be part of that process, trying to avoid leaving traces. The image loads, especially from the Windows Defender path, might indicate that the script is interacting with security software, perhaps trying to bypass it or being detected by it.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a pattern of creating multiple high-privilege scheduled tasks, using PowerShell scripts that are temporarily stored and then deleted, and loading DLLs that might be related to security software. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some of the events are normal (like chrome.exe creating a pipe), the combination of these PowerShell events is concerning. So, this batch is likely worth investigating further for possible security threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit **multiple suspicious patterns** indicative of potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of key concerns and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Repeated Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**\n- **Multiple PowerShell commands** are creating **scheduled tasks** with:\n  - **`calc.exe`** as the execution payload (a common tactic to bypass detection by using a benign executable).\n  - **`RunLevel Highest`** (admin privileges) and **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** as the principal.\n  - Unique task names (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `tarefa_geral`) suggest automation or obfuscation.\n- **Why this is concerning**: \n  - Scheduled tasks with admin privileges can execute arbitrary code at system startup or user logon, potentially allowing persistence or privilege escalation.\n  - The use of `calc.exe` is a red flag for obfuscation (e.g., hiding malicious payloads within a legitimate process).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Temporary File Creation and Deletion**\n- A **temporary PowerShell script** (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is:\n  - Created in the user's **`AppData\\Local\\Temp`** directory.\n  - Immediately deleted after execution.\n- **Why this is concerning**:\n  - This is a common technique to **avoid leaving forensic evidence** (e.g., malware execution).\n  - The script name (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_...`) suggests it may be related to **script policy testing** or **bypassing execution restrictions** (e.g., bypassing PowerShell's execution policies).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Unusual DLL Loading**\n- PowerShell processes load **unusual DLLs**, including:\n  - `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll` (Windows Defender component).\n- **Why this is concerning**:\n  - Loading a **Windows Defender DLL** in an unexpected context could indicate **tampering with security software** or **malware attempting to interact with it** (e.g., bypassing real-time protection).\n\n---\n\n### **4. High Frequency of PowerShell Activity**\n- **Numerous PowerShell-related events** are logged, including:\n  - `Process Create`, `Image Load`, `File Create\/Delete`, and `Registry value set`.\n  - Multiple instances of **`ProcessAccess`** and **`RegistryEvent`** suggest **active manipulation of system state**.\n- **Why this is concerning**:\n  - PowerShell is a common tool for **malware execution** (e.g., downloading and executing payloads, modifying registry keys).\n  - The volume of events may indicate **script-based attacks** or **automated exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Presence of Chrome.exe and Pipe Events**\n- **`chrome.exe`** is logged with **`Pipe Created`** and **`Registry value set`** events.\n- **Why this is less concerning**:\n  - Chrome is a legitimate application, and pipe creation is normal for inter-process communication.\n  - However, **correlation with PowerShell activity** (e.g., if Chrome is being used as a proxy for malicious actions) would warrant further investigation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: This Batch Requires Investigation**\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:\n  - Scheduled tasks with admin privileges and `calc.exe`.\n  - Temporary script creation\/deletion.\n  - Unusual DLL loading (e.g., Windows Defender components).\n  - High-frequency PowerShell activity.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - Analyze the **deleted temporary script** (if possible) for malicious content.\n  - Check for **unauthorized changes to scheduled tasks** or registry keys.\n  - Monitor **Windows Defender logs** for signs of tampering or bypass attempts.\n  - Investigate **PowerShell command history** and **script execution policies**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict**\n**Yes, this batch is highly suspicious and warrants immediate investigation** due to the combination of elevated privilege exploitation, temporary file obfuscation, and anomalous DLL loading. These patterns are consistent with **malware persistence techniques** or **post-exploitation activity**."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries and wants me to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The answer needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I need to look through all the events. Let me scan through them. The first event is a process with a command line that uses PowerShell to create a scheduled task. The command is creating a task that runs calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group and highest privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there are several entries for chrome.exe and svchost.exe with registry value set events. Those might be normal, but if there's a pattern, maybe not. Then, there's a file created by svchost.exe at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path is in the System32 directory, which is a common place for legitimate tasks, but creating a task there might be part of a malicious activity.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory, which could be normal, but combined with other events might be suspicious. There's also a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that might be legitimate. However, the presence of multiple scheduled task creations and registry changes could indicate something malicious.\n\nThe event with WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll is part of Windows Management Instrumentation, which is normal, but if there are multiple such events, maybe not. Also, the repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks might indicate remote code execution attempts.\n\nPutting it all together, the first event is clearly creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, which is a red flag. The other events might be noise, but combined with the first one, it's suspicious. So the classification would be INTERESTING because of the scheduled task creation with high privileges and the associated file creation in system directories. The confidence is around 0.85 because there's a clear malicious action in one event, but other events might be benign.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) that execute calc.exe at logon, which is a common technique for persistence and privilege escalation. Additionally, there are multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events and file creation in system directories, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there are six entries with chrome.exe and a registry value set. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but multiple times? Maybe, but not sure yet. Then there's a DNS query from chrome.exe. That could be normal, like when you browse the web. \n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But the path has .new, which sometimes indicates a temporary file. Not sure if that's suspicious.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_auxiliar.txt. The name is in Spanish, which might be benign, but sometimes attackers use non-English names to avoid detection. However, creating a text file isn't necessarily malicious. \n\nLooking at the combination: multiple registry changes by chrome, a DNS query, and two file creations. The first six events are all chrome.exe and registry changes. If this is part of normal operation, maybe not interesting. But if the registry changes are related to persistence or configuration changes, that could be a red flag. However, without more details on the registry keys or values, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe DNS query is normal for chrome. The winlogbeat file creation is likely part of its setup. The powershell-created file might be benign, but if there's a pattern of multiple file creations or other suspicious activity, it could be a sign. However, on its own, these events don't clearly indicate malicious behavior. \n\nConfidence is medium. There's no clear evidence of an attack, but the repetition of registry changes and the presence of a file created by PowerShell might warrant further investigation. But since the justification needs to be concise, I'd say the batch is not interesting unless there's more context. Maybe the repetition of registry changes by chrome is normal, so overall, it's not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of routine Chrome registry modifications, a standard DNS query, and benign file creation activities by legitimate processes (winlogbeat and PowerShell). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
