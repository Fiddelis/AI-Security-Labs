So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the JSON entries, most of them are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines are pretty similar, involving the creation of scheduled tasks with 'calc.exe' as the action. The triggers are set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be a way to maintain persistence on a system.\n\nWait, calc.exe is just a calculator. Why would someone create a scheduled task to run that? Usually, attackers use this technique to execute malicious payloads under the guise of a benign process. The repeated creation of scheduled tasks with different names like 'unidade_ativo', 'entrada_ativo', etc., might indicate an attempt to set up multiple backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAlso, there are entries about image loads, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it might be part of a larger attack. The file creation and deletion in the Temp directory could be part of script execution that's trying to clean up after itself, which is a common evasion technique.\n\nHowever, there are also some entries that are not related to PowerShell, like chrome.exe and registry events. But those might be normal user activity. The key here is the pattern of scheduled task creation with admin rights. The fact that multiple tasks are being registered with different names but the same structure suggests a systematic effort to establish persistence.\n\nI should also check if there are any entries that indicate remote command execution, but looking at the logs, the 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks don't have process info, which might be incomplete logs or maybe a red herring. However, the PowerShell activities are more concrete.\n\nIn summary, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges using PowerShell, combined with the use of temporary files and .NET components, points towards a potential security threat. This would be worth investigating further to confirm if it's a legitimate activity or part of a cyber attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events indicates **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Patterns**\n1. **Repetitive Scheduled Task Creation**:\n   - Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands to create scheduled tasks with the same structure:\n     ```powershell\n     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"\n     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon\n     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId \"BUILTIN\\Administrators\" -RunLevel Highest\n     Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"unidade_ativo\" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Principal $User\n     ```\n   - **Why this is concerning**:\n     - **`calc.exe`** is a benign utility, but attackers often use it as a placeholder for malicious payloads (e.g., to avoid detection).\n     - **`BUILTIN\\Administrators`** with **`RunLevel Highest`** grants elevated privileges, enabling persistence and potential system compromise.\n     - **Multiple task names** (e.g., `unidade_ativo`, `estrutura_auxiliar`, `unidade_comum`) suggest an attempt to create redundant persistence mechanisms.\n\n2. **File Creation\/Deletion in Temporary Directories**:\n   - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) is created in `%TEMP%` and immediately deleted. This is a common **evasion tactic** to avoid leaving evidence on disk.\n\n3. **.NET Runtime Components**:\n   - Logs show loading of `.NET`-related DLLs (e.g., `clrjit.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). While normal for PowerShell, this could indicate **script execution** or interaction with **Windows Defender** (e.g., `MpClient.dll` is part of Microsoft Defender Antivirus). However, the presence of malicious activity (scheduled tasks) raises concerns about potential **tampering** or **bypassing defenses**.\n\n4. **Remote Command Execution Logs**:\n   - Four entries with the task **`Execute a Remote Command`** (no process details). This could indicate **unauthorized remote access** or incomplete logging, requiring deeper inspection.\n\n---\n\n### **Legitimate vs. Malicious Activity**\n- **Legitimate**: \n  - Scheduled tasks are a standard administrative tool.\n  - PowerShell and .NET are widely used for automation.\n- **Malicious**:\n  - **Unusual repetition** of task creation with identical structures.\n  - **Elevated privileges** (`RunLevel Highest`) for benign tasks.\n  - **File cleanup** in `%TEMP%` suggests evasion.\n  - **Lack of clear purpose** for tasks (e.g., why run `calc.exe` at logon?).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Check the **actual commands** executed by the tasks (e.g., inspect `calc.exe` for embedded payloads).\n   - Verify if the tasks are **legitimate** or part of a **malicious campaign**.\n\n2. **Analyze the PowerShell Script**:\n   - Recover the deleted script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) from memory or disk if possible.\n   - Check for **obfuscation** or **payload injection**.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement**:\n   - Investigate the **`Execute a Remote Command`** logs for signs of **unauthorized access** or **command-and-control (C2) activity**.\n\n4. **Monitor User Activity**:\n   - Confirm if the user `fiddelis` is authorized to perform these actions.\n   - Check for **unusual login times** or **unauthorized network traffic**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe events suggest **malicious persistence attempts** through scheduled tasks and PowerShell. While not definitive proof of compromise, the combination of elevated privileges, file evasion, and repetitive task creation is highly suspicious. **Immediate investigation** is recommended."}

The first event is svchost.exe setting a registry value. That's normal, but maybe not always. Then, svchost.exe creates a file in the Windows Tasks directory. Wait, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. Hmm, System32\\Tasks is where scheduled tasks are stored. Creating a file there could be a sign of a malicious task being added.\n\nNext, there are two events where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's a red flag. If there's no process associated with executing a remote command, it might indicate something like a remote code execution or a command being run without a clear process, which could be a security issue.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's startup profiles. Maybe legitimate, but could be used to persist commands. However, not immediately suspicious unless there's something else.\n\nChrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files. amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, and MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender. So that's normal. But then there are multiple registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry much, so that might be unusual.\n\nThe DNS query from chrome.exe is normal. Then, winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its setup. But the path is in the Downloads directory, which might be less secure. However, if the user is configuring it, that's acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning parts are the svchost.exe creating a task in System32\\Tasks, the remote command executions without a process, and chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. These could indicate an attack, like a malicious task being scheduled, remote execution, or unauthorized registry changes. The confidence is moderate because while some events are suspicious, others are normal. But the combination of these events might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: svchost.exe creating a task in System32\\\\Tasks (potential persistence), unattributed 'Execute a Remote Command' events, and chrome.exe modifying registry values repeatedly (unusual behavior). These could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
