{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180237.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe and a registry value being set. That's a common action, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. However, just setting a registry value isn't necessarily bad. Maybe part of a legitimate script.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process running tasklist. That's a normal command to list running processes. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThird event is again PowerShell, but this time it's a process access. Not sure what that means exactly. Maybe another legitimate action.\n\nThe fourth event is tasklist.exe loading a DLL from C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\wmiutils.dll. Wait, that path seems a bit off. The System32 directory is standard, but wbem is a subdirectory. However, wmiutils.dll is a legitimate file related to Windows Management Instrumentation. So maybe that's okay. But sometimes attackers might use similar paths for malicious DLLs. Hmm, need to check if this is a known legitimate file.\n\nFifth event: PowerShell creating a file in the user's Downloads folder called entrada_logico.txt. Creating files in Downloads is common, but depending on the context. If it's just a text file, maybe not suspicious. But sometimes malware creates files there. However, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nLast event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The path seems to be part of an installation or configuration update. That's probably legitimate.\n\nLooking at all together: There's PowerShell activity, which can be both benign and malicious. The registry change and file creation in Downloads might be normal. The DLL loaded is legitimate. The winlogbeat activity is normal. However, multiple PowerShell events might indicate something, but without more context like unusual commands or network activity, it's hard to tell. The justification here is that there's no clear malicious activity. The events don't show obvious signs like unauthorized access, suspicious network calls, or known malicious files. So the classification is likely \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence because while there are some PowerShell events, they don't clearly indicate a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard system activity with no clear indicators of compromise. PowerShell and cmd.exe usage aligns with typical administrative tasks, file creations are in expected locations, and loaded DLLs are legitimate system components. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected across the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
