So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Now, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Typically, system DLLs are loaded by legitimate processes, but if a non-system process is loading them, that might be a red flag. However, I should check if there's any other suspicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's a rundll32.exe process executing a command with shell32.dll and a GUID. That seems normal for some operations, but the GUID part might be worth checking. Then there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for log shipping, so the file creation there might be okay if it's part of its normal operation. \n\nThe EXCEL.EXE process is loading several DLLs, including mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, and Defender's MpOAV.dll. That seems normal because Excel uses .NET components and Defender's DLLs for scanning. However, the repeated loading of combase.dll and urlmon.dll by SDXHelper.exe might be unusual. \n\nWait, the same SDXHelper.exe is loading those DLLs multiple times. Also, there are several \"User Account Management\" events with process null, which might indicate some account activity, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is also present, which is a legitimate Windows process for WMI, but the image load of wmiutils.dll is normal. \n\nNow, considering the confidence: the presence of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs multiple times is suspicious. However, without more context like unexpected network activity, unusual registry changes, or other signs of malware, it's a bit ambiguous. The other events don't show obvious malicious behavior. \n\nBut the repeated ImageLoad events for SDXHelper.exe with system DLLs might indicate something like a dropper or a malicious process trying to load components. However, since the user hasn't provided other indicators like high entropy files, network connections, or unauthorized access, it's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the classification here is \"INTERESTING\" because the SDXHelper.exe activity is unusual and could be part of a larger attack. But the confidence isn't extremely high because there's not enough evidence yet. Maybe around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe (non-standard process) loading system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll) repeatedly, which could indicate malicious behavior such as DLL hijacking or process injection. However, no direct evidence of exploitation or network activity is present in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event.\n\nFirst, there are two entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The file path is in the Recent folder, and the file is named real_values.csv.LNK. Wait, .LNK is a shortcut file. So Excel is creating shortcut files in the Recent directory. That might be normal, but maybe not. Then there are three entries where EXCEL.EXE is performing DNS queries. \n\nHmm, why would Excel be doing DNS queries? Typically, DNS queries are done by the system when accessing websites or network resources. But if Excel is doing this, maybe it's part of some malicious activity, like communicating with a C2 server. However, creating shortcut files in the Recent folder could be part of normal operations, but maybe it's an indicator of something else. \n\nWait, the Recent folder in Office is where recent files are stored. But creating a .LNK file there might be normal if the user is opening files. However, if the file is named something like real_values.csv.LNK, maybe it's a legitimate file. But then again, if there are multiple DNS queries from Excel, that might be suspicious. \n\nBut I need to consider the combination of events. Are there any patterns here? The same process (Excel) creating files and making DNS queries. But without more context, like the destination of the DNS queries or the content of the files, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that Excel is creating shortcut files and making DNS queries could be a red flag. \n\nBut maybe it's just a user working normally. For example, if they're opening a CSV file and Excel is creating a shortcut, and then maybe accessing a website for some reason. However, three DNS queries might be more than usual. \n\nI think the key points here are the combination of file creation in the Recent folder (which could be normal) and the DNS queries. If the DNS queries are to suspicious domains, that would be more concerning. But since the logs don't include the domains, maybe it's not enough to confirm. However, the presence of multiple DNS queries from Excel might still be worth investigating. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of file creation and DNS queries by Excel could indicate a potential security incident, such as malware using Excel to communicate or create shortcuts for persistence. But without more data, it's a bit uncertain. The confidence might be around 0.6 because there's some suspicious activity but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE combined with creation of a .LNK shortcut file in the Office Recent directory may indicate suspicious behavior, such as potential malware persistence or network communication attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
