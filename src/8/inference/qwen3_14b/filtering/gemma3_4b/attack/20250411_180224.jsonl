The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' activities. One of the entries has a command line that uses 'schtasks' to create a scheduled task with '\/ru system' which means it's running as the system user. That's a red flag because typically, scheduled tasks running as system might be used for persistence by attackers. The command line also includes running a PowerShell script with '-ep bypass', which is often used to bypass execution policies, a common tactic in malware.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation events. There's a file created at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times', which is a typical location for scheduled tasks. However, the name 'win32times' seems a bit generic and might be a placeholder, which could indicate a malicious task. Also, there's a mention of 'NonExistingScript.ps1' in the command line. Wait, the script is named 'NonExistingScript.ps1' but the path is 'c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another instance is 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. The use of 'NonExisting' in the filename is odd. Maybe the attacker is trying to mask the actual script name, or perhaps it's a typo, but more likely, it's part of obfuscation. However, the fact that the script isn't found (non-existing) might mean that the attacker is trying to execute a script that doesn't exist, which could be a mistake or part of a larger plan to evade detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to the system's configuration. The processes like 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' are also involved in registry changes, but since those are common system processes, it's hard to tell without more context. However, the combination with the scheduled tasks and PowerShell activities raises suspicion.\n\nThere are also file creation events for '.winlogbeat.yml.new' and 'estrutura_geral.txt' which might be benign, but the presence of multiple file creations and the suspicious scheduled task setup seems more concerning. The 'whoami.exe' command is a standard tool for checking user context, so that's probably normal, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger sequence.\n\nPutting it all together, the key indicators are the creation of a scheduled task with system privileges, the use of PowerShell with bypassed execution policies, and the mention of non-existing scripts. These are classic signs of an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious code. Even though some parts might be benign, the combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries contain **multiple suspicious indicators** that suggest potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators**\n1. **Scheduled Task with System Privileges**:\n   - A `schtasks` command is used to create a scheduled task running as **`SYSTEM`** (high-privilege):\n     ```\n     schtasks \/create \/tn \"win32times\" \/tr \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -f c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\" \/sc once \/st 12:00 \/ru system\n     ```\n   - **Why this is suspicious**: \n     - Running as `SYSTEM` is often exploited by attackers for persistence.\n     - The task name (`win32times`) is generic and may be obfuscated.\n\n2. **PowerShell Execution with `-ep bypass`**:\n   - Multiple `powershell.exe` processes use the `-ep bypass` flag to **bypass execution policies**, a common tactic in malware to execute scripts without user interaction.\n   - The referenced script (`NonExistingScript.ps1`) is named **`NonExisting`**, which may indicate an attempt to **obfuscate or mask** the script's purpose (e.g., a typo, placeholder, or evasion technique).\n\n3. **Non-Existent Script Path**:\n   - The script `NonExistingScript.ps1` is referenced but **not found** in the logs. This could indicate:\n     - A **malicious script not yet deployed** (e.g., staged for later execution).\n     - A **mistake or misconfiguration** (though unlikely in a targeted attack).\n\n4. **Unusual File Creations**:\n   - Files like `estrutura_geral.txt` and `.winlogbeat.yml.new` are created in user directories. While not inherently malicious, their presence alongside other suspicious activity may indicate **data exfiltration** or **configuration tampering** (e.g., modifying Winlogbeat, a log shipper).\n\n5. **Abnormal Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `Registry Value Set` events (e.g., by `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`) could indicate **tampering with system settings** or **injection of malicious configurations**.\n\n---\n\n### **Contextual Red Flags**\n- **PowerShell and `cmd.exe` Usage**: Frequent use of these tools with obfuscated commands is a common **post-exploitation technique**.\n- **Lack of Clear Benign Purpose**: The combination of scheduled tasks, non-existent scripts, and registry changes lacks a clear benign explanation (e.g., legitimate software installation or system updates).\n- **Repetition of Events**: Multiple entries for the same suspicious actions (e.g., `NonExistingScript.ps1`, `.winlogbeat.yml.new`) suggest **patterned behavior** consistent with automated attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Task**:\n   - Check the actual task details in the system (e.g., via `schtasks \/query`).\n   - Verify if the script `NonExistingScript.ps1` exists on disk and its contents.\n\n2. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - If the script is found, inspect it for malicious payloads (e.g., code injection, data exfiltration).\n\n3. **Monitor Winlogbeat and Registry Changes**:\n   - Check if `.winlogbeat.yml.new` is part of a legitimate configuration update or a **tampered log shipper**.\n   - Audit registry changes to identify unauthorized modifications.\n\n4. **Check User Activity**:\n   - Correlate these logs with user logs (e.g., login events, `whoami.exe` output) to determine if **unauthorized access** occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs exhibit **high-risk indicators** consistent with **malware persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security incident**."}
