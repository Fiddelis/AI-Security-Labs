{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances of PowerShell.exe executing commands. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe. The triggers are set to AtLogon, and the principal is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be a way to escalate privileges or persist access.\n\nThe names of the scheduled tasks are varied, like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. This might be part of a pattern where an attacker is setting up multiple scheduled tasks under different names to avoid detection. Also, using PowerShell to create these tasks is common in attacks, especially if they're obfuscating the command.\n\nThen, there are other events related to PowerShell, like registry value sets and process accesses. However, the key part here is the repeated creation of scheduled tasks with admin rights. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate executable, the context here is about creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, which is a red flag.\n\nThe other events involving chrome.exe and image loads (like mscoree.dll, clr.dll) might be normal if the user is running .NET applications, but combined with the scheduled task creations, it could indicate a more complex attack. However, the main suspicious activity here is the multiple scheduled task creations with admin rights via PowerShell.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple attempts to create scheduled tasks with high privileges, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. Even though some events might be benign, the combination here is concerning. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with administrative privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, RunLevel Highest) to execute calc.exe at logon. This pattern is commonly associated with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms in malicious activity. The repetition of similar commands across different task names suggests potential obfuscation or automated deployment.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender... MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Wait, those are legitimate Windows Defender files. So maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory, __PSScriptPolicyTest...gde.ps1, and then immediately deleted. That's a red flag. Why create and delete a script so quickly? It might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Not sure about that yet. Then, looking at the command line for powershell.exe, there's a scheduled task being created with New-ScheduledTaskAction to run calc.exe. The trigger is at logon, and it's set to run as Administrators with highest privileges. That seems suspicious. Creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe (which is a benign app) might be a test, but the use of high privileges and the Administrators group could be a sign of something malicious. Also, the task is named \"estrutura_auxiliar$object\" and \"unidade_comum$object\" â€“ those names don't look standard. Maybe they're trying to disguise the task.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. But if it's just setting registry values, maybe that's normal. However, the repetition might indicate something. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the majority of the logs are about powershell.exe and the scheduled tasks.\n\nThen there are a bunch of entries with process \"None\" and the task \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's concerning. If the process is None, maybe it's a log source issue, but having multiple entries of remote command execution attempts could indicate a potential attack. However, the logs don't show successful execution, just the attempt. But the presence of so many of these might be indicative of a brute force attack or a script trying to execute commands remotely.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious activities are the creation and deletion of a temp script, the scheduled tasks with high privileges, and the multiple remote command attempts. The Windows Defender files are legitimate, so those are probably not the issue. The chrome.exe registry changes might be benign, but the other events are more concerning. The combination of these events suggests that there might be an attempt to execute malicious scripts, set up persistent access via scheduled tasks, and possibly remote execution. Even though some parts are normal, the overall pattern points towards a potential security incident. Therefore, the batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file, scheduled task creation with high-privilege execution (Administrators group), and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events. These patterns suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION_DETAILS\": \"1. Temp script creation\/deletion (likely obfuscation). 2. Scheduled task with elevated privileges (calc.exe execution as Administrator). 3. 25+ 'Execute a Remote Command' events (possible brute-force or exploitation attempts). Legitimate Windows Defender file accesses are normal but do not indicate malicious behavior.\"\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate process, but sometimes malware uses legitimate processes. However, just loading a system DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about svchost.exe setting registry values. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values could be normal, but if it's done repeatedly or in a certain context, it might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother entry is the creation of a file in the Tasks directory named \"unidade_comum\". That path seems a bit odd. The name \"unidade_comum\" translates to \"common unit\" in Portuguese, which might be a red herring. But creating a file in the Tasks directory could be part of setting up a scheduled task, which is sometimes used by malware.\n\nThen there's an entry with \"Execute a Remote Command\" from a process that's None. That's concerning because it suggests a command was executed without a clear process, which could be a sign of a remote exploit or something like PowerShell being used without proper attribution.\n\nThe PowerShell.exe entries include creating files in the user's AppData directory, which is common for legitimate scripts, but also could be used for malicious purposes. However, creating a startup profile file might be part of normal PowerShell configuration.\n\nThere's a mention of Chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate DLLs related to Windows Defender and Anti-Malware, so that's probably normal. But Chrome loading them might be a bit unusual, though not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entries are about creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal during setup or updates. However, if the file is in a downloads directory, it might be part of a manual configuration, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThe repeated registry changes by Chrome.exe could be part of normal operations, but if they're modifying specific keys that control system behavior, that might be suspicious. However, without knowing the exact keys, it's hard to say.\n\nThe Dns query entry from Chrome.exe is normal for browsing, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nPutting it all together: There are a few potentially suspicious points, like the remote command execution with no process, the file created in the Tasks directory, and multiple registry changes. However, many of these events could be normal system activity. The confidence here is a bit low because there's not enough evidence to confirm malicious intent. It's possible that this is just a normal system with some legitimate processes. But the presence of some unusual events like the remote command and the file in the Tasks directory might warrant further investigation. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events including remote command execution (no process associated), creation of a file in the Windows Tasks directory (potential scheduled task manipulation), and repeated registry modifications by Chrome.exe. While some events may be benign, the combination raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
