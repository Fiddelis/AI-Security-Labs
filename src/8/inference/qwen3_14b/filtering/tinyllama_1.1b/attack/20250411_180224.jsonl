The first event stands out because it's a cmd.exe process creating a scheduled task with the command line that includes running a PowerShell script. The script path is \"c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\", which doesn't exist. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task to run a non-existent script might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a process access event for PowerShell.exe, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's suspicious. The next events involve cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, which are part of the Windows Task Scheduler. The command line for schtasks includes querying the task named \"win32times\", which might be normal, but combined with the earlier creation, it could indicate an attempt to set up a persistent task.\n\nThe other events involve registry value sets and image loads, but they don't seem immediately malicious. There are also events related to chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which might be normal user activity or monitoring tools. However, the key point here is the initial scheduled task creation with a non-existent script. That behavior is often seen in malware trying to execute scripts that are either not present or are being downloaded later.\n\nEven though some events are benign, the combination of creating a scheduled task with a non-existent script and the subsequent queries might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. The confidence isn't 100% because there's not enough data to confirm malicious intent definitively, but the presence of these events warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious scheduled task creation via cmd.exe with a non-existent PowerShell script path ('c:\\\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1'), which may indicate an attempt to execute hidden or remote scripts. This is combined with schtasks.exe activity and registry modifications, suggesting potential persistence mechanism attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
