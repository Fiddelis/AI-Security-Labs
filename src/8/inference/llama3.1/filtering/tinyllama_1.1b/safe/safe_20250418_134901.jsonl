The log contains information about various system events, including process creations, registry value changes, and file creates.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different fields in each event:\n\n1. `process`: Information about the process that triggered the event, including its name.\n2. `winlog`: Information about the Windows event, including its type (e.g., \"Process Create\", \"Registry Value Set\") and rule ID (e.g., \"FileCreate\").\n3. `file`: Information about a file related to the event, including its path.\n\nSome notable events in the log:\n\n* A Winlogbeat process is creating a new .winlogbeat.yml file in the downloads directory.\n* Multiple instances of Chrome and SDXHelper processes are loading DLLs (e.g., urlmon.dll) into memory.\n* Svchost.exe is setting registry values related to Windows services.\n* Taskhostw.exe is loading task scheduling DLLs (taskschd.dll).\n* OneDriveLauncher.exe is loading the URLMON DLL.\n\nThese events may indicate normal system activity, but they could also be signs of malicious activity if you're not expecting these processes and files to run on your system."}
