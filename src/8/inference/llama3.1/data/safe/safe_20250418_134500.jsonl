{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This is a log file from the WinLogBeat tool, which collects and forwards Windows event logs to a server for analysis. Here's a breakdown of the events captured in this log:\n\n**Initial Events**\n\n1. The first few lines indicate that the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process is running on the system. This is likely an update process for Microsoft Edge.\n2. The `winlogbeat.exe` process, which is responsible for collecting and forwarding event logs, is also detected.\n\n**Event Log Captures**\n\nThe log captures several events from various processes:\n\n1. **Process Access**: Events indicate that the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` processes have accessed certain files or registry keys.\n2. **Image Loaded**: Events show that various DLLs (e.g., `msedgeupdate.dll`) are being loaded by the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process.\n3. **File Created**: Events indicate that new log files (`*.ndjson`) are being created in the `logs` directory of the `winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64` installation folder.\n\n**Network Connection**\n\nOne event suggests a network connection was established by the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process, but no specific details about the connection (e.g., destination IP, protocol) are provided.\n\n**Process Termination**\n\nThe log captures multiple events indicating that the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process has terminated. This could be due to various reasons such as successful completion of the update or an error during execution.\n\nOverall, this log provides insight into the activities performed by the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` processes on the system, including file access, network connections, and process termination events.\n\nIf you'd like me to highlight specific security concerns or anomalies within these logs, please let me know."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134500.jsonl","analysis":"This appears to be a log file from Winlogbeat, an Elasticsearch Beat that collects Windows event logs and sends them to an Elasticsearch server for analysis.\n\nThe log contains various events related to process creation, file access, registry modifications, DNS queries, and more. Here are some of the notable events:\n\n1. **Process creations:**\n\t* notepad.exe is launched.\n\t* svchost.exe creates a new file in the Delivery Optimization cache.\n\t* MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creates a new file in its installation directory.\n2. **File access:**\n\t* A new file is created in the Windows Service Profiles directory.\n\t* Files are accessed or deleted in various directories, including Program Files (x86) and AppData\\Local.\n3. **Registry modifications:**\n\t* The Explorer.EXE process sets a registry value.\n4. **DNS queries:**\n\t* CompatTelRunner.exe performs a DNS query.\n5. **File deletions:**\n\t* MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe deletes a file in the Temp directory.\n\nTo analyze these events further, you would typically need to review them within an Elasticsearch server or a tool like Kibana that integrates with Elasticsearch. This can help identify potential security issues, system performance problems, or other insights about what's happening on the system.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about this log file or would you like me to help with analyzing it further?"}
