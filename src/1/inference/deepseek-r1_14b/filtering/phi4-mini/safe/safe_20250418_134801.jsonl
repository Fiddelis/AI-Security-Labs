Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events involving \"MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\". The tasks include file creation and deletion. For example, one event shows the creation of an Edge update file, and another shows a delete operation. This seems normal because Edge updates often download and then install or delete old files automatically.\n\nNext, I notice multiple entries for \"MpCmdRun.exe\", which is related to Windows Defender. It's loading image files and creating temporary locks. These activities are typical for antivirus software, so they don't raise any red flags.\n\nThere's also an event from \"conhost.exe\" modifying a registry value. Conhost is part of the Command Prompt, and it's common for processes to interact with the registry. No unusual behavior here.\n\nThen there are several events from \"git.exe\". Each one creates files in a directory related to Node.js modules like semver. Since this is happening under a user's Downloads folder and pertains to development tools, it looks like someone is working on a project using Git. This activity is expected if the user is developing software.\n\nPutting all these together, most of the events are normal system operations—updates installing, antivirus running, and a user working with code. There’s nothing malicious or out of the ordinary in this batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as file updates, antivirus operations, and development tool usage.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's look at what each event says.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. They all have \"process\" with name \"git.exe\", which means the Git command-line tool was running. The \"winlog\" part shows that it's a file creation event, triggered by a rule called FileCreate. So, this is Windows logging when files are created.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they're all inside different directories under node_modules. For example, there's serialize-javascript, set-blocking, set-function-length, and shebang-command. These look like Node.js module names. The paths also include standard files like LICENSE, package.json, index.js, README.md, etc., which are typical for npm packages.\n\nSince all these events involve the same process (git.exe) creating various files in a node_modules directory, it seems like someone is cloning or installing Node.js modules using Git. This could be part of setting up a development environment or deploying an application.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. There's nothing indicating unauthorized access, unusual file permissions, or creation of hidden files. It's all standard file operations related to package management in Node.js, which is expected during setup or updates.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, they're not raising any red flags. The classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's normal behavior when someone is working with Node.js packages.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, indicating typical npm package installations or updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they're about Microsoft Edge updates creating files and changing timestamps. That seems normal because browsers often update in the background. Then there are entries from CompatTelRunner.exe loading DLLs, which is standard system behavior.\n\nNext, there are several events related to user account management without any process details. This could be part of regular login processes or system services checking permissions. Services.exe logon events are also typical for Windows services starting up.\n\nI notice a command line entry running powershell.exe with an execution policy set to Restricted. That's interesting because while PowerShell is common, using it with a restricted policy might indicate script execution, but it's not necessarily malicious unless the script does something suspicious. However, in this case, the command seems to be checking for specific .inf files, which could be related to driver installations or system configurations.\n\nThere are multiple entries of svchost.exe making registry changes and creating files. Svchost is a common Windows process used by services, so these actions alone aren't concerning unless they're part of known malicious activities. The paths mentioned, like DeliveryOptimization Cache, seem legitimate for Windows updates or system optimization features.\n\nOther events include the Calculator loading URLMON.DLL, which is normal, and winlogbeat creating files in its data directory, which suggests it's just capturing logs as intended.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these events are standard system operations. The only potentially interesting part is the PowerShell command checking .inf files, but without more context on what was executed or any other unusual behavior, it doesn't raise red flags. Therefore, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly normal system activities and do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL entries where each line represents an event. Each event has three main components: the process name, the Windows log task, and file details.\n\nThe process name in all these events is \"git.exe\". That makes me think that this is related to Git, which is commonly used for version control in software development. The task in each event is \"File created\", so it's about files being created on the system.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\". This seems like a user directory, probably where someone is working on a project. The specific files being created are within the \"node_modules\" folder of a directory named \"semver\". Node modules are part of JavaScript\/Node.js projects, so this might be related to installing or updating a package.\n\nThe file names vary but include .js files like functions\/prerelease.js and rsort.js, as well as internal files and configuration files. These look like standard parts of the semver package, which is used for versioning in software projects. Git often interacts with node_modules when managing dependencies in a project.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, it looks like someone is using Git to create or update files within a Node.js project's dependencies. This is pretty normal behavior for developers working on software projects. There's nothing here that stands out as malicious or unusual. It doesn't indicate any signs of compromise, like unexpected processes or writes to restricted areas.\n\nI should also think about why someone would perform such an investigation. If these events were part of a breach, I might expect to see different patterns—like files being created in system directories, or processes running with elevated privileges. Instead, this is all happening within user space and related to development tools.\n\nTherefore, while it's good practice to monitor for any file creation activities, especially in this context, these events don't raise any red flags. They fit the profile of a developer working on their project using Git and Node.js.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity by git.exe during a development process, specifically related to node_modules\/semver files.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. All the events show that git.exe is creating files in various locations under a node_modules directory. Node modules are standard when installing npm packages for Node.js applications, so seeing these file creations isn't unusual during development or deployment.\n\nThe paths listed, like sshpk and string-width, are typical package names found on npm. The fact that they're being created by git.exe suggests this might be part of a Git repository's setup or clone process, which is a normal activity when working with version control systems.\n\nI don't notice any signs of malicious behavior here, such as unusual file paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or execution of unknown scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, looking at the data, each line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements across all these events are that they're all created by \"git.exe\" and they're file creation events.\n\nThe files being created are located in a path that includes \"node_modules\", which immediately makes me think of a Node.js project structure. Each entry shows different files like package.json, index.js, README.md, etc., which are typical for modules in a Node.js environment. Also, the names of the modules like \"shebang-command\" and \"signal-exit\" sound familiar as common npm packages.\n\nI wonder if these events could indicate malicious activity. Git is commonly used for version control, so creating files during a clone or install process seems normal. The fact that all these files are under node_modules suggests that this might be part of installing dependencies, which is a standard step in setting up a project.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the volume of events stands out. There are 14 entries here, each with similar structures. While it's possible for a malicious actor to create many files quickly, in this case, they all look like legitimate module files. The paths don't show any red flags like temporary directories or system files that might be suspicious.\n\nI'm also thinking about the user context. If this is happening on a user's machine, especially under their Downloads folder, it could just be them working on a project. There's no indication of elevated privileges or access to sensitive areas beyond what a standard user would have.\n\nMoreover, looking at the file types and names, they all seem to be part of software development—licenses, configuration files, package managers, etc. No executable files outside of node_modules are present, which could have been a red flag.\n\nSo putting it all together: same process creating multiple files in a structure that's standard for Node.js modules. No unusual file names or locations. It looks like normal activity during the setup or update of a software project.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation actions by git.exe under node_modules, indicating legitimate Node.js package installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. Each event is a JSON object with some details about file creation actions on Windows. The process name in each case is \"git.exe\", which tells me that Git is the tool performing these operations. \n\nThe events all have the same task: \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" and they're creating files in specific paths. I notice that the paths are within a \"node_modules\" directory, which is typical for JavaScript or Node.js projects where third-party libraries are stored.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they include various components like licenses, READMEs, package.json files, and other documentation or source code files (like index.js and .js files). This pattern suggests that Git is cloning or updating a repository, possibly installing dependencies using npm, which often creates multiple files in the node_modules folder.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. The process is standard for someone working on a Node.js project. There's no indication of unusual file names, access times, or other red flags that might point to malicious behavior.

Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have similar structures. Each event has a \"process\" field where the name is \"git.exe\". Then there's a \"winlog\" indicating that a file was created under the task \"FileCreate\", and a \"file\" path which seems to be pointing to various files in a directory structure.\n\nThe paths are all within \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\\" followed by different package names like signal-exit, slice-ansi, sshpk, and so on. Each event corresponds to the creation of a specific file in these directories.\n\nMy initial thought is that this might be part of a software installation or setup process. Git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially with Node.js packages. The presence of \"node_modules\" suggests that this could be related to a Node.js project where dependencies are being installed. Each event represents the creation of individual files as part of the npm install process.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's anything suspicious here. Since all events are from the same process and relate to standard file operations during package installation, it doesn't seem unusual. There's no indication of any malicious activity like access to restricted areas, multiple failed login attempts, or unexpected processes.\n\nBut wait, sometimes attackers might mimic normal behavior. Could these events be part of a larger pattern that's actually malicious? For example, maybe the creation of many files quickly could indicate something, but in this case, each event is just one file being created without any anomalies like timing issues or access patterns.\n\nThe justification for classification would hinge on whether this activity falls outside normal operations. Since it looks like legitimate npm package installations, especially given the structure and the use of git.exe, I don't see a reason to flag this as interesting from a security standpoint.\n\nHowever, there's also the consideration that if these events are part of a larger set that hasn't been provided, they might indicate something else.

Let me start by looking at each event individually.\n\nAll the logs have \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes sense because Git is a version control tool often used in development environments. The task is consistently a file creation event, which aligns with how Git can clone repositories and create files during that process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different JavaScript files within the \"node_modules\/tcomb\/lib\" directory. This suggests that these are part of a Node.js module named tcomb being set up or updated. The files created include various .js files like Array.js, Date.js, Error.js, etc., which are typical for a library or framework.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these events indicate malicious activity. Since Git is commonly used and file creation during its operation is normal, especially when cloning or pulling repositories, this doesn't raise red flags. The presence of node_modules also points to a standard setup in a Node.js environment, which isn't unusual for development setups.\n\nIs there any pattern here that might be suspicious? Each event creates one file under the same directory, but that's exactly how Git would behave when initializing or updating dependencies. There's no indication of multiple writes from different processes or locations, which could hint at something wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the timestamps and frequency, if these events happened in quick succession during a Git operation, it wouldn't be concerning. Unless there were other signs like unusual times or multiple failed attempts, but that's not present here.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of log injection or spoofing, but without additional context, I can't assume that. The consistency in process name and task makes me more confident these are legitimate activities.\n\nSo, after reviewing all events together, they seem to be part of a normal development workflow, specifically related to setting up or updating a Node.js project using Git. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious file creation, or other suspicious activities indicated by the logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activity from the Git process during a typical development workflow, such as cloning or updating a repository.

Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the process name: it's git.exe. Git is a version control tool commonly used by developers for code repositories. So seeing git.exe in logs isn't unusual on systems where development work happens.\n\nNext, the event type is File Created under the Windows log task. This means a file was created, which sounds normal unless there's an unusual pattern or it's happening in unexpected locations.\n\nNow, checking the file path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\isTypeName.js. Breaking this down, the user is 'fiddelis', and the path leads to a node_modules folder inside a directory named S206 - Qualidade de Software. Node_modules is typically where npm packages are stored, especially in development projects.\n\nThe file created is isTypeName.js within the tcomb library. Tcomb is a JavaScript library for creating typed data structures, which again suggests this is related to a development environment. So the creation of this file fits the pattern of a developer working on their project.\n\nPutting it all together: git.exe is involved in version control, possibly cloning or updating a repository. The file creation event is within a node_modules directory as part of a JavaScript project. This seems like standard development activity rather than any malicious behavior.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or suspicious activities typically associated with cyber threats. Therefore, the batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events indicate normal file creation activity related to a software development environment using Git and Node.js.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
