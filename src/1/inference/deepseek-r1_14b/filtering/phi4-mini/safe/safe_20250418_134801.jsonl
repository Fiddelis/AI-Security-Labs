Let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event is about Microsoft Edge update files being accessed. It mentions a file path with \"EDGEMITMP_F12CA.tmp\" which sounds like temporary files, probably during an update. That seems normal and not suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are some events related to CompatTelRunner.exe loading AMSI.dll. I know that AMSI is related to antivirus scanning, so that's a standard process for security. No red flags here.\n\nThen, setup.exe creating a pipe event. Setup processes often create pipes for communication, especially during installations or updates. Not suspicious either.\n\nThe services.exe logon events are pretty common as part of system services starting up. Nothing unusual there.\n\nThere are multiple User Account Management tasks without process info. These could be related to user login\/logoff activities, which are normal unless there's an unusual pattern, but in this batch, it seems routine.\n\nLooking at the Task Scheduler and svchost.exe events, these are standard for system processes managing services and scheduled tasks. No issues spotted here.\n\nThe PowerShell command catches my attention because it's querying INI files in the Windows INF directory. The command is using a restricted execution policy, which might be a good sign, but it's still executing commands that could access sensitive areas like INF files, which are system configuration files. If this script is looking for specific patterns, it might indicate reconnaissance or something malicious, especially since it's checking for defaultinstall sections which are typically used in driver installations. This makes me think there's potential for exploitation or persistence.\n\nThere are some file creation events related to Windows Update logs and the Winlogbeat tool, which is used for log management. These don't seem problematic unless they're part of an attack chain I'm not seeing here.\n\nThe Microsoft Edge file deletion event might be part of a normal cleanup process during updates, but it's worth noting in case it's related to hiding files after malicious activity.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading various Defender-related files is standard for antivirus operations. However, the creation of a lock file in the Windows Temp directory could be part of an update or scan process, which doesn't raise alarms unless there's an unusual number of such events.\n\nPutting this all together, while most events are normal system activities, the PowerShell command stands out because it's accessing sensitive files and using regular expressions to look for specific patterns. This behavior could be indicative of malicious activity, like searching for drivers or other components that might allow persistence or privilege escalation. The presence of this script execution is what makes the batch interesting for further investigation.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these events are part of a coordinated attack, but the PowerShell activity alone is concerning enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activity such as a PowerShell command querying system files and potential file deletions, indicating possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The common elements in each are the process name \"git.exe\", a file creation task from Windows logs, and specific file paths.\n\nThe files being created are all within the \"semver\" module directory under node_modules. This suggests that Git is cloning or updating dependencies for a Node.js project, specifically the semver package manager. These events look typical during development when packages are installed or updated.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each one is a JSON object with three main fields: process, winlog, and file. All the entries have the same process name, which is \"git.exe\". The task in the winlog field consistently says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that files are being created.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with a common directory: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\\". This seems to be a specific user's download folder. The subdirectories vary but include things like node_modules and package.json files, which are typical for Node.js projects. There are also .js and .json files, along with some documentation files like README.md and CHANGELOG.md.\n\nI notice that the file paths all point to different modules within a node_modules directory. This makes me think that git.exe is being used to clone or manage a Git repository, which is a common practice for managing Node.js packages. The fact that multiple files are being created in sequence suggests this might be part of a package installation or dependency update process.\n\nSince all these events are related to the same user and project directory, and they involve standard file operations during development or version control activities, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious behavior. These actions are typical for someone working on a software project using Git and Node.js.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether creating multiple files in such a pattern could be part of a script or automated process that might have suspicious intent. But given the context of node_modules and package.json, it's more likely legitimate activity related to building or managing a JavaScript application.\n\nI'm also thinking about the confidence level. The events are consistent with normal development workflows, so I'm fairly confident they're not malicious. Still, without additional context like timestamps or user behavior, there's a small chance of oversight, but it's minimal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show git.exe creating multiple files in a node_modules directory, which is typical for Node.js development activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's look at the details.\n\nEach event shows that git.exe is creating a file. The paths are all under node_modules in a directory related to \"Qualidade de Software\" which translates to \"Software Quality.\" These files include various Node.js modules like set-function-length, shebang-command, and side-channel. They're also including standard files for packages like package.json, index.js, etc.\n\nHmm, so git.exe is creating these files. Git often clones repositories or checks out code, so it's normal for it to create new files in a project directory. The node_modules folder suggests this is part of a Node.js application setup, which would typically involve installing dependencies using npm. \n\nI should consider if this activity is suspicious. Malware might try to create files, but the pattern here looks like standard development activities. All the file names and paths align with typical module structures for a software project. There's no indication of unusual file types or locations outside the expected project directory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these logs likely just show someone setting up or updating a Node.js project using git.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL events here, each representing some file creation activity on a Windows system. The process name is always git.exe, and the task is File created with the rule FileCreate.\n\nLooking at the files being created, they're all under node_modules in various directories. Paths like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules... So, this seems to be related to a Node.js project setup or perhaps someone installing some npm packages.\n\nThe files include .js, .json, and .md files—typical for node modules. For example, there are packages like sshpk, string-width, strip-ansi, etc., which I recognize as common npm packages used in projects. Each event shows a specific file being created by git.exe, which might be part of a Git repository's setup or maybe during a build process.\n\nNow, considering the context: if someone is working on a Node.js project and using Git, it's normal for these files to be present. The repeated creation of node_modules suggests that this could be during an npm install or similar operation, which would create all these files as part of the package setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No executable files outside of what's typical for node modules, no hidden files, and everything seems to align with standard development practices. The process is git.exe, which is a legitimate tool, so it's unlikely to be associated with anything suspicious in this context.\n\nThe justification for classification would be that these are normal file creation events during the setup or installation of Node.js packages. There’s no indication of unusual behavior, such as multiple failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or unexpected file types being created.\n\nSo, I think this batch is NOT INTERESTING because it's just part of a developer's routine when working with Node.js and Git. The confidence level would be high since all indicators point to legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent normal file creation activities during the setup or installation of Node.js packages, which is typical for a developer environment using Git.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134801.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object, and there are 15 of them. The first thing that stands out is that all the events have the same process name: git.exe. That's interesting because it suggests they're all related to Git operations.\n\nThe task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So these are file creation events, and they're being logged by a rule named FileCreate. The file paths vary but seem to be part of a directory structure. Let me parse the paths to understand better.\n\nLooking at the file paths, I see that they all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. This looks like a directory on a Windows system where some files are being created. The directories under this include node_modules, which is typical for Node.js projects, and specific package names like supports-color, tcomb-validation, tcomb, etc.\n\nEach event creates a file in these directories. For example, the first event creates a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\supports-color\\readme.md. That's a README file for a package called supports-color. Then there are other files like CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, package.json, and various .js files in the tcomb library.\n\nI know that when you install Node.js packages using npm (Node Package Manager), it downloads and installs the packages into the node_modules directory. This process often involves creating several files: package.json for each package, READMEs, licenses, and the actual JavaScript files. So these events seem to be part of a standard npm install operation.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is involved might relate to using Git to manage the project, perhaps during a clone or fetch operation, but it's also common in Dev environments where scripts run as part of the build process.\n\nSo, considering all these points:\n\n1. All events involve file creations by git.exe.\n2. The files are part of Node.js packages being installed.\n3. This is a normal part of setting up a project environment with npm.\n4. There's no indication of unusual activity, like files being created in unexpected locations or from unknown sources.\n\nTherefore, these logs likely represent legitimate package installations during development work.
