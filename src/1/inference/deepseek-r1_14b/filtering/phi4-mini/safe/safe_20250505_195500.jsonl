{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My task is to analyze them all together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each event shows that a file was created in a specific path under the user's AppData directory. The files have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by various hashes. These look like they could be JavaScript files related to an Office add-in or some package.\n\nI remember that legitimate software often creates files during installation or updates, especially in areas like the SolutionPackages folder under Office. So, it's possible these are just regular operations by Microsoft Office components. However, I also know that sometimes malicious actors use similar file-naming conventions to blend in with normal traffic. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen there are a few events from \"chrome.exe\" where registry values were set. This could be normal browser activity, perhaps setting some preferences or extensions. Again, unless these changes are known to be malicious, they might not indicate anything suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple file creations by a legitimate-looking process and some registry changes by Chrome. There's nothing immediately jumping out as obviously malicious here. However, seeing so many files created in quick succession could warrant closer inspection to ensure none of them are part of a larger attack vector or exfiltration attempt.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because while individually these events might be normal, the volume and specific file paths could hint at something more. But I'm not entirely sure without further analysis. My confidence is around 0.6 because there's potential for concern but no clear indicators of compromise yet.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in the same path, potentially indicating suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The key fields are:\n\n- \"process\": name is \"SDXHelper.exe\"\n- \"winlog\": task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"\n- \"file\": path to a JavaScript file in the Office Solution Packages directory, with various filenames\n\nLooking at all 15 events, they're all similar. The process creating files is the same each timeâ€”SDXHelper.exe. The files being created are all under the same path structure but have different filenames ending with .js.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Office's Solution Package eXperience (SPX) platform. It's used for adding and managing customizations or solutions in Office. Creating files in the OfflineFiles directory might be part of how these packages are installed or updated.\n\nThe same file path appears repeatedly, which suggests this is a legitimate process by Office software. The multiple .js files being created could be JavaScript resources needed by the package. Since it's happening from an Office-related process, it doesn't seem malicious at first glance.\n\nHowever, I should consider if such repeated file creation events are normal. It depends on what's typical for SDXHelper.exe activity. If this is part of a standard update or installation process, then it's expected and not suspicious.\n\nBut wait, there are 15 similar events in the batch. That might be a lot. Is that within normal behavior? Could it indicate something like a loop or an error where multiple files are being created unintentionally?\n\nI'm leaning towards NOT INTERESTING because these seem to be legitimate file creation actions by a known Microsoft Office process. The path structure also aligns with what I'd expect from Office package resources.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe if the same process creates many files in quick succession, it could indicate some unusual behavior. However, without more context about what's normal for this system and user activity, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI think the justification would be that these are expected file creation events by a legitimate Office-related process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a known Microsoft Office directory, indicating normal package resource installation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's look through each event.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of events where Excel.exe is setting registry values. That happens often when software runs on startup or configures settings. But doing it multiple times in a row could be suspicious, but maybe it's just normal operation.\n\nThen, I see some FileCreate tasks from SDXHelper.exe creating files in specific paths. These look like they're part of Office Solution Packages. The file names have GUIDs and terms like \"OfflineFiles\" which sounds legitimate for Office features like OneNote or Teams. It doesn't seem malicious at first glance.\n\nThere's also a DNS query from Excel.exe, which is normal for apps that need to resolve domain names, maybe for updates or cloud services.\n\nOverall, these activities don't show signs of malicious behavior. They fit typical software operations. However, the repeated registry writes by Excel could be worth monitoring if they're unusual for the user's environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activities, such as registry modifications and file creation related to Microsoft Office components.

This makes me think it's related to localization or Office's international settings. The repetition suggests an automated process during Office setup or updates.\n\nSince all activities are within expected Windows and Office behavior, there doesn't seem to be any signs of malicious intent here.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from EXCEL.EXE loading images like urlmon.dll and coml2.dll. These seem normal because Excel often loads these system files when running. Then, it creates a file in the user's Downloads folder, which could be just saving or opening a document. That doesn't raise any red flags yet.\n\nNext, there are several entries from svchost.exe modifying registry values. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process, often associated with services. Multiple registry changes might indicate something suspicious, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's just normal service activity.\n\nLooking at SDXHelper.exe, I see it's creating files in the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. That seems related to Office add-ins or customizations, so this could be legitimate user activity. However, seeing the same file path multiple times might suggest repetitive actions, possibly from a script or automated process.\n\nEXCEL.EXE again creates file streams for some .xlsx and .lnk files in various directories. The presence of Zone.Identifier stream indicates that these files were downloaded from the internet, which is common but could be relevant if they're being accessed unusually often.\n\nThere's an entry from HxTsr.exe modifying the registry as well. HxTsr isn't a commonly known process, so I'm a bit cautious here. It might be part of some legitimate software, but without knowing what it does, it's worth monitoring.\n\nFinally, Explorer.EXE making a registry change is normal since it interacts with system settings, especially regarding shell and explorer components.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the volume of registry modifications by various processes stands out. The repeated use of RegistryEvent tasks across different processes could indicate potential malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes. Additionally, while EXCEL.EXE's activities are mostly standard, combined with other processes' actions, it might contribute to a concerning pattern.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of multiple registry modifications and file creations, especially from less common processes like HxTsr.exe, could signal something malicious. The confidence is around 0.6 because while some activities are suspicious, others are normal, so it's not a definitive indication of compromise but warrants closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creation events by various processes, including potentially suspicious activity from HxTsr.exe and repeated registry changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the Office Solution Packages directory. The file paths end with .js, which makes me think these might be JavaScript files or scripts being saved. SDXHelper is something related to Microsoft Office, maybe a helper service. I'm wondering if this is normal behavior for such an application. Are these files part of legitimate updates or could they be malicious scripts?\n\nNext, there are events from \"chrome.exe\" involving file creation and DNS queries. Chrome often interacts with files when downloading them, so the download activity here (like Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx) might just be normal user behavior. The DNS query is standard for web browsing, but I should check if it's pointing to known malicious domains.\n\nThen, \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file seems like it's part of the log management process. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for collecting logs, so this could be normal operation unless there's something unusual about the file path or permissions.\n\nThere are several Registry value set events from different processes. These can be common as applications run, but sometimes attackers use registry modifications to maintain persistence. I need to check if these changes are expected based on recent software installations or updates.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE process has image load events for various DLLs. This seems typical since Excel would load several libraries when running. The specific DLLs listed (mscoreei.dll, mscoree.dll, amsi.dll) don't immediately raise red flags, but I should be cautious about any unexpected or unknown DLL paths.\n\nAnother point is the number of repeated events. For example, multiple FileCreate events from SDXHelper.exe for different .js files. This repetition might indicate something unusual if it's not part of a normal update cycle.\n\nI also notice that some events have null file paths, like when processes create registry values or perform DNS queries. These are more about process activity and network behavior rather than file operations, so they're probably less concerning on their own.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are several activities that could be normal user behavior (like downloading files, running Excel), the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe and the multiple registry modifications across different processes might warrant closer investigation. These patterns could indicate potential malicious activity or misconfigurations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, repeated Registry value sets across processes, and a high number of image loads in Excel suggest possible unusual behavior that merits closer examination.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object.\n\nLooking at the first part of the logs, there are multiple entries where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the task is \"Registry value set\". This happens repeatedly, 15 times in total. I know that Excel sometimes interacts with the registry for various settings or add-ins, so this might be normal user activity.\n\nThen, towards the end, there are logs from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths under the Office Solution Packages directory. These file creation events seem to be part of standard operations for software like Microsoft Office, possibly related to language packs or UI strings. Again, these don't immediately raise red flags.\n\nHowever, I should consider the context. If an unusual number of registry changes are happening from Excel without a clear reason, that could be suspicious. But since this is within a legitimate application's usual behavior, it might not be malicious. Similarly, the file creations by SDXHelper.exe are likely part of normal Office operations.\n\nI also note that there are no other fields like file accesses or network connections, which would make these events more concerning. Without additional context indicating something went wrong, like errors or unexpected failures, I'm leaning towards these being non-malicious activities.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing all the events together, I don't see enough evidence to classify this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry set operations from Excel.exe and file creations from SDXHelper.exe appear to be normal user activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

These files have names like \"gu-in-ui-strings-json_...\" and so on. It seems like this process is generating several JSON files with different language codes, which might be related to localized strings for an application.\n\nThen there's an entry from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the path where winlogbeat.yml is located. That makes sense because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration during installation or setup.\n\nNext, there are several events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing DNS queries and registry operations. EXCEL accessing DNS might be normal if it's trying to connect to a network service, but sometimes suspicious activity can occur through such accesses. Similarly, registry modifications by Excel could be standard for updates or configurations, but repeated writes might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThe other entries are from \"svchost.exe\" performing registry operations. SvcHost is a common Windows process used by services, so it's normal to see it accessing the registry. However, if these accesses are unusual in frequency or target unexpected keys, they could be concerning.\n\nPutting all this together, I need to assess whether the entire batch indicates malicious behavior. The repeated file creations from SDXHelper.exe seem legitimate, possibly part of an Office update or configuration. Similarly, Excel's DNS queries and registry writes might be normal unless there are anomalies in frequency or targets. SvcHost's activities are typically benign but could be suspicious if they're for a known malicious service.\n\nI don't see any obvious red flags like failed logins, access to restricted files, or network connections to known bad IPs. The events mostly involve file creation and registry changes which could be part of legitimate software operations. Without more context on the baseline behavior of these processes, it's hard to say definitively, but the activities don't strongly indicate malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate file creation and registry modifications by known processes such as Excel and Svchost.exe.
