Let me go through each event and see what's happening here.\n\nThe first few events mention processes like mmc.exe and powershell.exe. The tasks include things like \"Registry value set\" and \"Process Create\". Okay, that's normal because PowerShell is a common tool used for various tasks, including system administration.\n\nI notice multiple entries where powershell.exe loads images (Image loaded tasks). These are DLLs related to .NET and the CLR, which makes sense since PowerShell uses these libraries. There's also an event where a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 is created and then deleted. That seems like it could be part of script testing or policy checks in PowerShell.\n\nLooking further down, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe with the command line \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\\\teste.ps1\". The \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" flag stands out because it allows running scripts even if the execution policy is set to disallow them. This can be a red flag because malicious scripts often need to bypass such restrictions.\n\nAlso, there's an event where a file named teste.ps1 is created in the user's Downloads folder. PowerShell creating files isn't unusual, but combining that with the execution policy bypass makes me think this could be suspicious activity. It might indicate someone trying to execute potentially harmful scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe, which I believe relate to event logging setup in PowerShell. These aren't inherently malicious but occur frequently when scripts run.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple instances of PowerShell with execution policy changes, file creation\/deletion that could be part of script testing or persistence, and the use of .NET libraries for loading modules—it's possible this activity is indicative of a user trying to run unauthorized scripts or attempting some form of lateral movement within a system. The combination suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal administrative tasks.\n\nI'm not certain if all these actions are malicious, but the execution policy bypass raises enough concern that further investigation would be warranted. Therefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with execution policy bypass and file operations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got three JSONL entries here, each involving PowerShell.exe. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst event: It's a file creation by PowerShell, specifically creating a script with the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1. The filename looks a bit suspicious because it starts with double underscores and has a random-looking string before .ps1. I remember that sometimes malicious scripts use such naming conventions to avoid detection.\n\nSecond event: This is a file delete event, same script path as the first one. So, PowerShell created this file and then deleted it. That's a bit concerning because why would a script create and then immediately delete itself? Maybe trying to leave no trace, which is a common tactic for malware or scripts trying to hide their presence.\n\nThird event: Another file creation by PowerShell, but this time the path is C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This looks like it's in the Windows PowerShell Startup folder, which is a standard location for scripts that run at startup. But again, the filename includes \"NonInteractive\" and \"StartupProfileData,\" which might be part of legitimate processes, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNow, considering all three events together: multiple file operations by PowerShell can be normal, especially since it's often used in script execution. However, the combination of creating a temporary script, deleting it quickly, and then accessing a startup folder could indicate some suspicious activity. Malware might use such techniques to execute code without being detected easily.\n\nI'm also thinking about how these events fit into common attack patterns. For example, creating a file, executing it, then deleting it is a way to avoid detection by antivirus or logging systems. The fact that the first script was created and then deleted right away raises the red flag further.\n\nBut wait, could there be legitimate reasons for this behavior? Maybe some automated scripts run tests or clean up after themselves. However, the combination of multiple events involving temporary files and startup folders makes me lean towards it being more suspicious than not.\n\nSo, overall, I think this batch is interesting enough to warrant investigation because the sequence of actions—creating a script, deleting it, and accessing a sensitive folder—doesn't seem entirely normal and could be signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file operations by PowerShell.exe, including creating and immediately deleting a script in a temporary directory. This behavior may indicate attempts to hide or execute malicious code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
