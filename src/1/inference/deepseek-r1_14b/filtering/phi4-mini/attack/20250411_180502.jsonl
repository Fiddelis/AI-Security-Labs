{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from Chrome.exe showing network connections detected. That might seem suspicious because unexpected network activity can be a sign of malicious behavior. However, Chrome is a legitimate application that frequently connects to the internet as part of its normal operation, like loading web pages or updating extensions. So, unless these connections are to known malicious domains or show unusual patterns, they're probably not concerning on their own.\n\nNext, there are several entries from PowerShell.exe performing various tasks. I notice some registry modifications—setting values in the RegistryEvent rule. While PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, legitimate admins also use it for system management. The ImageLoad events show that PowerShell is loading modules like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, so they're standard and not malicious.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created and then deleted in the Temp directory. This might look suspicious because creating and immediately deleting files could be part of a script or payload execution to avoid detection. However, in some cases, legitimate scripts do this as well. The exact path here is __PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1, which sounds like it's related to PowerShell scripting policies testing, so that might not be malicious.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances where PowerShell is starting other batch files through command lines. Each of these commands seems to reference different script locations across various directories. This could indicate automation or legitimate script execution, but the paths don't immediately raise red flags. Without seeing the actual content of these scripts, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThere are also events from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe modifying registry values. Both of these are standard system processes; Calculator is a benign application, so such activity isn't unusual. It could be part of their normal operation or updates.\n\nOne event stands out where PowerShell accesses the Windows Defender Platform's MpClient.dll. This module is related to Microsoft's security software, which might indicate that PowerShell is interacting with antivirus components. While this could be malicious if trying to disable防护, without additional context like unusual access patterns or attempts to modify Defender's settings, it's not clear-cut.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the batch doesn't present a clear pattern of malicious activity. The combination of Chrome's network usage, PowerShell script executions and module loads, along with legitimate system processes modifying registry values, don't strongly indicate foul play. There are some red flags, like file creation and deletion in Temp, but they're not definitive without more context.\n\nHowever, the repeated use of PowerShell to execute scripts across different directories might warrant closer examination. If these scripts were attempting to access sensitive data or modify system configurations beyond standard operations, that would increase suspicion. But based on what's provided, it's possible these are legitimate administrative tasks or script executions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements that could raise eyebrows, the overall batch doesn't provide enough evidence of malicious intent to classify as definitely interesting for investigation. Therefore, I'd lean towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include normal activities such as Chrome network connections and PowerShell script execution, which are not indicative of malicious behavior based on the provided data.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the entire batch of events is interesting or not. Let me look through each event.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe doing registry sets. That's a lot—seven times. Usually, legitimate apps do access the registry, but seven seems excessive. Maybe it's normal, but maybe it's something else.\n\nThen, powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll and creating files like componente_principal.txt. PowerShell is often used for scripting but can also be abused by malware. Creating a file in Downloads might be suspicious if it's unexpected.\n\nThere are cmd.exe instances too, one running a batch script and another accessing the registry. Batch scripts can automate tasks, but if it's from an unknown source or doing something malicious, that could be bad.\n\nConhost.exe is also showing up accessing the registry. Conhost is usually for console windows, so seeing it do registry operations might be unusual unless it's part of a legitimate process.\n\n_svchost.exe creating a file in NetworkService's AppData sounds normal because svchost runs services, but I'm not sure if this specific path is standard.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes accessing the registry could indicate persistence mechanisms or data collection. The use of powershell and cmd with unexpected files might be signs of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's hard to say for certain, but the combination seems concerning enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry access by different processes including chrome.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe. Powershell creating a file in Downloads may indicate potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. So, I've got a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and my job is to analyze them as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first four entries:\n- Each shows that the process is 'chrome.exe'.\n- The winlog task is 'Registry value set', which means Chrome is modifying some registry settings.\n- There's no file associated with these events, as 'file' is None.\n\nSo, these are likely normal operations by Google Chrome. Browsers often tweak registry entries to adjust settings or for updates, so nothing suspicious here at first glance.\n\nMoving on to the fifth event:\n- The process is 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinLogBeat tool used for log shipping.\n- The task is 'File created', and it points to a .yml.new file in the data directory. That's expected behavior when setting up or updating configurations. No red flags here.\n\nThe sixth event:\n- Process is 'powershell.exe'.\n- Task is again 'File created', creating a file named 'elemento_base.txt' in the Downloads folder.\n- Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities. The creation of a text file could be benign, like scripting or storing data, but it's worth a closer look.\n\nConsidering all events together:\n- Four Chrome processes modifying registry entries are normal.\n- WinLogBeat creating config files is standard.\n- However, the use of PowerShell to create a file stands out. While not inherently malicious, it's more versatile and often used in attacks. The filename 'elemento_base.txt' doesn't ring any bells as a known malware indicator, but without context, it's hard to say.\n\nI need to assess if this batch is interesting enough for further investigation. Since only one event involves PowerShell creating a file, which could be malicious or just legitimate scripting, the risk is moderate. But given that there's only one such event among six, and no other signs of compromise, maybe it's not critical. However, because it's using PowerShell—often associated with attacks—it's safer to flag this as interesting.\n\nSo, I'd classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because of the potential malicious activity involving PowerShell. My confidence is around 0.6 because while there are red flags, they're not definitive.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a process 'powershell.exe' creating a file, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
