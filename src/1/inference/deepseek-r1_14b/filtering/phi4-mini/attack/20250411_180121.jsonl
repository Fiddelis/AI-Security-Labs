Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' and the task involves network connections or DNS queries. These seem normal because Chrome is a common browser and often makes such connections as part of its operation.\n\nNext, I see several events involving 'powershell.exe'. The command lines in these events look suspicious. They're using Powershell to execute commands that download files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. This behavior stands out because it's unusual for legitimate scripts to download files this way; it could be an attempt to install malicious software or retrieve payloads.\n\nLooking deeper, the paths being accessed are related to downloading LICENSE.txt files from various branches of repositories with names like \"objeto_base\", \"unidade_base\", and others. The use of raw.githubusercontent.com is a common method for distributing scripts, but doing this multiple times in quick succession raises red flags.\n\nAdditionally, there are tasks involving registry changes and file creations under the TEMP directory. These actions can be indicative of malicious activity as attackers often modify system configurations or create temporary files to execute further commands.\n\nI also note that some events mention 'FileCreate' tasks, which could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or creating backdoors in the system.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it's clear that the Powershell processes are engaging in activities that don't align with typical user behavior. The repeated downloads and file creations suggest potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances downloading files from GitHub into TEMP directory, indicating possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities. The first event shows that powershell.exe deleted a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Deleting files can be an attempt to cover tracks, so that's concerning.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe is creating or accessing processes and registry values. For example, the third event has a command line of \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems suspicious—maybe it's executing some script or command. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malware to survive reboots.\n\nLooking further, there are events where conhost.exe and cmd.exe are involved. Conhost is sometimes used by malicious scripts to interact with the console without being detected as easily. The cmd.exe processes might be running commands in a way that's harder to trace.\n\nAnother point is the deletion of a PowerShell script from the Temp folder. That file might have been malicious, so deleting it could mean they don't want it analyzed. Also, accessing other processes like whoami.exe and interacting with the registry further suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nThe events involving file creation and image loading (like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll) are part of normal operations for PowerShell, but when combined with other suspicious actions, it raises the alarm. The repeated use of powershell.exe with different command lines could indicate a script that's trying multiple ways to execute or avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together: numerous instances of powershell.exe performing deletions, creating processes, modifying registry entries, and using helper executables like cmd.exe and conhost—all these behaviors are common in attack patterns. The batch shows a pattern consistent with potential malicious activity, so I'd classify this as INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing deletions, creating processes, and modifying registry entries suggest potential malicious activities.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, a lot of them involve PowerShell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and lateral movement. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is accessing processes, setting registry values, and creating files. For example, one event shows PowerShell accessing the file 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt'. The filename seems suspicious—'entrada_base' might be a keyword related to malware or malicious activities.\n\nThen there's the use of cmd.exe with commands like SCHTASKS. I know that SCHTASKS is used to schedule tasks, but in this context, it's being used with '\/Delete' and '\/TN spawn', which looks like an attempt to delete a scheduled task named 'spawn'. This might indicate an attacker trying to remove evidence or disable monitoring tools.\n\nLooking at the Registry events, several processes are modifying registry values. This could be part of persistence mechanisms where malware sets registry keys to ensure it runs on startup. Also, the combination of multiple registry changes across different processes (like PowerShell and svchost.exe) suggests a coordinated effort, possibly setting up a broader infection vector.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run with no arguments, which might be used to check user privileges or system information. This could be part of reconnaissance activities before more malicious actions.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe appears multiple times creating files in the data directory. While this could be legitimate for log shipping, it's worth noting because sometimes attackers use tools like winlogbeat as part of their lateral movement or to exfiltrate data.\n\nThe event with RuntimeBroker.exe modifying registry values is another point to consider. RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process, but any unexpected activity from it might indicate tampering or abuse.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious activities: unauthorized process access, suspicious file creation, registry modifications that could be persistence mechanisms, and attempts to delete scheduled tasks which might cover tracks. These indicators collectively suggest a possible attack in progress or post-attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell.exe accessing processes, creating files, and modifying registry values, along with attempts to delete scheduled tasks using SCHTASKS.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key contains details about the executable that was run, such as its name and command line arguments. Winlog provides information about the Windows log event, like task names related to process creation, registry events, etc. The file key sometimes includes a path if there's file-related activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n1. conhost.exe is involved in a Registry value set.\n2. cmd.exe also does a Registry value set.\n3. powershell.exe accesses a process but doesn't immediately trigger any red flags on its own, though PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n4. whoami.exe is run without any unusual command line arguments—it's commonly used to check user information, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe running a REG DELETE command targeting the Run key under HKCU. This is interesting because modifying the Run registry entries can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware. If an attacker wants their program to run at startup, they might add it there. So deleting such an entry could indicate either cleanup after malicious activity or legitimate system maintenance.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times with different tasks: accessing processes, setting registry values, loading images, and creating files. This is a bit concerning because while PowerShell is powerful for administration, its flexibility can also be exploited. The file creation event in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory might suggest script execution. Malware often uses such locations to drop temporary files or scripts.\n\nAnother point of interest are multiple events where powershell.exe is called with \"& {}\" as command line arguments. This seems like an attempt to obfuscate or possibly inject commands, which could be a sign of malicious activity. The repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" tasks might indicate some form of persistence or module loading within PowerShell, which could be suspicious.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where reg.exe is used to modify the registry and cmd.exe deleting entries from the Run key, reinforcing the idea that someone (or something) is trying to remove traces or set up persistent access.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process creations, registry modifications, file operations in temporary directories, and obfuscated PowerShell commands. These activities could be indicative of a malicious script attempting persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. While some actions could be legitimate (like system admins using tools), the combination raises enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of process creation, registry modifications, and file operations suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows a process named powershell.exe with an empty command line, categorized under Provider Lifecycle. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, another PowerShell instance loads MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender, which is legitimate. Then, a file is created in the user's Temp folder with a suspicious name __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. That looks like it could be a script used for testing policy settings, but why such a specific and random filename?\n\nLooking further, Calculator.exe writes to the registry—normal for some apps, maybe.\n\nThen, there's a file deletion of that same .ps1 script in the Temp folder, logged as FileDeleteDetected. That's a red flag because it suggests something was created and then quickly deleted, which is common in malicious activities to remove evidence.\n\nI notice multiple events where PowerShell creates registry entries—this could be setting up persistence or altering system configurations. The fact that whoami.exe runs without any arguments seems odd; usually, it's used with parameters for user identification, so this might just be another process check.\n\nAnother event shows a new Process Create for powershell.exe with a command line attempting to delete a .zip file in the TEMP directory. This is concerning because deleting files could be part of a cleanup routine after malicious activity. The fact that it's using Remove-Item without much context makes me think it's trying to remove evidence.\n\nThere are also multiple Pipe Created events from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which might indicate communication between processes. While legitimate in some cases, combined with other suspicious actions, it raises questions about possible command-and-control or data exfiltration.\n\nThe combination of file creation, deletion, registry modifications, and process activity related to PowerShell points towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated registry writes could be setting up persistence mechanisms so that the malware can survive reboots. The empty command lines in some processes might suggest obfuscation attempts to hide what's actually being executed.\n\nOverall, while not all events are outright malicious on their own, the pattern—especially the file creation and deletion, multiple process creations with PowerShell, registry manipulations, and pipe creations—creates a concerning narrative that could indicate an attack or suspicious activity. My confidence is high but not certain, so I'd say it's INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving PowerShell processes creating and deleting files, modifying registry entries, and suspicious command lines which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Each event has process details, Windows log information, and file info.\n\nFirst, I notice several events involving powershell.exe with command lines that remove files from the TEMP directory. These are using Remove-Item cmdlets to delete specific .txt files without errors. This could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Deleting temporary files might be part of clearing traces, but it's not unusual in some legitimate scripts too.\n\nNext, there are events where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads images like mscoreei.dll and mscorée.dll. These DLLs are related to .NET Framework, which is normal for PowerShell scripts since they often use .NET components. However, the repeated loading of these files might indicate something more involved, like a script executing multiple operations.\n\nI see some file creation events too. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1 was both created and deleted by powershell.exe. This could be a test script checking execution policies or attempting to bypass restrictions. Such behavior is often seen in malicious scripts trying to ensure they can run without interference.\n\nThere's also an event involving winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this seems benign unless it's part of a larger malicious framework, which isn't indicated here.\n\nThe combination of multiple PowerShell processes, especially with command-line arguments that delete files and interact with the registry, raises concern. The repeated deletions in the TEMP directory suggest an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations. Additionally, the script testing policies could indicate a prelude to deploying malicious code.\n\nHowever, it's possible these actions are from a legitimate script or tool trying to clean up temporary files or perform system checks. Without more context, like timestamps or additional logs showing unusual access patterns, it's hard to be certain. But given the frequency and nature of the events, especially the file deletions and policy testing, there's a high likelihood of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes deleting files in the TEMP directory and accessing registry values may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So first, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe, which immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement.\n\nLooking closer, several events show powershell.exe loading different DLLs, like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. That's normal in some contexts, but the combination with other actions might be suspicious. Then there are file creation and deletion events—powershell.exe creating a temp file and immediately deleting it. This behavior could indicate an attempt to clean up traces of malicious activity, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that the command lines for some powershell.exe processes are using Remove-Item to delete files from the TEMP directory. The paths being deleted seem arbitrary with names like tarefa_base.zip and estrutura_geral.zip. This might be part of an attempt to remove evidence or perhaps as part of a script to clean up after malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries where powershell.exe is accessing the registry, which could be for persistence mechanisms—like creating or modifying registry keys to ensure that malware runs on each boot.\n\nThere's also an event involving chrome.exe setting a registry value and loading MpOAV.dll. While this might seem normal at first glance, it's worth checking if these activities are part of legitimate Chrome operations or if they're being exploited as part of the attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the consistent use of powershell.exe with file deletions in the TEMP directory, combined with registry modifications and process access, suggests possible malicious behavior. The fact that multiple files are being deleted and there's a mix of different commands executed through PowerShell points towards either an attacker trying to cover their tracks or perhaps running a script that removes various temporary files as part of its execution.\n\nWhile some of these actions could be benign (like legitimate script executions), the pattern—especially the repeated deletions in TEMP and registry changes—is concerning. It's possible that this batch of events represents a cyberattack, such as file deletion to remove evidence or establish persistence through registry keys.\n\nGiven all these factors, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are multiple red flags indicating potential malicious activity.

This is concerning because PowerShell is often used for executing scripts and commands that can be malicious.\n\n2. **File Operations:** Powershell.exe creates files, such as 'objeto_padrao.txt'. Creation of arbitrary files might indicate data exfiltration or establishing persistence.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:** Multiple events show registry values being set by various processes including powershell.exe and chrome.exe. Registry modifications can be used to maintain persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\n4. **Process Accessing:** Powershell.exe accessing other processes could be indicative of privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system, which are common in attacks.\n\n5. **Frequency of Activity:** The number of events involving powershell.exe and chrome.exe performing these actions is high, which might not align with normal user behavior, suggesting potential automation or malicious scripts.\n\n6. **Use of whoami.exe:** The execution of whoami.exe could be used to gather system information for reconnaissance purposes or to escalate privileges.\n\n7. **Lack of Other Processes:** No other significant processes are present, making the observed activity seem focused on a few specific areas, possibly indicating coordinated malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the combination of multiple file operations by powershell.exe, frequent registry modifications across different processes, and repeated process creations, this batch shows signs of potential malicious activities.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: A process named whoami.exe is created with the command line pointing to the system32 directory. The winlog task is Process Create, so that makes sense—when a new process starts, this is logged. Not immediately suspicious, but I know that sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nSecond and third events: PowerShell is accessed (ProcessAccess). PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by admins but also abused in attacks. However, accessing it doesn't necessarily mean something bad—it could just be a user running some scripts or admin tasks. Still, multiple accesses might warrant attention.\n\nFourth event: Another whoami.exe creation. Same as the first event, so nothing unusual here unless there's an unusual number of these processes.\n\nFifth event: Again, PowerShell is accessed. Now I'm seeing three instances where PowerShell is involved. Maybe the user is running multiple commands or scripts.\n\nSixth event: winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack for log management, so this seems legitimate. It's creating a configuration file, which is standard behavior.\n\nSeventh event: PowerShell creates a file called pacote_ativo.txt. The path is under Downloads, which is a common location for users to store files. The filename doesn't seem suspicious at first glance, but I wonder why PowerShell would create it. Could this be part of script execution?\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of whoami.exe and PowerShell activity. While neither individual event is necessarily bad, the combination might raise flags. Whoami.exe is often used to check user permissions; if paired with other activities, it could indicate reconnaissance. The repeated use of PowerShell is a red flag because attackers love using it for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nThe file created by PowerShell in the Downloads folder could be part of data exfiltration or storing malicious scripts. Without more context, like timestamps or source IP addresses, it's hard to say definitively, but the pattern suggests potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell access and file creation activities indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
