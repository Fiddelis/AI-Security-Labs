{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers. The first few events show file creation and deletion related to script files with .ps1 extensions in temporary directories. That's a red flag because malicious scripts might try to create temporary files to execute or delete them quickly, leaving less evidence.\n\nLooking at the command line of one process, I see it's executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which sounds like it's meant to capture keystrokesâ€”something a keylogger would do, which is definitely concerning. There are also instances where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs and creating files in different locations, including user-specific directories like AppData and Downloads.\n\nAnother point is the use of svchost.exe, which is typically used by system services but can be exploited by malware to hide processes. The fact that it's creating a file with a specific path might indicate some kind of persistence mechanism or data collection.\n\nThere are also entries from winlogbeat.exe, which I believe is part of the Elastic Stack for log management. Its activity here isn't necessarily suspicious on its own unless it's being misused, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nConsidering all these together, there's a lot of activity involving powershell.exe executing scripts, creating files in temporary and user directories, and using known malicious script names. This suggests possible malicious behavior such as credential harvesting, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration. The repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is particularly concerning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs that could indicate a security incident involving potentially harmful activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involve powershell.exe executing scripts with potential malicious intent, including file creation and deletion in temporary directories. There are indicators of suspicious script activity (e.g., Get-Keystrokes.ps1) that could be related to keylogging or other harmful actions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". \n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. The process is powershell.exe creating a file named 'objeto_temporario.txt' in the user's Downloads folder. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when combined with file creation.\n2. Then there are multiple chrome.exe entries setting registry values. While Chrome can access the registry normally, multiple such events might be suspicious if they're not part of standard operations. However, I'm not sure yet if this alone is a red flag.\n3. Another event shows whoami.exe being executed without any file interaction. Whoami is usually benign but could be used to check user privileges in malicious scripts.\n\nMoving further down:\n\n4. There's another powershell.exe process that runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which sounds like it's designed to capture keystrokes. That's definitely concerning because such scripts are often used for keylogging, which is a clear sign of malware.\n5. The subsequent events show powershell.exe accessing processes and loading various DLLs. Loading multiple system DLLs might be normal, but combined with the previous script execution, it raises eyebrows.\n6. There are several entries where the command line calls powershell.exe to run Get-Keystrokes.ps1 again. This repetition suggests a persistent attempt to execute malicious code, possibly indicating a script running at intervals or as part of a larger campaign.\n\nThe last event shows powershell.exe loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. While Defender might use such DLLs for antivirus purposes, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me more cautious.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) aimed at capturing keystrokes.\n- Repeated attempts to run these scripts from different paths suggest persistence or distribution across multiple files.\n- The use of whoami.exe could be part of privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nWhile individual events might not all be suspicious, the combination and repetition, especially involving powershell.exe running known malicious scripts, make this batch highly concerning. This activity aligns with common indicators of malicious behavior, such as persistence, keylogging, and process injection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious PowerShell activities including script execution for keystroke logging and repeated registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
