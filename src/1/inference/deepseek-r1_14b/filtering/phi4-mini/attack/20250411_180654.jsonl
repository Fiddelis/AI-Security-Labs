Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are from Chrome setting registry values. That seems normal because browsers often interact with the registry for settings. But then there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing files and processes. \n\nI notice that powershell.exe is being executed with command lines pointing to different paths like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. These scripts have parameters to log keystrokes to a temp file, which is a red flag because such activity can be used for keyloggingâ€”malicious behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are several 'Process Create' events for powershell.exe and 'RegistryEvent' entries from Chrome. The repeated creation of processes with suspicious command lines indicates potential malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, considering all these together, the batch shows multiple signs of potentially malicious scripts being executed via PowerShell, which is commonly used in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with suspicious command lines indicative of keylogging and potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries where the process is 'powershell.exe'. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands or scripts. Looking at the command lines in some of these events, they're running scripts with paths like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\tarefa_temporario\\estrutura_secundario\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". The fact that the script is being executed and logs keystrokes to a file (key.log) is concerning. Keystroke logging is often a sign of malicious activity because it can capture sensitive information like passwords.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where the task in winlog is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These might be normal operations for PowerShell when starting up scripts, but combined with the other activities, they could indicate something suspicious. The repeated use of these tasks suggests that multiple scripts are being loaded or executed.\n\nI also see some file-related events. For example, there's a File Delete logged event and a Pipe Created event. The deletion of a specific PowerShell script policy test file might be an attempt to remove evidence or prevent detection. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which could be part of a larger malicious operation, maybe to communicate with other processes or exfiltrate data.\n\nLooking further, there are instances where files are being created in various locations, including the TEMP directory and user-specific folders like AppData. The creation of these files by PowerShell might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or storing stolen data. The fact that some paths have 'tarefa_temporario' (temporary task) in their names suggests they're temporary files used during malicious activities.\n\nThere's an event where a remote command is executed, which could mean that the script is fetching additional commands or downloading payloads from elsewhere. This increases the suspicion because it shows active communication, possibly to retrieve more tools or instructions.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in different paths. It seems like the attacker is using a consistent script name across multiple locations, which might indicate a campaign or toolset being used. The consistency in naming could help in identifying patterns for future analysis.\n\nI also notice that some events are from other processes like winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe creating files. While these might be normal activities, the timing and combination with the PowerShell events make me question if they're part of a larger scheme, perhaps log manipulation or auxiliary process creation to hide tracks.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the batch shows multiple indicators that could point towards malicious behavior:\n1. Multiple executions of PowerShell scripts known for keystroke logging.\n2. File deletions and creations in sensitive locations.\n3. Remote command execution.\n4. Repetitive patterns in script names and paths.\n5. Use of temporary files which might be part of a cleanup or persistence routine.\n\nWhile some events on their own could be benign, the combination of these activities across multiple processes and files suggests a coordinated effort that's likely malicious. The high number of potentially suspicious actions makes this batch particularly concerning for investigation purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with potential keystroke logging, file operations, and remote command execution suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
