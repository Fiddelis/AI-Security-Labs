Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is \"chrome.exe\" with tasks like Registry value set and Image loaded. This seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the registry and loads various DLLs for functionality. The files mentioned, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, are legitimate Windows components, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNext, there's an entry from powershell.exe accessing a process. PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, but without additional context, it's hard to say. However, in this case, the action is \"Process accessed,\" which could be part of normal script execution or monitoring, not necessarily indicative of malicious intent.\n\nSince all these events are within known processes and involve standard operations (registry access, loading DLLs, process access), there's no clear sign of suspicious behavior like unusual file accesses, multiple failed logins, or unexpected network connections. The repetition might indicate a script running in intervals, which could be legitimate.\n\nConsidering the lack of anomalies and the nature of the activities described, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING.\" There's not enough evidence to suggest malicious behavior without further context or more concerning events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve standard operations by legitimate processes like Chrome and PowerShell, with no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed with 'ProcessAccess'. Powershell is often a red flag because it can be used for malicious activities like executing scripts or commands. However, in this case, the events just show that the process was accessed, not necessarily any malicious activity. So while it's something to keep an eye on, without more context, I'm cautious.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run. That's a legitimate system utility used to display user information. It doesn't inherently indicate malicious behavior unless used inappropriately, but here it's just executed normally, so probably not suspicious.\n\nNext up is cmd.exe with some command line arguments. The command seems to create and then query a service called win32times. Looking at the command: sc create win32times binPath= \"cmd \/c start c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\" & sc qc win32times. The part after binPath is trying to execute a script from a path that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That's a bit concerning because it suggests the script wasn't found, which could indicate an attempt to run something malicious that isn't present, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nThere are several entries where services.exe and other system processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, etc., are modifying registry values. These are common system activities, especially for services, so they might not be suspicious on their own. However, frequent or unusual modifications could indicate tampering, but in this case, without seeing the specific registry keys changed, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at cmd.exe again, the script path is non-existent, which could mean an attempt to execute a malicious script. That raises my concern because adversaries often use such tactics to hide their activities or to check if they're being monitored before executing something more harmful.\n\nOther processes like conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and chrome.exe are accessing or modifying registry values. These are standard applications that might interact with the registry for configuration purposes, so unless there's an unusual pattern or specific keys being accessed, it's unlikely to be malicious.\n\nI also notice a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe. This is likely part of log shipping or monitoring software, which is normal and not indicative of anything suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, while some individual events could raise eyebrows (like the attempt to run a non-existent script), the overall pattern doesn't strongly indicate malicious activity. The powershell accesses without any follow-through and the legitimate processes like whoami.exe don't add up to a clear case of compromise. However, the cmd command attempting to execute a non-existing script is a point of concern, suggesting potential malicious intent.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting but with moderate confidence. There's enough unusual activity to warrant closer inspection but not enough concrete evidence to classify it as definitely malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe accessing registry values, creating processes, and attempting to execute a non-existent script. These activities may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
