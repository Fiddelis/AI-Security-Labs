{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries from powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously. The initial logs show Process Create and Access tasks for powershell. That in itself isn't bad, but the command lines look suspicious. \n\nLooking at one of the command lines: it's running powershell.exe with a script that includes commands like net user, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe, and some dir commands on C:\\Users. These seem like they're gathering system info and possibly trying to access accounts or groups. The use of multiple backslashes in the command might be an attempt to obfuscate or make it look less suspicious.\n\nThere's also a file being created and then deleted quickly: __PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1. Temporary script creation and deletion is a common tactic to avoid detection, as it leaves fewer traces on the system. This behavior raises a red flag because it suggests an attempt to hide activity.\n\nAdditionally, several events mention \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These might indicate that Powershell is being used with certain modules or configurations, which could be part of malicious activities like script injection or loading arbitrary code.\n\nThe repeated Process Create and Image Load tasks further reinforce the idea that something unusual is happening. The fact that the same command line appears multiple times suggests a loop or repeated execution, possibly trying to stay under the radar by breaking down actions into smaller chunks.\n\nConsidering all these points together—suspicious commands, temporary file creation\/deletion, repeated processes—I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because several red flags are present, pointing towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines attempting to access system information and create\/execute temporary scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. So first, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event involves 'net.exe' being used with the command line parameter 'user'. That seems like a legitimate administrative command to manage users. Then there's 'powershell.exe' accessed, which in itself isn't suspicious unless it's doing something malicious.\n\nNext, I see 'net1.exe' also running similar commands as net.exe but for local groups. This might just be system administration tasks. The winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems normal since that's likely part of log shipping or monitoring tools.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command line with several operations: net user, get-localuser, etc. That could be legitimate admin work, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement or privilege escalation. However, the specific commands here don't immediately raise red flags—they look like they're querying system information.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe is accessed or creates files. Some of these might just be normal usage, especially if the user runs scripts regularly. The creation of 'elemento_logico.txt' could be benign unless it's part of malicious activity.\n\nThe events with 'Registry value set' under powershell.exe and conhost.exe make me think—why are they modifying the registry? This could be for persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations, which is a common tactic in malware. But again, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nOther processes like cmdkey.exe listing keys might be part of legitimate operations, especially if dealing with credentials. The notepad.exe and calc.exe events seem unrelated unless they're being used as part of an attack chain, but I don't see any indicators here that suggest malicious activity from those processes.\n\nI'm also noticing a pattern where the same commands are run multiple times—like net.exe, net1.exe, and powershell.exe. This repetition might indicate testing or probing by an attacker, which could be concerning. However, it's possible that these are just automated scripts running as part of system maintenance.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are some red flags but nothing concrete. The use of PowerShell for multiple system commands, the registry modifications, and repeated process creations could be signs of malicious activity. But they could also be from legitimate admin tasks or benign script executions.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because certain activities like registry changes and multiple PowerShell accesses might warrant closer investigation. However, without more context or evidence of known malicious behavior, the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe a 0.6 on the confidence scale.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of PowerShell and net.exe\/ net1.exe commands, which may indicate potential system administration activities or lateral movement attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is something that needs investigating. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. There are three events here.\n\nThe first event has \"process\": {\"name\": \"Calculator.exe\"}, and the winlog task is \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" with the file path pointing to C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll. I know that Calculator.exe is a common system application, but seeing it loading urlmon.dll might be interesting. URLMON.DLL is related to URL handling in Windows, so maybe Calculator is accessing some network functionality? That's a bit unusual for such a basic app.\n\nThe second event involves \"whoami.exe\" running with the command line pointing to itself. The task here is \"Process Create\". Whoami is typically used to get user information, and it's not malicious by default. However, if it's being executed from an unexpected place or in combination with other processes, it could be a red flag. But on its own, this might just be normal activity.\n\nThe third event shows powershell.exe accessed with the task \"Process Access\". Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers for command execution. The mere access without any other context can be concerning because powershell has many legitimate uses but is also a favorite tool for malicious actors. However, in this case, there's no indication of actual script execution or commands being run.\n\nNow, considering all three events together: Calculator.exe accessing URL-related functions, whoami.exe being executed, and powershell.exe being accessed. Individually, these could be benign, but the combination might suggest a potential issue. It could indicate someone trying to gather system information (with whoami) or perhaps attempting to execute commands via powershell. The use of Calculator.exe with urlmon.dll is less common and could be part of obfuscation tactics.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these events are definitively malicious, but the fact that they involve multiple potentially suspicious processes does raise some red flags. It's worth investigating further to see how these processes interact or if there are other related logs that weren't provided.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events involving Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll, whoami.exe execution, and powershell.exe access. These could indicate potential malicious activity such as information gathering or command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
