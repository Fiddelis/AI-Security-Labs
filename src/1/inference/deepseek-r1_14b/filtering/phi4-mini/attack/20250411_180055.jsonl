Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with specific commands. The command lines show the use of Compress-Archive in several instances. This suggests that the script is compressing files into ZIP archives and saving them to temporary directories.\n\nOne event shows a file creation of a .ps1 script in the Temp directory, which is then immediately deleted. This behavior is concerning because creating and deleting a PowerShell script quickly can be a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. It might indicate an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a trace for too long.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Registry value sets by PowerShell processes. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations, which is often seen in malicious activities.\n\nThe repeated use of Compress-Archive could be legitimate, like backing up files, but combined with the quick creation and deletion of a script file and the Registry modifications, it raises suspicion. These behaviors collectively suggest possible unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed executing Compress-Archive commands on various paths, creating temporary ZIP files, and deleting scripts quickly.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve powershell.exe processes. Powershell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting tasks but can also be abused by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious commands. The command lines in these logs show repeated use of Compress-Archive, which suggests that files are being compressed into ZIP archives. While compressing files isn't inherently suspicious, the destination paths are all pointing to the TEMP directory with various names like registro_principal.zip and modulo_temporario.zip. This could be a red flag because attackers might use such commands to package stolen data or prepare for exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the file paths, I see that they're accessing directories like C:\\pacote_temporario\\objeto_principal\\pacote_principal\\bin\\pacote_logico and similar structures. These paths don't look standard; they seem arbitrary, which might indicate that a script is dynamically generating them. This could be part of a process where malicious code is trying to access different files or directories across the system.\n\nThere are also entries from winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management and shouldn't raise concerns on its own, but in combination with other events, it might suggest that logs are being collected or modified, which could be part of an attack to cover tracks.\n\nAnother point of interest is the multiple registry value sets by various processes, including powershell.exe, conhost.exe, notepad.exe, and svchost.exe. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access across reboots or to execute code at specific times. The fact that these are spread across different processes might indicate an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice the loading of MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. While this isn't suspicious on its own, it's worth considering if the process loading it is legitimate or part of a larger malicious activity trying to disguise itself as antivirus software.\n\nThe repeated use of Compress-Archive across multiple events makes me think that this could be part of data collection or exfiltration. Attackers often compress sensitive files before sending them out to reduce network traffic and avoid detection. The TEMP directory is a common location for temporary files, so using it as the destination might help blend in with normal system activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple powershell processes performing similar actions, registry modifications across various legitimate-looking processes, and file compression activities in non-standard paths. These could be indicators of malicious behavior such as data collection, exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms. While each individual event might not raise a flag, the combination suggests potential malicious activity warranting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes are performing Compress-Archive operations on various paths, which may indicate data collection or exfiltration. Additionally, there are registry modifications and file creations that could be part of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is about.\n\nFirst up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory with .winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal since it's part of the logging setup, probably updating its configuration.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values. Both are legitimate system processes, so that activity isn't unusual.\n\nThen I notice powershell.exe appearing a few times with both 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' tasks. While PowerShell can be malicious, the events here don't show any suspicious actions like writing to unknown paths or using certain commands. It's possible it's being used for legitimate administrative tasks.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe entries all related to registry changes. Chrome often writes to the registry when updating settings or extensions, so this is expected and not a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there's an entry from whoami.exe being executed without any unusual command-line arguments. This tool is commonly used to check user permissions and isn't inherently malicious unless used in conjunction with other activities.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are normal system processes performing standard operations. While powershell.exe could be a concern, the lack of other indicators makes me think there's no malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as file creation by winlogbeat.exe, registry modifications by legitimate processes like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe, and process monitoring events.
