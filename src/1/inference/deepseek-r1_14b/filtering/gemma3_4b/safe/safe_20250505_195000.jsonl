{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event from the Windows logs.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that SDXHelper.exe is loading various DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. That's a bit concerning because repeated attempts to load these files could indicate something suspicious. Maybe it's trying to establish persistence or inject code into legitimate processes?\n\nThen there are events from taskhostw.exe, which I know is related to Task Scheduler. It's loading taskschd.dll, which seems normal since that's part of its operation. But seeing this multiple times makes me think—could it be a sign of something else going on with scheduled tasks? Maybe not inherently malicious, but worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNext, services.exe logs a logon event. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process for service management, so a logon here could just be normal user activity or system services starting up. Not too worrying yet.\n\nThere's also a special logon event without any associated file or process info. Special logons are typically related to things like remote desktop connections or system events, which aren't unusual but can sometimes be red flags depending on the context.\n\nMoving further down, SDXHelper.exe is making several DNS queries. That stands out because multiple DNS lookups in a short period might suggest it's trying to communicate with external servers. If these are legitimate, they could be part of normal operations, but without knowing what domain it's querying, I'm cautious. Malware often uses DNS for command and control.\n\nThen there are events from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is a tool used for collecting logs, so this is expected. However, the path in the file event seems specific—maybe part of the setup or configuration process. Not suspicious unless it's doing something unusual with that file.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe entries next. It starts a PowerShell instance and loads several DLLs from known .NET framework locations, which is normal for PS scripts. But then there are multiple ImageLoad events and finally, it creates a temporary .mdx.ps1 file in the user's AppData directory. The creation of an Mdx script might be suspicious because such files aren't standard PowerShell scripts. This could be a sign that something is trying to execute malicious code or test script execution policies.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are several legitimate-looking activities like service logons and tool installations, the repeated actions by SDXHelper.exe and powershell.exe raise some red flags. The combination of multiple file loads, DNS queries, and temporary script creation could indicate exploratory behavior, possibly by an attacker trying to establish a presence or execute malicious code.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the patterns don't align perfectly with normal user activity, especially the repeated attempts by SDXHelper.exe and the PowerShell actions. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context on these processes' usual behavior in the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe loading DLLs and creating a temporary script file, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of events from what seems like system activity on a Windows machine.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to powershell.exe and python.exe processes. Powershell is often used for legitimate scripting but can also be a vector for attacks because it has powerful capabilities. The first event shows that powershell.exe deleted a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1 in the Temp folder. Deleting files can be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers might delete logs or malicious scripts after execution.\n\nLooking further, there are several events where powershell.exe is creating pipes and loading different DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. I'm not sure if these are standard activities. Also, there's an event where HxTsr.exe sets a registry value, which could be legitimate but might also indicate some form of persistence or configuration change by malware.\n\nThen, switching to the python.exe processes, there are multiple instances where Python scripts and DLLs are being loaded. This isn't inherently suspicious unless it's part of a known malicious activity. However, the repeated loading of various .pyd files like unicodedata.pyd and select.pyd might be normal for Python execution, especially if running scripts that use these modules.\n\nI also see multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events for powershell.exe. These are typically related to the initialization and termination phases of a script or process, so they could just be part of normal operations.\n\nBut wait, there's one event where a file was deleted by powershell.exe. That might warrant closer inspection because attackers often delete evidence after executing malicious scripts. The fact that this is the only deletion in the logs makes it stand out more. Also, combined with other activities like pipe creation and image loading, it could indicate that some script was run which needed to clean up or was attempting to hide its presence.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of these events seem routine. Powershell and Python are commonly used tools, so seeing their processes isn't unusual. The repeated Provider Lifecycle tasks might just be part of the script's execution without any malicious intent.\n\nI'm on the fence because while some activities could be red flags, they might also be legitimate. However, the file deletion by powershell.exe is concerning. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but I think there's enough here to consider this batch as potentially interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a file deletion by powershell.exe which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one:\n\n1. **python.exe loading _ctypes.pyd**: Python processes often load various DLLs and pyd files as part of their normal operation. This seems routine unless it's unexpected in the context.\n\n2. **python.exe loading libffi-8.dll**: Similar to the first, this is a known library used by Python for certain operations. No immediate red flags here.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe creating a file**: Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool being run on the system. It's creating a configuration file, which seems normal if it's setting up logging or data collection.\n\n4. **SDXHelper.exe making DNS queries**: SDXHelper is often associated with software like Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP). Its DNS queries could be part of its monitoring or update checks, which are standard behavior.\n\n5. **winlogbeat.exe again creating the same file**: This might indicate that winlogbeat is running multiple times or retrying a process. Could be normal depending on setup, but it's worth noting.\n\n6. **SDXHelper.exe making more DNS queries**: Again, this aligns with expected SEP behavior. No anomalies here.\n\n7. **Another SDXHelper DNS query**: Consistent with the previous entries; nothing unusual.\n\n8. **RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value**: Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control (UAC) and handles elevation of privileges for processes. It's common to see it making registry changes, especially during software installations or updates.\n\nNow, looking at the batch as a whole:\n\n- The events span multiple processes: Python, Winlogbeat, SDXHelper, and RuntimeBroker.\n- There's repetition in certain activities, like multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper and repeated file creation by Winlogbeat. This could indicate normal process retries or periodic checks.\n- All these actions don't show signs of malicious intent on their own. They align with expected behaviors for each respective process.\n- Without additional context about unusual times, volumes, or deviations from baseline behavior, it's hard to flag any as suspicious.\n\nI should also consider if there are any correlations between events that might indicate a sequence leading towards something malicious. For instance, if SDXHelper's DNS queries resolved to known malicious domains, that would be concerning. However, without such information, the domain lookups alone aren't enough to raise flags.\n\nSimilarly, the file creation by Winlogbeat could be part of its setup or data collection process. Unless it's creating unexpected files in unusual locations or with odd names, this doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nRuntimeBroker's registry activity is typical and usually not a red flag unless it's modifying sensitive areas without proper permissions, which isn't indicated here.\n\nIn summary, each event appears to be within normal operational parameters for the respective processes. There are no overt signs of malicious behavior when considering all events together. Therefore, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING.\"\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are routine system activities involving known processes and standard operations such as loading DLLs, creating files, DNS queries, and registry changes. No indicators of malicious behavior were observed in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
