{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all related to Discord.exe except for one which is smartscreen.exe. The tasks include ProcessAccess, ImageLoad, ProcessTerminate, RegistryEvent, NetworkConnect, FileCreateTime, and FileCreate.\n\nStarting with the first few events: Discord.exe accessing processes, loading images, terminating, registry changes, and network connections. These seem normal because Discord is a legitimate application that would typically load modules, make network connections for its operation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to standard locations within the Discord app data directories. For example, the modules like discord_desktop_overlay.node are expected parts of Discord's functionality. The NetworkConnect events are also common as Discord communicates with its servers.\n\nThere are multiple FileCreateTime events modifying temp files in the AppData Roaming folder. This is typical for applications that might be updating or handling temporary data periodically.\n\nThe last event involves smartscreen.exe loading urlmon.dll, which again is standard system behavior for URL-related tasks.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. All actions are within the expected behavior of Discord and Windows processes. The files accessed and network connections are normal. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown file paths, or multiple failed attempts that might suggest an attack.\n\nSo overall, this batch doesn't raise any red flags. It's just Discord performing its regular operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal and expected activities from the Discord application, including process access, image loading, network connections, and file modifications in standard locations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few lines all involve \"MpCmdRun.exe\" which is part of Windows Defender. It seems like it's loading images and creating temporary files, like the .lock file in the Temp directory. That makes sense because defender might be updating or scanning, so these aren't unusual activities.\n\nNext, there are events from \"winlogbeat.exe\". This looks like a log management tool, probably collecting logs, so no red flags there.\n\nThen I see multiple entries for \"svchost.exe\" creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. Svchost is a standard Windows process for services, and it's normal for system updates or patches to create temp files here.\n\nMoving on, there are several events from \"Discord.exe\". It's accessing processes, changing file creation times, making network connections, and creating pipes. Discord is a known application that uses these resources for its operation, so this activity aligns with its expected behavior.\n\nI also notice some entries from \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading system DLLs, which seems standard as it's interacting with Windows components like COMBase and URLMon, typical for any helper process.\n\nLastly, there are multiple network connection events from Discord. Since Discord is a communication app that needs to connect to servers, these connections are expected unless they're connecting to known malicious IPs, which isn't indicated here.\n\nOverall, all the processes involved are either legitimate system tools, antivirus components, or common applications like Discord. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as unauthorized access, unknown processes, or signs of malware. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal system activities involving known processes like Windows Defender, Discord, and svchost.exe with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's look through each event one by one and see if anything stands out as suspicious.\n\nThe first few events are about Discord.exe creating pipes. That seems normal because Discord probably uses named pipes for inter-process communication. Then there's a reg.exe query checking the Run key under HKCU, which might be trying to see if Discord is set to run at startup. Not too concerning on its own, but combined with other events it could indicate something.\n\nNext, I see multiple Process Create events from reg.exe doing both querying and adding values to the same Run registry key. The command line for the add operation includes a path that might be trying to start Discord's Update.exe as a process. This is a bit odd because typically, Discord wouldn't need to register itself in the Run key if it's already running.\n\nThere are several Process Access events from Discord.exe accessing other processes. Not sure what those accesses are for yet, but they could be legitimate or could be signs of lateral movement.\n\nThen there's a File Create event by winlogbeat.exe, which I assume is part of some log management system. That doesn't seem suspicious on its own, but the file path looks like it's creating a new configuration file.\n\nA lot of Network connection detected events from Discord.exe—this could be normal for a chat app needing to connect to servers, but an unusual number might indicate something else. Also, a DNS query event which is expected if they're connecting to domains.\n\nPutting this all together, the reg.exe activity modifying the Run registry key with a command that includes starting another process (Discord's Update.exe) seems suspicious. This could be part of persistence mechanisms where malware ensures it runs on startup or tries to execute additional payloads.\n\nThe repeated Process Create and Registry events might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or modify system behavior in a way that's not typical for Discord. Additionally, the use of reg.exe in multiple commands is a red flag because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nWhile individual events might look normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity aimed at ensuring Discord runs on startup and possibly executing additional code upon startup, which could be part of a larger attack strategy.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of reg.exe modifying the Run registry key suggest potential persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes. Combined with network connections from Discord.exe, it raises suspicion of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL logs from a user's system. The goal is to determine if these events are interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process name is \"Discord.exe\". Discord is a popular communication platform, so it's pretty normal to have its processes running. The first few logs mention network connections being detected and some file creations related to Discord modules. That seems standard because Discord probably communicates with servers and writes data to its modules.\n\nThere are events where Discord creates pipes and files, like the \"Pipe Created\" and \"File created\" tasks. These are typical operations for any application that runs on Windows, especially those dealing with networking or background processes.\n\nI notice a command line in one of the logs showing Discord's GPU process. This is expected since Discord uses GPU resources to run efficiently, and such parameters are standard for optimizing performance.\n\nThen there are several \"Process accessed\" events for Discord.exe. Processes accessing each other isn't unusual; it could be part of normal inter-process communication or resource management.\n\nLooking at the files being loaded or created, they're all within the Discord app directory. Paths like \"\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\" and specific modules like \"discord_dispatch-1\" are standard for how Discord organizes its files. There's also a mention of ffmpeg.dll, which makes sense because Discord uses multimedia components.\n\nThe one event with \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading urlmon.dll stands out a bit. But SDXHelper is known as an overlay software that sometimes runs alongside Discord to provide additional features. It's not inherently suspicious unless there's something unusual about how it's being used here, but urlmon is a legitimate Windows DLL for URL handling.\n\nPutting all these together, the batch shows normal operations of Discord and its associated processes. The activities logged are typical for a running application, including network connections, file creations, process accesses, and loading necessary libraries. There's no indication of unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity like unexpected file modifications, unknown processes, or anomalies in access times.\n\nTherefore, these events as a whole don't raise any red flags. They fall within the expected baseline for a legitimate application running on a system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of the Discord application and its associated processes, including network connections, file creations, process accesses, and loading necessary libraries. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. First off, the first event is about taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's normal because Task Scheduler uses taskschd.dll. So nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, I see a lot of Discord.exe entries. The events show things like process access and network connections. But wait, Discord is known for accessing files and making network calls as part of its normal operation. The file creation time change on a temp file seems routine too—it's probably just Discord handling some data.\n\nI notice that there are 17 Network connection detected events from Discord.exe. That's a lot, but since Discord is a chat app with real-time features, it makes sense for it to connect frequently. There's also a FileCreateTime event which isn't unusual either.\n\nNo signs of unexpected processes or file accesses outside the expected paths. Everything points to normal operations without any red flags like unknown executables or anomalies in permissions.\n\nSo overall, this batch doesn't show anything out of the ordinary. The activities are consistent with Discord running as intended.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal operations of Discord.exe and system processes, including file access and network connections, which do not indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191300.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is something I need to investigate. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from the system logs.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all seem similar: the process name is Discord.exe and the task is \"Network connection detected\". There are several such entries—maybe around 9 or so. Then there's another event with winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its own directory. After that, sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll sounds normal because those are system processes.\n\nThen I see svchost.exe making a registry change. Svchost is a common Windows process, often associated with services, so registry activity from it isn't unusual unless it's doing something out of the ordinary. Then there are more Discord events about process access and file creation times. Some files mentioned are temporary, like .tmp, which makes sense for an application cache.\n\nWait, all these events seem pretty standard. The network connections from Discord could be normal if it's just connecting to its servers. The file creations and modifications by Discord in its own app data folder also don't raise red flags. Winlogbeat is likely the tool used to collect logs, so it creating a new config file makes sense.\n\nI'm not seeing anything that stands out as malicious here. No signs of unusual processes, strange file accesses, or unexpected network behaviors. It's all within what I'd expect from Discord running normally and some system processes doing their thing.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal operations of Discord.exe and standard Windows processes, with no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
