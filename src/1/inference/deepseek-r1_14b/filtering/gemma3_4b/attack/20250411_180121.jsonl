Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first five events are all from chrome.exe with network connection detections and a DNS query. Chrome doing these actions is pretty normal since it's a browser that connects to the internet and resolves domains. Nothing unusual here; users browsing the web would trigger these logs regularly.\n\nNext, there are several entries related to powershell.exe. The first one shows a registry value being set, which can be part of legitimate script execution but could also indicate malicious activity like persistence mechanisms. Then, I see a PowerShell command line that's downloading files from GitHub using WebClient. This is a red flag because downloading files from raw.githubusercontent.com might be part of an attack, especially if the paths seem arbitrary or unrelated to standard operations.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for various .NET and Windows DLLs. While these are normal as PowerShell loads these components, the sheer number might suggest something more complex is happening, like loading malicious modules or obfuscating code.\n\nThere's also a file creation and subsequent deletion of __PSScriptPolicyTest files in the Temp directory. This behavior could be testing script execution policies, which is common in attacks to bypass restrictions. The fact that the files are deleted after creation might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nThe latter part shows multiple PowerShell instances executing similar download commands from different GitHub repositories. Each command uses WebClient to fetch files and save them to the Temp directory with specific filenames. This pattern suggests a script running multiple times, possibly in a loop or triggered by different events, which is concerning because it could be indicative of a botnet activity or part of a larger attack campaign.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated downloading from GitHub repositories, coupled with attempts to delete evidence and set registry values, points towards potential malicious behavior. While some actions are common, the combination and frequency make this batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell downloading files from GitHub repositories and executing them suggest potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of events to analyze. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, the first four entries are all Powershell processes. Each has a command line that uses powershell.exe with some inline code. Looking closer, they're downloading files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory. The URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches or directories. That seems suspicious because Powershell downloading files from random repos could be malicious.\n\nNext, there's an event where Powershell is involved in a Pipe Created task and another where it creates a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\elemento_padrao.txt. Also, there's an Image Load event for MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender. That might be normal or could be part of malicious activity.\n\nThen, multiple Chrome.exe processes are setting registry values repeatedly. While Chrome can make changes to the registry for settings, doing this so many times in a row seems unusual. Could be tracking some behavior or persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking at another Powershell process, it's creating files in different locations like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive and modifying registries. This could indicate script execution trying to set up persistence points.\n\nThere's also a conhost.exe setting registry values, which is odd because conhost is usually for console windows. It shouldn't be making registry changes on its own.\n\nA Dns query event from process None might just be normal network activity, but without context, it's hard to say. Lastly, winlogbeat.exe creating a config file seems benign unless it's part of some log tampering.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple Powershell scripts downloading files and creating\/altering system files, plus unusual registry activity from Chrome and conhost. These behaviors could be indicators of malicious activities like script execution, persistence mechanisms, or potential lateral movement in a network. The repeated registry changes by Chrome are particularly concerning as they might be attempting to hide processes or maintain access.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because the combination of Powershell downloading files, multiple file creations, and excessive registry writes could signal an attack. However, I'm not entirely certain if all these events are directly malicious or part of some legitimate process. The high number of Chrome events making registry changes is a red flag, though.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of Powershell executing scripts to download files from GitHub repositories and creating\/altering system files, combined with unusual registry activity from Chrome and conhost.exe, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at a batch of system log events from various processes on a Windows machine. My task is to determine if these logs are interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate admin tasks but is also commonly abused in attacks. The events show file creations and registry modifications by powershell, which could indicate malicious activity or just normal scripting.\n\nThere's a cmd.exe process where the command line argument is \"cmd.exe \/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F >nul 2>&1\". This command deletes a scheduled task named 'spawn'. Deleting tasks can be part of an attacker's cleanup to remove evidence or disable persistence mechanisms. It raises suspicion.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event shows registry activity without any file path, which might be modifying system configurations—something attackers often do for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nsvchost.exe is involved in several Registry events. While svchost is a legitimate process, it can also host malicious services. The repeated registry changes could indicate an attempt to alter system settings or hide malicious activities.\n\nThe whoami.exe process running with the command line \"whoami.exe\" seems innocuous on its own but when combined with other suspicious actions, it might be part of gathering information about the user for later use in attacks.\n\nThere's also an instance where schtasks.exe is used to delete a task. This aligns with the cmd.exe event and suggests that someone is manipulating scheduled tasks, which could be malicious if 'spawn' was a legitimate or malicious task.\n\nThe file paths mentioned, like C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_base.txt and winlogbeat.yml.new, are from user directories. Malware often writes to these areas for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nTaking all this into account, the combination of powershell.exe activity with registry modifications, deletion of scheduled tasks via cmd.exe, and other system process interactions points towards potential malicious behavior. The use of multiple tools (powershell, cmd, schtasks) in sequence suggests an attack chain possibly involving command-and-control or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including powershell.exe process accesses and deletions of scheduled tasks via SCHTASKS.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The user has provided a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event. My goal is to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **conhost.exe**: This process is associated with the Windows Console Host. It's often used for running console applications, so it's common and usually not suspicious on its own unless there are other indicators.\n\n2. **powershell.exe accessed**: PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities like executing commands or downloading payloads. Multiple accesses might warrant attention, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\n3. **whoami.exe run**: This utility is typically used to determine the current user's identity. It's generally benign unless it's being used in an unusual context or combined with other actions.\n\n4. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Same as above; this repetition might be worth noting.\n\n5. **powershell.exe Registry value set**: Modifying the registry can be a red flag, especially if done by scripts that could indicate persistence mechanisms, like adding entries to run at startup.\n\n6. **cmd.exe deleting registry entry**: Using command prompt to delete a registry key might be part of legitimate system administration or could be an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.\n\n7. **reg.exe deleting another registry key**: Similar to cmd.exe, using reg.exe for registry modifications can be both normal and suspicious depending on the context.\n\n8. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Again, this repetition is notable.\n\n9. **whoami.exe run**: Another instance of running whoami, which might be part of user enumeration or lateral movement.\n\n10. **powershell.exe accessed**: This continues the pattern of multiple PowerShell accesses.\n\n11. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Same as above.\n\n12. **conhost.exe modifying registry**: Again, a common process doing something potentially persistence-related.\n\n13. **powershell.exe & {} in command line**: The use of \"&\" to chain commands and \"{}\" could be an attempt to obfuscate or execute arbitrary code. This is more concerning as it might indicate script injection or malicious scripting.\n\n14. **Same as above for next 5 events**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe with \"& {}\", which suggests a possible loop or repeated execution of a command line that's potentially malicious.\n\n15. **powershell.exe Registry value set again**: Another registry modification, reinforcing the idea that this might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\n16. **powershell.exe Image loaded**: Loading an image (DLL) could indicate that PowerShell is executing code from an external library, which can be a sign of malicious activity if the DLL isn't legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a significant number of events involving powershell.exe, especially with command lines that include \"& {}\", which is often used in attacks to execute commands. The repeated registry modifications and process creations also raise flags. While each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, the combination suggests a potential attack chain where an adversary is using PowerShell for persistence or lateral movement.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole appears interesting due to multiple indicators of possible malicious activity involving powershell.exe and registry manipulations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities including repeated use of powershell.exe with potentially malicious command lines, registry modifications, and process creations indicative of potential attack patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, the user has provided a series of JSONL events related to processes and file operations on a Windows system.

PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, creating temporary files, accessing the registry, and interacting with other processes.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n1. Several ImageLoad events indicate that PowerShell is loading different .dll files, which could be part of its normal operation but might also be a way to load malicious payloads.\n2. There's a FileCreate event for a script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1 in the Temp directory. Temporary script creation can be suspicious as it might indicate testing or dropping malicious scripts.\n3. Immediately after creating this file, there's a FileDeleteDetected event, which is a bit concerning. Why delete the file if it was just created? It could be an attempt to remove traces of the script execution.\n4. There are PipeCreated events, which can be used for inter-process communication. Malware often uses pipes to communicate with other processes or to maintain persistence.\n5. A 'winlogbeat.exe' process creating a config file seems normal unless it's related to some malicious activity, but nothing in that event stands out as suspicious on its own.\n6. Registry value sets and ProcessAccess events are common for legitimate software but could also be indicators of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'cmd.exe' with a command line ending in '\/c ', which suggests it's being used to execute another command, potentially hiding malicious activity. Also, the execution of 'whoami.exe' might be part of reconnaissance activities to gather user information.\n\nPutting this all together, while individual events might not be alarming, the combination is concerning:\n- Multiple interactions with PowerShell.\n- Creation and deletion of temporary scripts.\n- Registry modifications and pipe creation that could facilitate communication between processes.\n- Use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe which can be part of attack chains.\n\nThese behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the first event is cmd.exe setting a registry value. That might be normal admin activity, but I'll keep an eye out for patterns. The second event is conhost.exe also setting a registry value. Conhost is typically related to console windows; not sure if that's suspicious alone, but combined with others?\n\nThe third event is powershell.exe accessing something. Powershell is commonly used by both admins and attackers, so this could be either. Next, whoami.exe is run without any arguments, which is usually just checking user info—nothing bad there.\n\nThen there are multiple events of powershell.exe being accessed and modifying registry values. That's a red flag because attackers often use powershell for lateral movement or executing commands. Also, the command lines look suspicious; sometimes they have \"& {}\" which could be used to run other scripts or commands.\n\nThere are several ImageLoad tasks for powershell.exe, loading various .NET files. That seems normal for powershell but might indicate script execution or module loading. Then there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script name. Creating and deleting a script quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nThe last event is ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That's usually related to the Start menu or shell, so not too suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell instances accessing registry, loading modules, creating\/deleting temp files with script names—this looks like potential malicious activity, possibly using powershell for persistence or attacks. The repeated use of \"& {}\" in command lines might be to execute other commands silently. So overall, the batch is definitely interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell with suspicious activities including registry modifications, image loading, and file operations that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The user wants only one classification, justification, and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event. I see multiple entries where 'powershell.exe' is involved, sometimes with specific command lines like \"& {Remove-Item...}\". That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts or delete files. The command in question is deleting a .zip file from the TEMP directory, which could be an attempt to remove evidence or delete legitimate files as part of some other process.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where 'chrome.exe' creates registry values repeatedly. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, multiple writes in quick succession might indicate something suspicious, like a script trying to manipulate system configurations.\n\nOther processes include 'Calculator.exe', which is generally benign, but it's only one event, so probably not an issue on its own. Then there are entries from 'conhost.exe' and 'whoami.exe'. These are typically used for legitimate purposes, like running command-line tools or checking user information, but their presence in combination with other events could be worth noting.\n\nI also notice some file operations, such as creating files in the Startup folder (like the PowerShell profile) which might indicate persistence mechanisms. The ImageLoad events show that certain DLLs are being loaded, which could be part of legitimate operation or potentially malicious activity if those DLLs aren't supposed to be there.\n\nPutting it all together, while individually some events seem normal, the pattern of repeated Registry writes from multiple processes, especially PowerShell with a specific deletion command, stands out. This combination suggests possible malicious behavior, such as persistence, data exfiltration, or cleanup activities to remove traces.\n\nTherefore, after considering all these points, I would classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it shows signs of potential misuse through the use of PowerShell for scripting and file manipulation, which could be indicators of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe with suspicious command lines indicating deletion of files and possible persistence mechanisms, along with repeated registry modifications by various processes which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of the events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool and often used by attackers because it can execute scripts and commands. The fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe running catches my attention.\n\nLooking at each event:\n- Some events show powershell.exe loading various DLLs, like mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n- Then there's a file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1. Creating and then deleting a script file could indicate something is being tested or cleaned up quickly to avoid detection.\n- Several events show powershell.exe using Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory, specifically zip files. Deleting files might be normal, but the specific paths and the fact that it's done via powershell could be a red flag.\n\nI also see that some events have command lines with curly braces, which is unusual for command-line arguments. This makes me think these might be obfuscated or part of some script execution. The use of ErrorAction Ignore suggests that any errors during file deletion are being suppressed, which is another behavior that could indicate malicious activity.\n\nOther events involve chrome.exe loading DLLs and registry changes. While this isn't as concerning on its own, the combination with the powershell activities makes me more cautious because attackers might use multiple tools or processes to hide their tracks.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe for file operations in the TEMP directory, along with script creation\/deletion and obfuscated command lines, seems indicative of potentially malicious behavior. This could be part of a larger attack where an adversary is trying to remove traces of their activity or execute malicious scripts.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the pattern of events doesn't appear normal for legitimate user activity.

The second event is conhost.exe also setting registry values, which seems out of the ordinary too since I don't recall conhost being commonly used for such tasks.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances where PowerShell is accessing processes (ProcessAccess) and creating new processes (ProcessCreate). That's concerning because it might indicate a process spawning or command execution. Also, multiple calls to remove files in the TEMP directory using specific paths like \"tarefa_base.txt\" and others could be signs of malicious activity trying to clean up evidence.\n\nI notice a lot of events where PowerShell is loading various DLLs. While that's normal for scripts, the number might suggest some unusual script execution or potentially malicious code. The FileCreate and subsequent FileDeleteDetected events on \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\" are especially interesting. This temporary file being created and then deleted could be part of a script test or an attempt to bypass certain security policies.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with these specific actions—file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, process access—is a red flag for possible malicious behavior.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where PowerShell is being used with commands like Remove-Item to delete files in the TEMP directory. This catches my eye because deleting files can be part of malicious activities, but it might also be legitimate cleanup. The fact that it's using multiple similar commands on different files makes me think this could be automated or part of a script.\n\nNext, I see events from winlogbeat.exe creating a file. That's probably related to log management and shouldn't be suspicious on its own, unless there's something unusual about the path or permissions.\n\nThen, there are ImageLoad events for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. This seems normal as it's just loading a legitimate security component.\n\nThere are multiple FileCreate tasks by PowerShell in different paths. I'm noting that one creates .winlogbeat.yml.new and another an .txt file. Again, could be benign but might indicate script activity.\n\nLooking at the RegistryEvent tasks, both PowerShell and Chrome are modifying the registry. But I notice a lot of these from Chrome. Maybe it's just normal browser behavior, especially if updating settings or extensions.\n\nThe Process Create events for whoami.exe are interesting because it's often used to check user privileges. The fact that it's being executed twice might be part of some script testing permissions.\n\nI also see RuntimeBroker.exe accessing the registry, which is a common Windows process, so probably nothing malicious there.\n\nPutting this all together, I'm seeing multiple PowerShell instances with file deletions and creations, along with several registry modifications from different processes. The repeated use of Remove-Item on TEMP files is concerning because attackers often clean up traces after compromising a system. Additionally, the whoami.exe executions might be checking user context or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, some of these activities could also be part of normal script execution or legitimate software operations. Without more context like timestamps or related events (e.g., failed logins, unusual file access), it's hard to definitively say if this is malicious. But the combination of PowerShell deletions and whoami executions leans towards potentially suspicious behavior.\n\nI'm assigning a confidence level because while some actions are red flags, others might be normal, so I'm not entirely certain but leaning towards 'INTERESTING'.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances deleting files in the TEMP directory and creating new files, along with repeated Registry modifications from various processes.

PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because attackers often use it for command execution and lateral movement. The fact that it's accessed multiple times in quick succession might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are events involving whoami.exe being created. Whoami is usually harmless, used to display user information, but seeing it created several times could indicate someone trying to gather system details or check permissions.\n\nLooking at the other entries, one process involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent for Elasticsearch log management, so that's probably benign unless there's something unusual about how it's being used here, like unexpected file creation paths.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file named pacote_ativo.txt in the user's downloads folder. The filename seems generic, but since PowerShell is involved, it could be part of malicious activity like downloading or writing to files on the system without proper authorization.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple process creations and accesses with potentially malicious tools (powershell.exe) combined with file operations might indicate a possible attack chain. The repetition of these events adds to the suspicion, as attackers often test their presence or persistence mechanisms by running scripts multiple times.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if each individual event is suspicious on its own, but when considered together, there's enough concerning activity that merits further investigation.
