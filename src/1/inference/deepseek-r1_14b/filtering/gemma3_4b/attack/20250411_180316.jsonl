{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several entries from processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, and others. The tasks vary between Registry value sets, process accesses, image loads, file creations, and more.\n\nI see that svchost.exe is appearing multiple times with registry writes. Svchost is a common system process, but frequent registry changes could be suspicious. However, since it's a legitimate process used by services, I'm not too concerned unless the activity is out of the ordinary for normal operations.\n\nThere are also several instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being used with command lines that look like they're performing tasks. For example, the cmd.exe entry has a command line: \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete >nul 2>&1\". This looks like it's trying to delete Notepad processes. While this could be part of legitimate system administration, it might also indicate an attempt to cover up something or hide processes.\n\nAnother point is the use of WMIC.exe with commands to delete notepad.exe processes. WMIC is a powerful tool often used for remote management but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The command line here seems like it's trying to remove Notepad instances, which might be part of an attack to eliminate traces or prevent logging.\n\nI also notice that Calculator.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe are involved in registry writes. While these are standard system processes, their interaction with the registry could be monitoring or modifying settings, which might not be typical behavior depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the image loads, there's urlmon.dll being loaded by both calc.exe and WMIC.exe. This DLL is part of Windows for handling URL operations, so its use in these contexts might be normal, but it can also be used maliciously to inject code or handle network traffic.\n\nThe file creation event from winlogbeat.exe seems benign; it's probably a log shipper setting up files. Not a red flag here.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe) being used with commands that could be attempting to delete or hide other processes (notepad.exe). This kind of activity is concerning because it might indicate someone trying to remove evidence or disrupt normal system operations. Additionally, the use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes is a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n\nThe fact that svchost.exe and WMIC.exe are involved with registry writes and image loads adds more layers—while they can be innocent, their repeated activity alongside other suspicious processes raises the risk level. The overall pattern suggests potential malicious behavior, such as process termination to prevent detection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nI'm not seeing any immediate signs of data breaches or direct attacks in these logs, but the combination of using command-line tools to delete processes and unusual registry modifications points towards possible tampering or attempted unauthorized access. This could be part of an attack chain where an initial breach is followed by efforts to clean up traces or maintain persistence.\n\nSo, after analyzing all the events together, there's enough concerning behavior to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple process creations and deletions involving cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and WMIC.exe with commands that may indicate attempts to delete processes (notepad.exe) and potentially hide activity.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, the very first event has \"WMIC.exe\" loading a DLL file. That might be suspicious because WMIC can be used maliciously for remote commands. But I'm not sure if it's just normal activity here.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of processes like Notepad.exe, cmd.exe, chrome.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and schtasks.exe performing registry operations—specifically setting registry values or accessing the registry. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate activities, but they're also common in malware for persistence or configuration changes.\n\nLooking at the command lines:\n\n- The first \"cmd.exe\" has a command to copy an exe file and overwrite it: \"\/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". This seems concerning because replacing system files can be malicious, especially if sethc is often targeted by attackers for persistence.\n  \n- Another \"cmd.exe\" runs \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which deletes a scheduled task. If this task was created maliciously, deleting it could be an attempt to remove traces.\n\n- Then there's \"schtasks.exe\" being used with the same command to delete a task: \"\/c schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\". This duplication makes me think that maybe the system is trying to clean up after something else, or perhaps it's part of an attack chain.\n\nLooking at the processes:\n\n- Powershell.exe appears several times with \"Process accessed\" events. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can execute commands. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times without obvious legitimate use (like script execution) could be a red flag.\n\n- There are two instances where whoami.exe is run without arguments, which might just be checking user information, but in some cases, this could be part of privilege escalation or info gathering.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the batch shows:\n\n1. WMIC loading a DLL: Could be malicious.\n2. Multiple registry modifications by various processes, especially cmd.exe and conhost.exe.\n3. Replacing system executables (sethc) which is often a sign of malware trying to hide itself or replace legitimate tools with malicious ones.\n4. Deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks, which could indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms or clean up after malicious activities.\n5. Powershell being accessed multiple times without clear benign use.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination suggests potential malicious activity like system tampering, file replacement for persistence, and process deletion to cover tracks. This indicates that the batch is indeed interesting from a security perspective.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activities such as WMIC.exe loading a DLL, multiple registry modifications, replacing system executables (sethc), and deleting scheduled tasks.

I'm supposed to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. The events are in JSONL format, with each line being a JSON object containing process info, winlog task info, and file details.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or red flags. \n\nThe first event is schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal because schtasks is related to scheduled tasks in Windows. The next few events involve svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Svchost is a legitimate process for services, but sometimes it's used by malware. But in this case, the winlog is about registry changes, which could be normal or malicious.\n\nLooking at the command lines might help. For instance, cmd.exe with \/c suggests it's executing a command and then terminating. The event where whoami.exe runs without any unusual command line seems benign—it's often used to check user permissions.\n\nI notice multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry events. Powershell is powerful but often misused by attackers for execution or lateral movement. However, in this batch, there are several ProcessAccess tasks and some RegistryEvent changes, which could indicate script activity trying to modify system settings.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of cmd.exe with \/c. This might be part of a script or batch process that's automating something on the machine, but without knowing the exact commands run, it's hard to say if it's malicious. It could be legitimate admin tasks or part of an attack chain.\n\nThere are also events where chrome.exe is involved in image loads and registry changes. Chrome is a common application, so its activities are usually not suspicious unless it's interacting with unexpected files or registry keys.\n\nI should consider the combination of all these events together. The repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe, along with multiple registry modifications, could be indicative of an attacker trying to maintain persistence or move laterally within the network. However, without more context like timestamps or associated anomalies, it's hard to confirm malicious activity.\n\nOn the other hand, many of these events are standard system activities, especially registry changes which can be part of normal software updates or configurations. So maybe it's not suspicious at all.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because while there are some red flags like powershell usage and cmd.exe with \/c, they don't clearly indicate malicious behavior without more context.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a whoami.exe process being created. That seems benign because it's often used just to get system info, not malicious. But then there are multiple powershell.exe processes with different actions: Process Create, accessed, registry changes, image loading, file creation, deletion, and pipe events.\n\nI notice that the same powershell.exe is doing a lot of things. It creates temporary files, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1, which gets created and then deleted. This could be a script execution attempt. Also, accessing registry values might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe fact that powershell.exe is being used with ampersands in the command line (like & {}) makes me think of script blocks or executing other commands. The file creation and deletion within the same process suggests possible script testing or trying to bypass certain security policies by deleting the file after use.\n\nThere's also mention of Image Load events for various DLLs, which is common when running scripts but could be part of a malicious payload being executed through PowerShell.\n\nThe provider and engine lifecycle events are internal to Powershell and might not indicate anything malicious on their own, but combined with other activities, they contribute to the overall picture.\n\nAdditionally, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is legitimate software for collecting logs, so that event seems normal.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe instances making registry changes, creating and deleting files quickly, loading several DLLs—all these actions could be signs of script execution or attempts to establish persistence. It's possible that an attacker is using Powershell to run malicious scripts, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The quick file creation\/deletion might be an attempt to hide evidence.\n\nHowever, without more context like timestamps or seeing network activity, it's hard to be certain.

Let's look through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, multiple entries show powershell.exe being executed with command lines that check for specific .bat files. These checks might be part of a script testing environment presence, which could indicate malicious activity like checking if it's running in a sandbox or lab.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe loads various DLLs, such as MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. Legitimate scripts might load these, but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nNotably, several events show conhost.exe and whoami.exe being executed. Conhost is often used by PowerShell to run in a different window, which can be suspicious if combined with other actions. Whoami.exe is commonly used to check user privileges, which could be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe with specific command-line structures suggests automated or script-based activity. This repetition might indicate an attempt to execute commands across multiple files or locations, possibly spreading malicious behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows several red flags: multiple powershell executions, checks for specific files, use of conhost and whoami, and repeated process accesses.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice that most events are related to PowerShell.exe processes. The tasks include things like Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. Some specific file paths are being accessed, like clr.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These seem normal as they're part of the .NET framework. However, there's an event where a script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1 is created and then deleted shortly after. That's a bit unusual because it looks like the script was generated and removed quickly, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nNext, I see that some events are about file creation in specific user directories, such as AppData and Downloads. The names of these files seem generic, but I'm wondering if there's more context needed on whether these paths are typical for PowerShell scripts to be stored there.\n\nThen, the attention shifts to chrome.exe making multiple registry changes. While Chrome does modify the registry for things like extensions and settings, seven events in a row doing Registry value set might warrant closer look. However, without knowing the exact values being changed, it's hard to say if this is suspicious or just normal behavior.\n\nThere are also two command_line entries that run PowerShell with specific scripts. The paths mentioned check for the existence of .bat files and exit based on whether they exist. This could be a way to test if certain files are present without creating any new ones, which might be part of malicious activity. Alternatively, it could be legitimate script execution.\n\nThe events where MpClient.dll is loaded by PowerShell are interesting because that's related to Windows Defender. If this file is being accessed in an unusual way, it could indicate tampering with security components, which would be a red flag.\n\nLastly, there are two more Registry value sets and another FileCreate event for the StartupProfileData directory. This might be part of normal PowerShell profile initialization, but again, without context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this all together, while most activities could be benign, the combination of multiple registry changes by Chrome, quick creation\/deletion of a script file, accessing Defender-related files, and specific command-line scripts suggests possible malicious behavior. There's enough unusual activity across different processes that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe loading DLLs and interacting with system files, along with suspicious file creation\/deletion patterns and registry modifications by Chrome.exe may indicate malicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is a process creation of powershell.exe with a specific command line that creates a new file and sets content in another file. This could be suspicious because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, but I need to look at the entire batch.\n\nNext, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses something, writes to the registry, and loads images like mscoree.dll and others related to .NET. These are normal operations for PowerShell, so they alone might not be suspicious.\n\nThen, looking at the later events, I see multiple instances of Provider Lifecycle tasks with similar command lines creating new items in different paths and setting content in batch files. The command lines are repetitive but target different directories each time. This repetition could indicate a script running multiple times or part of a larger process, possibly deploying something across the system.\n\nThe use of Set-Content to write \"dir\" into these batch files is interesting because it's a simple command that just lists directory contents. It doesn't do anything malicious on its own, but combined with the file creation and the repeated nature of the commands, it might suggest an automated process or script deployment.\n\nI should consider if this activity aligns with normal operations. If the system runs scripts for legitimate tasks like backups or updates, these could be part of that. However, the number of events and the specific paths being accessed (like \"..\\\\modulo_secundario\") seem structured in a way that might indicate something more malicious, such as dropping files into multiple directories.\n\nThe high volume of similar events with slight path variations makes me think this is a script trying to establish persistence or spread components across the system.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell process with a command line that creates and sets content in some .bat files. It looks like they're using New-Item and Set-Content, which are common PowerShell commands for file operations. The task is \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which probably means it's related to the start or stop of some component.\n\nThe second event again mentions PowerShell.exe but this time it's a file creation event for a .ps1 file in the Temp directory. The path seems specific and maybe temporary, perhaps part of script execution.\n\nThen there's an event where PowerShell deletes that same temp file. File deletions can be normal, especially if scripts are cleaning up after themselves, but sometimes attackers might delete logs to cover their tracks.\n\nThe fourth event is about a pipe being created in PowerShell. I know that pipes can be used for communication between processes, which is common, but it could also be a way for malicious code to interact with other services or processes.\n\nLooking at the fifth event, another command line in PowerShell is creating and setting content in another .bat file. This repetition makes me think it's part of a script that's doing multiple file operations, possibly setting up some scheduled tasks or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe next few events involve image loading, which is typical when executables load other DLLs. These are normal activities for many processes, especially scripts and applications using various libraries.\n\nThere's an event where PowerShell accesses the registry (Registry value set). Registry modifications can be part of legitimate software installation but can also be used by malware to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThen there's a process create event for conhost.exe. I'm not too familiar with that, but maybe it's related to command prompt or other console applications. However, seeing it alongside PowerShell activity might be something to look into, especially if it's part of a chain of events leading to malicious behavior.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple image load and process access events for PowerShell.exe, which seems normal since scripts often interact with various system components.\n\nPutting this all together: There are several instances where PowerShell is creating files (especially .bat files), deleting temporary files, accessing the registry, and creating processes. The repeated file operations on different paths could indicate that a script is being executed multiple times or trying to create persistence points in various locations. The use of specific paths like \"..\\\" suggests attempts to reach certain directories, which might be part of a broader malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that there are both file creation and deletion events might indicate some form of cleanup after creating files. However, the combination with registry changes makes me cautious because attackers often use registry modifications for persistence or to alter system behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the process create event for conhost.exe alongside PowerShell could be part of a technique where an attacker is using multiple tools to hide their tracks or perform different actions. For example, using conhost might allow execution in a way that's less detected by some monitoring systems.\n\nI'm also noticing that all these events are from the same user account (judging by the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis...), which suggests a single process chain rather than multiple users being involved. This could indicate a targeted attack or just a legitimate script run by that user, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of multiple image loads and process accesses could be normal for a running script, especially one that's interactive or requires various system components. However, the specific actions (file creation, registry changes) are concerning as they can be signs of malicious activity.\n\nIn summary, while some events might seem benign on their own, the combination of file operations, registry modifications, and process creations, all under the same user context, raises flags. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate script or administrative task, but it could also be indicative of a cyberattack where an adversary is setting up persistence mechanisms or performing lateral movement within the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits several concerning activities indicative of potential malicious behavior:\n\n1. **File Operations**: Multiple instances of file creation and deletion in PowerShell suggest script execution. The creation of .bat files, often used for executing commands, could be part of a malicious payload setup.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: Registry access can indicate persistence mechanisms or attempts to alter system settings, common in malware for long-term presence.\n\n3. **Process Creation**: The use of conhost.exe alongside PowerShell might signal an attempt to execute commands in a way that evades detection or hides activity.\n\n4. **User Context**: All events are linked to the same user account, which could indicate targeted activity rather than random script execution.\n\n**Conclusion**: While some activities may be legitimate, the combination of file operations, registry changes, and process creations under a single user context raises concerns about potential malicious intent. Further investigation is recommended to assess if these actions constitute an attack or are part of authorized processes."}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are PowerShell executions. They all have similar command lines with paths that check if a specific .bat file exists and then exit either 0 or 1. This looks repetitive but seems like part of a script checking for certain files. It's not immediately suspicious on its own, but I should note how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, most are \"Provider Lifecycle\" which is related to loading providers in PowerShell. Some are \"File Create,\" \"File Delete logged,\" and others like Image loaded or Pipe Created. These seem normal for a process running scripts.\n\nI notice that some events involve files being created and then deleted shortly after. For example, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1, which is later deleted. This seems like it could be part of a script testing permissions or something else, but the deletion logged might indicate an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell accesses the registry and processes. These could be normal operations, especially for scripts that need certain configurations.\n\nOne event stands out where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads folder. It's a bit unusual because it's creating a .yml file, which is typically configuration data. If this is an application log file, it might not be suspicious, but if there's no legitimate reason for this creation, it could warrant attention.\n\nConsidering all these points together, while each individual event isn't highly concerning, the repetition of checking multiple batch files and the handling of temporary script files could indicate something malicious like a script testing persistence mechanisms or attempting to execute commands that require certain file checks. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, making the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions checking for specific files and handling temporary scripts suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first log shows the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's a legitimate tool used to check user information, so nothing suspicious there. But it's worth noting that sometimes attackers use such tools to gather info, though in this case, it doesn't look malicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's an event where \"powershell.exe\" is accessed. PowerShell can be used both for legitimate admin tasks and for executing malicious scripts, so I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLooking at the following events, several entries show PowerShell being executed with command lines that check if certain files exist. The command lines have complex paths with names like \"entrada_base.exe\" or \"tarefa_ativo.exe\". These checks could be part of a legitimate script verifying file presence, but they might also indicate malicious activity trying to see if specific tools are installed.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple instances where the task is \"Provider Lifecycle\". This typically relates to event providers starting or stopping. It's not inherently suspicious, but in combination with other events, it could be part of a larger sequence.\n\nThere are also several Image Load events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. These are normal as PowerShell relies on the .NET framework, so this isn't concerning by itself.\n\nOne event stands out: a process creation of powershell.exe with a command line that checks if \"unidade_comum.exe\" exists. The use of escaped quotes here might be an attempt to hide something or bypass certain security measures. It's a bit more complex than the others, so it raises my curiosity.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple PowerShell processes creating and accessing different files, which could indicate scripting activity. While some of these checks might be benign, the repeated attempts across various paths with names that seem arbitrary (like \"registro_temporario\" or \"estrutura_secundario\") make me think this could be part of a larger script trying to locate specific executables.\n\nHowever, without seeing actual malicious code execution or known bad indicators, it's hard to say definitively. The activities are somewhat generic and could fit both legitimate use cases (like system administration scripts) or early stages of an attack where the adversary is checking for existing tools before deploying something more harmful.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be alarming, the combination raises some questions about potential malicious activity.

This seems repetitive but each time it's checking a different file path.\n\nI remember that PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful and can do a lot of things, including executing commands, accessing files, and more. The fact that the same process is being called multiple times with similar command lines makes me wonder if this could be part of a script or automated process trying to check for certain conditions.\n\nLooking deeper, each event shows that powershell.exe is accessing different registry values or loading various image files (like mscoree.dll and others). These activities in themselves might not be malicious, but when combined with the repeated checks for specific files, it could indicate something more concerning. For instance, attackers might use such checks to verify if certain files exist before executing further actions.\n\nAnother point is that some events have a \"Provider Lifecycle\" task type instead of typical process creation or access tasks. I'm not entirely sure what this entails, but it's worth noting. It could mean that the processes are interacting with system providers in a way that might be normal but could also be part of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple powershell.exe instances checking for files across different paths, accessing registry and loading images—it seems like there's an unusual level of activity involving PowerShell. While not definitively malicious on their own, the combination suggests potential investigative interest. Maybe this is a script testing for file existence as part of legitimate operations or perhaps trying to avoid detection by exiting if certain files aren't present.\n\nI'm also thinking about how attackers might use such checks to determine whether they can proceed without being detected. For example, an attacker's script could check for the presence of a particular file that indicates a security tool is installed and then decide whether to execute payload code or not based on that check.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible these are legitimate processes, especially since some paths seem related to .NET framework components. However, the repetitive checking across various directories doesn't align with typical user behavior, which makes me lean towards it being more suspicious.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm about 75-80% certain that this batch is interesting for investigation. While not conclusive, the patterns observed could be red flags in a cybersecurity context.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes with command lines checking various file paths, indicative of potential malicious activity or script execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. All of them are related to PowerShell and other processes on a Windows machine. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loading an image (MpOAV.dll). That seems normal because Defender uses those DLLs. Second event is creating a file in the Temp folder with a random name, which might be suspicious but not necessarily malicious yet. Third event deletes that same file, so it's cleaned up after creation—maybe part of some script execution.\n\nFourth event: Pipe Created by PowerShell. This could indicate communication between processes or maybe just internal scripting. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nFifth and sixth events show PowerShell being called with command lines testing the existence of specific files. The paths are a bit unusual, but without knowing more about the system's structure, it's hard to say if they're malicious. Could be part of legitimate checks or scripts.\n\nSeventh event: another image load by Defender's MpClient.dll. Normal again.\n\nEighth event creates a file in the PowerShell StartupProfileData folder—probably related to user profile initialization. That doesn't raise flags for me.\n\nNinth event: Registry value set via PowerShell. This could be part of configuration, but without context on what changed, it's hard to assess. Tenth event is accessing another process, which might not be unusual if it's a legitimate process.\n\nEleventh event: whoami.exe execution. That's standard for user identification and permissions checking. Not suspicious unless used in an unexpected way.\n\nTwelfth to sixteenth events are more PowerShell executions checking for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 files in various paths. This is concerning because Get-Keystrokes sounds like it could be related to keylogging or data exfiltration, which are malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple attempts to check for and possibly execute a keylogger script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different directories. The repeated checks in different paths might indicate an attempt to locate the script wherever it's stored, which is a red flag for malware activity trying to ensure persistence or lateral movement.\n\nI'm confident this batch shows potential malicious behavior because of the repeated and varied attempts to access scripts with names indicating keylogging functionality.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, which could indicate malicious activity such as keylogging.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the events involve powershell.exe processes. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting but can also be abused by attackers. The repeated use of powershell.exe in different command lines and tasks makes me cautious.\n\nLooking at the command_line details, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being used with if statements checking for the existence of specific .ps1 files. For example:\n- C:\\registro_base\\entrada_base\\objeto_principal\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n- C:\\unidade_temporario\\registro_temporario\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\n\nThe pattern here is that the script is checking if these files exist and exiting with 0 or 1. This kind of behavior could be part of a malicious script trying to ensure it's not already present before executing, which might indicate an attempt at persistence or lateral movement.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses files related to Microsoft .NET Framework and Windows Defender. These aren't inherently suspicious, but combined with the other activities, they add to the concern.\n\nAnother point of interest is the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script in C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1. Creating and then deleting files can be part of an attempt to hide traces, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nThere's also a process where winlogbeat.exe creates a file, but that seems unrelated unless it's being misused. Since the other events are more concerning, I'll focus on those.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated powershell.exe activity with checks for malicious scripts and temporary file operations suggests potential malicious behavior. The confidence level isn't 100% because there might be benign reasons for these actions, but the pattern is worrying enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts with potentially malicious intent, including file creation\/deletion and checking for specific script presence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe doing various tasks like file creation, registry edits, and process accesses. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities. But I don't see any overtly suspicious actions here yet—just standard operations.\n\nThen there are two instances of whoami.exe being executed with the command line pointing to its system32 location. Whoami is typically benign, but sometimes attackers use it to check permissions or user info. However, without seeing additional actions after that, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nNotepad.exe creating a registry value isn't unusual either, as many applications do that during setup. Not a red flag here.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting. I know that legitimate processes sometimes load system DLLs, but urlmon is associated with URL handling and could be used by malware to bypass restrictions. This event might warrant closer inspection, especially if it's paired with other actions.\n\nsvchost.exe setting registry values and making network connections could be suspicious since svchost is a common process that can be hijacked by malware. Malicious actors often use it for persistence or communication.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe creating a file seems normal unless it's part of an attack on the log system, but there's no indication of tampering here.\n\nLooking at all these events together: multiple powershell.exe activities, some registry edits by svchost and notepad, calc loading urlmon, and extensive chrome.exe network connections. The combination could indicate a potential attack—using powershell for command execution, persistence via svchost, info gathering with whoami, and perhaps lateral movement or data exfiltration through chrome.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because of the suspicious activities across different processes, especially the use of multiple tools that are common in attacks. The confidence isn't super high but there's enough concerning behavior to merit investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe, whoami.exe, and svchost.exe with potentially malicious activities such as registry modifications and network connections suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a Chrome.exe process with a DNS query. That seems normal since browsers do perform DNS lookups regularly. Not too concerning on its own.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed, which immediately raises an eyebrow because PowerShell can be used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. I'll keep this in mind as I go through more events.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed without any file access mentioned, so that might not be suspicious by itself—it could just be a user checking their permissions or system info.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe is accessed again, followed by accessing registry values. This combination—accessing the registry after starting PowerShell—is something attackers often do to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. It's a red flag but I need more context.\n\nThere are multiple Image Load events for different DLLs when running PowerShell scripts. This could be normal if they're part of legitimate script execution, but sometimes attackers use these loads to inject malicious code or load libraries from unexpected paths.\n\nI notice a file being created and then immediately deleted in the same process. Creating temporary files is common, especially in scripting, but the deletion might indicate an attempt to remove traces. However, without knowing the script's content, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe Pipe Created event could be part of legitimate communication between processes or scripts, but pipes can also be used for command and control in some attacks.\n\nLooking at the command lines, I see PowerShell executing commands like \"ls -recurse\" and \"get-childitem -recurse.\" These are standard directory listing commands. However, when combined with other activities like registry access and file creation\/deletion, it could indicate a script that's enumerating system info or attempting to gather data.\n\nThe fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might suggest automation or an attempt to ensure persistence across reboots, which is common in malware.\n\nConsidering all these events together: repeated PowerShell executions with commands that can be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement, accessing the registry (often used for persistence), creating and deleting temporary files, loading various DLLs—this combination is indicative of potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't 100% because some actions could be legitimate, but the pattern strongly suggests investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious commands, including file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and repeated process creations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple entries involve powershell.exe and winlogbeat.exe. The command lines in the process field show commands like 'ls -recurse' and 'get-childitem -recurse'. These are common PowerShell commands used to list files and directories recursively, so they could be part of legitimate file management tasks.\n\nLooking at the winlog entries, most tasks are things like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, Registry value set, and Process accessed. These seem like standard Windows events that occur during normal operations, especially when scripts or tools run. For example, Image loaded would happen when an executable is started, which makes sense for powershell.exe.\n\nThere's also a file entry pointing to MpClient.dll, which is part of Microsoft Defender. That’s entirely normal and doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nI see two events where winlogbeat.exe creates files in the data directory with paths ending in .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs, so this activity aligns with its function, meaning it's setting up or updating configuration files.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file named estrutura_secundario.txt in the Downloads folder. Without more context, this could be any script outputting data. It doesn't inherently seem malicious, especially since other events are just running standard commands.\n\nThe registry value sets and process accesses might be part of normal scripting or tool behavior. If a script is modifying the registry to make changes persistent or accessing processes for some reason, it's not unusual in legitimate scripts, though it could also be malicious. However, given that these events are alongside others that seem routine, I'm leaning towards them being part of normal operations.\n\nPutting all this together, while each individual event might look suspicious on its own, especially the powershell.exe commands and registry modifications, the combination here seems more like a legitimate activity. It appears someone is running PowerShell scripts to list files and directories, possibly setting up configuration for tools like winlogbeat, which could be part of system administration tasks or security monitoring setup.\n\nI don't see any red flags like multiple failed logins, execution of known malicious binaries, or indicators of compromise such as file hashes. The paths involved are standard locations where user scripts might write files, and the processes are typical for running scripts and tools on Windows.\n\nSo overall, while it's always good to keep an eye on PowerShell usage due to its common use in attacks, the absence of overtly malicious behaviors and the presence of tool-related activities suggest this batch isn't particularly concerning. It could be a user performing routine tasks or setting up monitoring tools.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal PowerShell commands for file management, legitimate Windows processes, and setup of monitoring tools like winlogbeat.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
