{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a DNS query from chrome.exe. That seems normal because browsers do that all the time. Next is powershell.exe accessing registry values and then being accessed again. PowerShell can be malicious, but it's also commonly used for system admin tasks, so I'll keep an eye on this.\n\nThen, cmd.exe runs 'systeminfo' which lists system information. That could be part of a routine check or could indicate someone gathering info before an attack. The command line includes a registry query, which might be trying to access sensitive data.\n\nThere's another powershell.exe process being accessed, so maybe it's interacting with other processes. Then cmd.exe again sets a registry value, and systeminfo.exe is running, loading some DLLs. Those DLLs are standard Windows ones, but sometimes malicious software also loads legitimate modules to hide better.\n\nNotepad.exe writing to the registry—probably saving something, but not suspicious on its own. Powershell.exe accessed again; I'm wondering if these accesses are part of a script or something more nefarious.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that seems odd because calculator shouldn't need that DLL, which is related to URL handling. Maybe an indication of some malicious activity trying to hide by using common processes.\n\nMultiple events from svchost.exe creating files and modifying the registry—svchost is a legitimate process but can be used by malware. The fact that it's creating log files might be for persistence or to cover its tracks.\n\nWmiPrvSE.exe, which I know is related to WMI, is starting with specific parameters. That could be normal, but sometimes attackers use WMI for remote commands or persistence.\n\nLooking at all these together: a lot of legitimate processes like chrome, powershell, cmd, systeminfo, calculator, and svchost are involved in various activities. However, the combination might raise flags. The repeated use of powershell and cmd with registry queries could be data gathering. The calc.exe loading urlmon is odd because it's unexpected.\n\nI'm thinking this batch shows a potential script or tool being used to gather information about the system (like IP configuration) and possibly trying to hide by using common processes and modules. There are signs that might indicate reconnaissance or early stages of an attack, like checking disk drives or loading DLLs that could be part of malicious activities.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible these are just routine admin tasks. But given the number of process creations, registry accesses, and odd behaviors (like calc.exe with urlmon), I'm leaning towards this being interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of legitimate processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing actions that could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement, such as registry modifications and process creations. The use of systeminfo.exe and reg.exe for querying system information and registry entries may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm presented with a batch of system log events and need to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is typically an agent used for forwarding logs, so this might be part of its normal operation—logging or configuration changes.\n\nNext, 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and several instances of 'powershell.exe' setting registry values. Powershell being involved could be concerning because it's often used by attackers for scripting. However, legitimate uses are also common, like system administration tasks.\n\nThere are multiple entries from 'chrome.exe' creating pipes, accessing processes, and loading images like 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll'. These seem normal as Chrome would interact with system components. The repeated registry value sets by Chrome might be part of its operation but could also indicate suspicious activity if they're accessing or modifying sensitive areas.\n\nI notice that several events involve 'winlogbeat.exe' creating files, which again seems related to log management and probably not malicious unless it's accessing unexpected locations.\n\nAnother event has 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_padrao.txt'. The filename is in Portuguese, meaning \"standard object\". This might be part of legitimate script execution, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, PowerShell file creation could be related to dropping files as part of malicious activities.\n\nThe overall picture shows various processes performing standard operations like creating files, accessing registry keys, and loading system libraries. There are multiple instances where Chrome is making changes, which might just be its normal behavior but could also suggest some form of compromise if these actions are out of the ordinary for the user's environment.\n\nHowever, there aren't clear indicators of malicious activity such as unusual file paths, execution from untrusted sources, or known malicious process names. The high frequency of Chrome events setting registry values stands out, but without more context on what those specific registry modifications entail, it's difficult to classify this batch as definitely suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'NOT INTERESTING' because while there are multiple events and some could be red flags, none strongly indicate malicious behavior when considered together. The events seem more like normal system operations with a few potential anomalies that aren't severe enough on their own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains mostly standard system activities such as file creation, registry modifications, and process loading, which do not indicate malicious behavior. While some events from PowerShell and Chrome could be concerning, there is no clear evidence of suspicious patterns or known attack indicators when analyzed as a whole.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nThe first thing that catches my eye is the process name \"chrome.exe\". Chrome is a common application, and its processes are pretty standard. But sometimes malicious actors might disguise their activities under legitimate-sounding processes. So I can't rule that out entirely.\n\nLooking at the windows log entry: it mentions a Registry value being set. That's interesting because changing registry values can be part of system configuration or persistence mechanisms used by malware. It could be setting a new key, modifying an existing one, which might allow the malicious code to persist across reboots or execute certain actions at startup.\n\nThe file field is None in this event, so there's no direct file access being logged here. That means the activity isn't tied to reading, writing, or deleting files, but it's still significant because registry modifications can be just as harmful.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about what a malicious actor might do with the registry. They could create or modify keys to achieve persistence, alter system configurations to make detection harder, or even change security settings to allow further privilege escalation. On the other hand, legitimate software also modifies the registry during installation or operation, so it's not always suspicious.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might be common, together they could indicate something more nefarious. The combination of a known but commonly exploited process and a registry modification is a red flag that needs closer examination.\n\nAs for confidence, I'd say around 0.7. It's not a certainty, but there are enough indicators here to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The event shows 'chrome.exe' modifying the Windows registry, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms or system configuration tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
