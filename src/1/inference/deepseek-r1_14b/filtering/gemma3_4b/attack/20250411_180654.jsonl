{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nFirst, several entries have the command line running powershell.exe with a script named Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script seems to be logging keystrokes and saving them to a temp file (key.log). Keystroke loggers are often used maliciously, so that catches my attention.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1. It then deletes this file shortly after. This behavior might be trying to bypass certain script execution policies by creating and deleting temporary scripts quickly. That sounds suspicious.\n\nLooking at other events, I see that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs from Windows Defender directories and interacting with the registry. While some of these are normal for PowerShell operations, the repeated calls and specific tasks like Provider Lifecycle or Engine Lifecycle might indicate something unusual, especially when combined with the keystroke activity.\n\nThere's also an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is typically related to console windows but can sometimes be used maliciously as part of process injection techniques.\n\nAdditionally, a remote command execution event is logged. This could be indicative of command-line attacks or remote code execution vulnerabilities being exploited.\n\nI'm noticing that multiple processes are involved, including svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. While these might seem benign, the combination with other events raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe running keystroke logging scripts, temporary script creation\/deletion, remote command execution, and unusual file creations across different user directories. These activities are red flags for potential malicious behavior. The confidence is high because several indicators point towards possible unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which logs keystrokes to a temp file, along with other suspicious activities like temporary script creation and deletion, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events. There are three JSON objects here, each representing a different event.\n\nFirst, the process names are svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and powershell.exe. Svchost is known to be legitimate but sometimes used by malware because it's a common system process. Winlogbeat seems like it could be related to log management or an agent, which might not be malicious on its own. Powershell is widely used for both good and bad purposes; it's often targeted by attackers.\n\nLooking at the file paths:\n\n1. The first file path is C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. That seems like a standard Windows directory, part of Delivery Optimization which manages how updates are delivered. So this might just be normal system activity.\n\n2. The second file is in a user's Downloads folder with winlogbeat.yml.new. Since it's an agent's config file, and the process was winlogbeat.exe, this could be related to setting up logging or monitoring tools. Not inherently malicious unless there's more context about how it's being used.\n\n3. The third event has powershell.exe creating a new file in the Downloads folder called entrada_padrao.txt. Powershell is versatile; while it can execute scripts and create files, without seeing the content of this file, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. However, creating new files isn't unusual.\n\nNow, considering all together: we have system processes, a log agent, and powershell. None of these individually raise red flags, but I'm concerned about how they're being used. The creation of several files by different processes might be part of a legitimate operation, or it could be an attacker trying to establish persistence or drop malicious payloads.\n\nThe justification is that the batch shows multiple file creations by known tools which could either be normal admin activity or signs of lateral movement. The confidence isn't too high because there's no clear indication of malicious intent yet, but these activities are worth monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by different processes, including powershell.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting enough for further investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event involves powershell.exe creating a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. I should keep an eye out for anything suspicious here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. That's a bit unusual because Chrome doesn't typically modify the registry unless it's part of some customization or extension activity. But since it's happening several times, maybe it's worth looking into if these modifications are legitimate.\n\nLooking further, I see more powershell.exe processes accessing and creating files, along with some command lines that reference scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script name sounds malicious; keystroke loggers are often used by attackers to capture sensitive information. The fact that it's being executed multiple times from different paths is concerning.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process running without any command line arguments. While whoami is generally harmless, its execution might be part of a larger sequence of actions, especially since it's paired with other suspicious activities like the PowerShell scripts.\n\nThe batch includes several events where powershell.exe is loading various .NET framework components. This isn't inherently malicious, but combined with the script execution, it might indicate that the script is doing something more complex in the background.\n\nAdditionally, there are two events with command lines invoking Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths, both under the 'Provider Lifecycle' task. This repetition suggests a pattern of activity that could be part of an ongoing malicious process.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to execute scripts known for keystroke logging, coupled with registry modifications and process creations, paints a concerning picture. These activities are often indicators of potential malware or unauthorized access. The confidence in this being interesting is high because multiple red flags align with common attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including PowerShell executions, registry modifications, and potentially malicious script invocations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
