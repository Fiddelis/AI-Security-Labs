{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. There are a lot of events here, so I'll go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve 'chrome.exe' with tasks like 'Registry value set', 'Dns query', and 'Network connection detected'. These seem normal because Chrome is a common browser that interacts with registries, DNS, and network traffic. \n\nI notice there are several RegistryEvent tasks in Chrome. While it's not uncommon for applications to modify the registry, repeated writes could be suspicious. But since they're all from Chrome, which is legitimate, this might just be its regular operation.\n\nThere are also a couple of DnsQuery events from 'chrome.exe' and one from 'None'. DNS queries can be part of normal browsing activity, so that's not too concerning on its own.\n\nLooking at the FileCreate tasks, I see two entries. One is from 'winlogbeat.exe', which is probably part of logging setup. The other is from 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so this might be worth looking into. However, without more context on what's in that file or how it was created, it's hard to say.\n\nThe ImageLoad events load standard system files like 'amsi.dll' and 'MpOAV.dll', which are related to anti-malware scans and Windows Defender. These are normal and expected.\n\nThere's a NetworkConnect event from Chrome as well, which again is part of its operation when accessing websites.\n\nPutting it all together, most events are typical for Chrome and other system processes. The only thing that stands out is the file created by PowerShell. It could be benign, like script output, but without more info, it's hard to assess. Since there's no clear indication of malicious activity across the batch as a whole, I'm leaning towards this being not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly normal user activities from Chrome and system processes with no evident signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a Windows system.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the first event is the execution of whoami.exe. That's usually a benign command used to check user information, so nothing suspicious there. But then, starting from the second event, it's all about powershell.exe. Powershell can be both good and bad because it's a powerful tool often used by attackers but also legitimate for admins.\n\nLooking deeper, in the second event, the command line has some interesting parts: they're using findstr to search for 'pass' in various file types like XML, DOC, TXT, XLS. That immediately raises a red flag because searching for passwords or sensitive info could be part of data exfiltration or credential dumping. The command is trying to find strings matching 'password', which might indicate an attempt to gather credentials.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is accessing the registry (Registry value set) and loading various images, like mscoree.dll and others. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but combined with the file operations, they could be part of a larger script execution. Powershell scripts often load these modules as part of their operation.\n\nThen there's the creation and deletion of a temporary PS1 script in the user's AppData folder. The file is created and then deleted quickly. This behavior is common in malware to avoid detection or to test if script execution is allowed, which could be an indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, I see multiple events where the same command line is executed, suggesting that this script might be running several times or in different contexts. The repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks might indicate that the powershell process is being monitored or restarted, possibly to avoid detection mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: using findstr for password searches, creating and deleting a temp script, multiple registry accesses, and repeated powershell executions with suspicious command linesâ€”these are all signs of potential malicious activity. It's not definitive proof, but the combination points towards something interesting that warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious commands and file operations suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by going through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst up, there are multiple entries with the process name 'powershell.exe' and some have command lines that look suspicious. The command line in these events is using powershell.exe with some findstr and select-string commands searching for password patterns in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc. That immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for lateral movement or data exfiltration, especially when combined with commands that search for sensitive information.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these events, there's 'Process Create' and 'Image Load', which are common in malicious activities to execute scripts or load malicious libraries. Also, 'Registry value set' is another concerning task because attackers often modify registry entries to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThere's also an event where a file is created by powershell.exe in the user's AppData directory. This could be part of setting up a malicious profile or storing configuration files for later use. Additionally, there are multiple instances where 'svchost.exe' and other legitimate processes like 'Calculator.exe', 'conhost.exe', and 'chrome.exe' are involved in Registry events. While these are common system processes, the combination with other suspicious activities might indicate they're being exploited or used as part of a broader attack.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of similar command lines and tasks across different events. This repetition suggests a possible script or batch process running multiple times, which could be indicative of automated malicious behavior rather than normal user activity.\n\nI should also consider if there are any timestamps or event IDs that might show these activities happening in quick succession, but without that info, I'll focus on the types and combinations.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of PowerShell commands searching for sensitive data, combined with multiple Registry modifications and process creations, points towards potential malicious activity. The repetition and combination across different processes further support this assessment. So, classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" makes sense because there's a high likelihood of something being amiss.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including searching for sensitive data and registry modifications suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several instances where powershell.exe and cmd.exe are being used. Powershell is often a red flag because it can be used for malicious activities like executing scripts or commands. For example, seeing 'powershell.exe' multiple times with different tasks might indicate some activity worth looking into.\n\nThen I see that the user is interacting with files, creating them using winlogbeat.exe and powershell. There's a file named estrutura_ativo.txt created by powershell, which could be suspicious if it's unexpected. Also, there are several events where schtasks.exe is being used to delete scheduled tasks. This might suggest someone is trying to remove traces of their activities or disable security mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the commands run via cmd.exe and schtasks.exe, some of them look like they're deleting specific tasks. For instance, 'schtasks \/delete' suggests that the user has administrative privileges and is removing scheduled tasks which could be part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nI also notice events where svchost.exe interacts with the registry. Svchost is a legitimate process but can sometimes be used maliciously by DLL injection. The fact that it's modifying registry entries might indicate some form of persistence or configuration changes, which could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the use of whoami.exe, which is often used to check user permissions or privileges. If this is run in conjunction with other tools like powershell or cmd, it might be part of an elevation of privilege attempt or information gathering.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple instances where processes create new tasks (ProcessCreate) and access registry values. These actions alone aren't necessarily malicious but when combined with the frequency and types of processes involved, they could indicate suspicious behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and schtasks.exe for deleting tasks, along with registry modifications by svchost.exe and whoami.exe, suggests potential malicious activity. The pattern looks like someone trying to remove traces or establish persistence, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple potentially suspicious activities including the use of PowerShell and cmd.exe for task deletion, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and repeated process creations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. So, first, I'll go through each event and note down what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few logs, I see processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, WMIC.exe, and others being created or accessing certain things. For example, there's a process where WMIC.exe is used with a command to delete notepad.exe. That seems a bit suspicious because deleting processes can be part of malicious activities.\n\nThen, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing or modifying registry values. Powershell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so repeated access could indicate something fishy. Plus, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes a user account with the name \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". That looks like an attempt to remove a user account, possibly to cover tracks.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the use of net.exe and net1.exe to delete user accounts. These are legitimate commands but using them in quick succession or multiple times might be part of a script trying to clean up traces after compromising a system.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe command being executed twice. This is usually used to check permissions, so if it's run multiple times without a clear reason, it could be a sign of someone exploring user privileges.\n\nConsidering all these events together: deleting user accounts, accessing registry values with powershell and cmd, using WMIC for process deletionâ€”all these actions are common in attack chains. It seems like someone is trying to remove evidence or escalate their access on the system. The repeated use of different tools (powershell, cmd, wmic) might indicate a more sophisticated attacker who knows multiple ways to achieve their goals.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to be certain if this is actual malicious activity or just a user performing administrative tasks. But given the combination of events like account deletions and process terminations, especially using multiple methods, it does raise red flags.\n\nI'd say the confidence level is around 0.7 because while there are concerning signs, there's no direct evidence of malicious intent beyond the observed actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious processes and commands indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So I've got a bunch of Windows log events here that need analysis. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with only one classification and justification.\n\nLooking at each event, they seem to involve various processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, etc., along with different registry events and process creations. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where cmd.exe is used to delete user accounts. For example:\n- \"cmd.exe \/c net user \\\"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\\\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\"\n- Similarly, other commands like deleting \"pacote_auxiliar_Admin\" and others. These look like they're trying to remove specific admin accounts.\n\nThen there are powershell.exe instances accessing processes or modifying the registry:\n- Powershell is used multiple times with tasks like 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set'. This could be an indicator of malicious activity since PowerShell is often used for scripting and can hide malicious commands.\n  \nI also see some deletion of services via sc.exe, like \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting services might be part of a cleanup process to remove traces of malware or to prevent certain services from running.\n\nLooking at the variety of processes: cmd.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe. Using multiple tools can be a tactic to avoid detection or to perform different tasks. For example, using whoami could be checking user permissions or credentials, which is common in privilege escalation.\n\nThe combination of deleting users, modifying registry entries, and deleting services suggests someone is trying to clean up traces on the system. These activities together might indicate an attacker attempting to remove evidence after initial access or lateral movement within a network.\n\nAnother point is that some commands are executed with >nul 2>&1, which is a common way in cmd to suppress output. Attackers often do this to avoid generating too much log noise.\n\nThe fact that these events occur in a sequence and involve multiple potentially malicious actions makes the batch interesting. It's not just one-off incidents but a series of steps that together could indicate an ongoing or completed attack.\n\nI should also consider if there are any anomalies beyond the obvious. Since all these events seem related to system modifications and deletions, it's more concerning than normal user activity which typically doesn't involve deleting services or admin accounts in such a manner.\n\nHowever, without knowing the context of whether this is during an authorized maintenance or by legitimate admins, it's hard to be certain. But given the nature of the commands, especially the deletions and registry modifications, it leans towards malicious intent.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I think the batch should be classified as INTERESTING because it shows multiple potentially malicious activities that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of process creations and registry modifications, including deletions of user accounts and services. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior such as evidence removal or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the logs, I notice that most of them involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. I remember reading that attackers often use it to execute scripts or commands that are harder to trace.\n\nThe first few events show ImageLoad tasks for various DLL files. One is from Windows Defender, which seems normal since Defender might scan files. But the other one is clrjit.dll, which I'm not too familiar with. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are FileCreate and FileDeleteDetected events related to a temporary PowerShell script: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly makes me think of scripts trying to avoid detection or leaving traces. Maybe the script is doing something malicious before deleting itself.\n\nThere are also PipeCreated events, which could indicate communication between processes. If this pipe is being used by a PowerShell process, it might be part of some command execution or data transfer that's not meant to be seen easily.\n\nOne event stands out where the CommandLine for powershell.exe is \"& {}\". That seems odd because using \"&\" without any parameters usually doesn't do much in cmd, but in PowerShell, maybe it's a way to execute something else. I'm not entirely sure what this does, but it could be part of obfuscation techniques.\n\nI also see multiple RegistryEvent tasks where powershell.exe accesses or modifies the registry. This is concerning because changing system settings or persistence mechanisms often happens during an attack. The fact that these events are repeated might mean the process is trying to establish a persistent presence.\n\nLooking further, there's whoami.exe being executed multiple times. While this can be used by scripts to check permissions, it could also indicate reconnaissance activities where an attacker is verifying their privileges or checking system information.\n\nThere's another process called winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. I'm not sure if that's related to malicious activity; maybe it's part of log management, but since it's paired with a .yml configuration file, could this be setting up something malicious?\n\nPutting all these together: repeated PowerShell activities (script creation\/deletion, command line oddities, registry access), whoami.exe executions, and the temporary script. These behaviors don't look like normal user activity. They resemble tactics used in attacksâ€”like using scripts to execute commands, accessing system info for lateral movement, or setting up persistence.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because it exhibits several red flags associated with potential malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.85 because while some actions might be legitimate, the combination seems too coincidental and indicative of attack patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe, including script creation\/deletion, registry access, and repeated process creations, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe is involved in a registry value set. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, especially when accessing the registry.\n\nNext, cmd.exe runs some commands deleting files in the temp directory. The use of del command with specific filenames might be part of an attempt to remove traces or delete unwanted files. This could indicate something suspicious, like cleaning up after an attack.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event accessing a processâ€”that's concerning again. It shows that PowerShell is interacting with other processes, which can be a sign of lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThere are multiple cmd.exe entries setting registry values and deleting files. These repeated actions might be part of a script trying to maintain persistence or cover its tracks.\n\nLooking further, one cmd.exe event deletes a specific file: tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe. The filename suggests it's related to some malicious activity, possibly from a previously executed malicious file that was decoded.\n\nThen, there are several conhost.exe and whoami.exe events. Conhost is often used in command-line attacks, while whoami.exe is typically benign but can be part of reconnaissance activities.\n\nMultiple powershell.exe entries with varying tasks: creating processes, accessing registry, loading images like mscoree.dll, etc. The repeated ProcessCreate and RegistryEvent tasks are worrying because they show multiple instances of PowerShell being spawned and interacting with the system, which is a common tactic in APTs or malware.\n\nThe repetitive pattern of using cmd.exe and powershell.exe for various tasks without any legitimate context makes me think this could be part of an attack chain. The combination of deleting files, accessing registry, and launching processes like whoami might indicate information gathering or privilege escalation.\n\nI notice several events where the command line is 'powershell.exe & {}' with tasks like Provider Lifecycle. These seem like they might be part of a PowerShell activity trying to load modules or initialize components, which can sometimes be used in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nThe overall patternâ€”multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing actions that don't seem to align with normal user activitiesâ€”raises concern. It's possible this is a coordinated attack using known tools like cmd and PowerShell for execution and persistence.\n\nI'm considering the possibility of a script being executed multiple times, each time deleting files and setting registry values to ensure persistence across reboots. The repeated RegistryEvent tasks support this idea as attackers often use the registry to maintain their presence on the system.\n\nThe fact that several events involve loading different DLLs with powershell.exe could indicate an attempt to execute malicious code or inject it into other processes, which is a common technique in cyberattacks.\n\nIn summary, the combination of multiple process creations, file deletions, registry modifications, and repeated use of PowerShell and cmd without clear benign justification points towards potentially malicious activity. The confidence level is high because the pattern fits well-known attack tactics.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe performing actions indicative of potential malicious behavior, including registry modifications, file deletions, and process creations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classification as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, let me look through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **powershell.exe accessed**: PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. I'll keep an eye on how many times it appears and if there are any suspicious actions.\n2. **whoami.exe created process**: Whoami is a common utility, usually not malicious unless it's being used in a way that elevates privileges or accesses sensitive information.\n3. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Another instance of PowerShell. I should check the frequency and context.\n4. **RuntimeBroker.exe modified registry**: Runtime Broker is part of Windows' User Account Control, so registry modifications could be normal but might indicate something if they're too frequent or unexpected.\n5. **notepad.exe modified registry**: Notepad isn't typically associated with malicious activity, but any unexpected registry changes could be worth noting.\n6. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Now it's the third time. Maybe I should consider whether this is unusual for the system.\n7. **calc.exe loaded urlmon.dll**: Calculator loading a URL-related DLL might not be normal. I'll need to check if urlmon.dll is legitimate in that context.\n8. **svchost.exe modified registry**: SvcHost is a generic host process for services, so frequent registry changes could indicate something malicious.\n9. **svchost.exe again**: Another instance of the same process modifying the registry.\n10. **Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll**: Similar to point 7, another instance where Calculator is loading an unexpected DLL.\n11. **svchost.exe modified registry**: Third time svchost has made registry changes.\n12. **winlogbeat.exe created a file**: Winlogbeat is likely part of the log management system, so creating configuration files should be normal unless it's writing to unusual locations or in an unexpected way.\n13. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Fourth time PowerShell is being accessed. This might warrant further investigation if it's outside usual patterns.\n14. **whoami.exe created process**: Another whoami process. Could this be part of privilege escalation?\n15. **powershell.exe accessed again**: Fifth time. I'm starting to think there's a pattern here that could be suspicious.\n16. **ApplicationFrameHost.exe modified registry**: Application Frame Host is related to the Start menu and window management, so unexpected registry changes might not be standard.\n17. **Calculator.exe modified registry**: Now Calculator is also making registry changes. That seems unusual.\n18. **chrome.exe made DNS queries**: Chrome doing DNS lookups is normal, especially if it's navigating to websites.\n19. **Another chrome.exe DNS query**: Multiple lookups could be part of browsing activity.\n20. **More chrome.exe DNS queries**: Again, likely part of normal browsing unless the domains are malicious.\n21. **chrome.exe made network connection**: Network connections from Chrome are expected for web traffic.\n22. **Multiple instances of chrome.exe making network connections**: Could indicate multiple tabs or extensions active.\n\nNow, considering all these events together:\n\n- The batch includes several instances where non-standard actions occur. For example, multiple processes (powershell.exe, whoami.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, Calculator.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe) modifying the registry could be a red flag for potential malicious activity aiming to alter system configurations.\n- The repeated access of powershell.exe is concerning because it's often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. Five instances in the log might indicate an active session or script running PowerShell multiple times.\n- The loading of urlmon.dll by Calculator.exe seems out of place. URLMON is related to handling URLs, so this could be indicative of a malicious payload trying to establish communication channels or inject code.\n- SvcHost.exe modifying the registry three times stands out because it's a process that shouldn't typically make such changes frequently unless part of a service installation, which would usually be done during startup rather than multiple times in quick succession.\n\nPutting this together, there are several points of concern:\n\n1. **Frequent Registry Modifications**: Multiple processes making registry changes could indicate an attempt to persistence or alter system behavior maliciously.\n2. **Abnormal DLL Loadings**: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll is unusual and might suggest a malicious process injection or a dropped file executing from an unexpected location.\n3. **Repeated PowerShell Access**: Five instances of powershell.exe being accessed within the log window could indicate someone using it for scripting, which in some contexts might be normal (e.g., system admins), but without additional context, it's hard to say. However, given the other points, it adds to the suspicion.\n4. **Elevated Privilege Tools**: Use of whoami.exe and powershell.exe together could hint at privilege escalation techniques or information gathering.\n\nI'm also considering if these events are within a short time frame. If they occurred over a few minutes, that might suggest coordinated activity, which would be more concerning than spread out events.\n\nPotential justifications for \"INTERESTING\" classification:\n\n- Multiple registry modifications by different processes could indicate malicious behavior.\n- Abnormal file loads and process creations might signal an attack.\n- The combination of these activities points towards potential unauthorized access or system compromise.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider if these actions could be legitimate. For example, maybe a user is running PowerShell scripts for administrative tasks, whoami.exe is being used by an admin tool, and the registry modifications are part of some software installation process. Notably, notepad.exe modifying the registry might be unusual but could happen in certain scenarios.\n\nBut given that there are multiple such events across different processes and some of them (like urlmon.dll loading) are more concerning, it's leaning towards \"INTERESTING\".\n\nThe confidence is high because while each event on its own might not be definitive, together they form a pattern that suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because without additional context (like timestamps, exact commands run in PowerShell, or the content of registry changes), it's possible these could be legitimate actions. However, given the volume and nature, I'm fairly confident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes accessed unusual resources, including suspicious DLL loads and repeated PowerShell access, suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
