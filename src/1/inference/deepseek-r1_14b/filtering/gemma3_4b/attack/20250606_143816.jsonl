First, I notice that all the events are from PowerShell executions. That's a red flag because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement.\n\nLooking closer, most events have the same command line: they're downloading code from a GitHub repository using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()`. This is a common technique to execute arbitrary scripts, which could indicate malicious activity. The script in question is `WinPwn.ps1`, known for potentially harmful actions like data exfiltration or system compromise.\n\nAnother point of interest is the repeated use of `New-PSDrive` with parameters that suggest attempts to access remote drives (like `\\\\Target\\\\C$`). This could be an attempt to gain access to other systems on the network, which is a classic sign of lateral movement in attacks.\n\nThe tasks logged are either 'Registry value set' or various 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events. The registry modification might allow persistence for the malicious script, ensuring it runs again after a system restart.\n\nConsidering all these together—multiple instances of downloading and executing scripts from a known repository, repeated attempts to access remote drives, and registry modifications—it's clear that this batch shows signs of potential malicious activity. The consistency in commands suggests a concerted effort rather than isolated incidents, making the entire batch highly relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts downloaded from a GitHub repository, along with attempts to access remote drives and registry modifications, indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate JSON object. Each event has 'process', 'winlog', and 'file' fields. \n\nLooking at the first few events, I see processes like sppsvc.exe loading taskschd.dll and creating cache files. That's normal Windows stuff—probably part of system updates or service management. No red flags there.\n\nThen, whoami.exe is run. It's a common tool for checking user info, so unless it's used in an unusual way here, it's not concerning. The command line seems straightforward.\n\nThe majority of the events involve powershell.exe. Let me look closer:\n\n- Powershell starts (Process Create).\n- There are ImageLoad events for various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. These are legitimate .NET framework components.\n- A FileCreate event for a temporary script file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1), which is then deleted shortly after with a FileDeleteDetected event.\n\nWait, creating and deleting a temp script file could be part of testing script execution policies. But the fact that it's done via powershell might raise an eyebrow. Also, the command line for one of the process creations includes a PSDrive to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks like an attempt to access another system or share.\n\nPutting this together: creating a temp script, accessing a remote drive (if \"Target\" is a network path), and deleting the script afterward might be signs of lateral movement or persistence. The repeated use of powershell with such activities could indicate malicious behavior, especially if the script was meant to execute commands on another machine.\n\nHowever, without seeing the content of the script, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. But the combination of creating a temp script, accessing a remote path, and deleting it suggests potential exploitation or exfiltration attempts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion and network drive access, which may indicate malicious behavior such as lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of system log events is interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a process named powershell.exe being executed without any command line arguments. Then, another event shows whoami.exe being run, which seems normal because it's just checking the user information. But then I see more powershell.exe processes with some command lines that look suspicious.\n\nLooking at one of the powershell.exe events, the command line has a Base64 encoded string or something like that. It tries to download a script from GitHub using iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(). That's a red flag because downloading scripts can be a sign of malicious activity. The script is from raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn, which I think might be known for malicious purposes.\n\nNext, there are several ImageLoad events in powershell.exe, loading various DLL files. That's normal for PowerShell as it uses .NET libraries, but the combination with downloading a script makes me cautious.\n\nThen, there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_0wo2rwkr.dxh.ps1. Creating and deleting a file quickly could be an attempt to avoid detection or persistence. It seems like the script was downloaded, executed, and then cleaned up, which is common in malware behavior.\n\nThere are also multiple Registry value set events for both powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Modifying registry values can allow attackers to maintain persistence or change system configurations maliciously.\n\nLooking at the sequence, it starts with normal processes but escalates with PowerShell downloading a script from a suspicious domain, executing it, creating temporary files, and modifying the registry. The repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nSo combining all these events: suspicious command-line arguments in PowerShell, file creation\/deletion in Temp,registry modifications, and DLL loading for a script download—this definitely looks like malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including PowerShell downloading a script from a potentially malicious source, executing it, creating temporary files, and modifying the registry. These actions suggest possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. The first thing that catches my eye is the command line from the process event: \"powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}\". This looks like a PowerShell command being executed, which immediately raises some red flags because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nBreaking down that command, New-PSDrive is used to create a new PowerShell drive. The parameters here are setting the name to 'g' and specifying the filesystem provider. The interesting part is \"-unidade_auxiliar\", but I think that might be a typo or perhaps in another language—maybe it's supposed to be something like \"-root\" or similar. Regardless, the key point is that it's trying to map a drive to \"\\\\Target\\\\C$\", which suggests an attempt to access a remote system (assuming \"Target\" is another machine) over the network.\n\nNow, looking at the rest of the events in the batch, there are multiple entries where the task in winlog is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This repetition makes me think that this isn't just a single event but part of a larger sequence or perhaps an automated process. The fact that each subsequent event after the first one doesn't have a process or file entry might indicate that these are follow-up commands or perhaps part of a loop, which is common in scripts.\n\nPutting it all together, the initial PowerShell command attempts to establish a remote connection, and then there's a series of events where remote commands are being executed. This pattern is concerning because executing multiple remote commands without clear justification could be indicative of unauthorized access or malicious activity. The fact that this is happening across multiple log entries suggests persistence, which is a tactic often used by attackers to maintain control over a system.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of it being a legitimate administrative task, but the combination of PowerShell and repeated remote command executions makes it more likely than not to be suspicious. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe without proper justification in logs is a common red flag because attackers often use it to execute malicious scripts that aren't easily detectable by standard security measures.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the activities described exhibit behavior consistent with potential malicious actions. The confidence level is high because the pattern of events—starting with a PowerShell command attempting remote access and followed by numerous remote command executions—is not typical of normal user activity and aligns with known attack vectors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes a PowerShell command attempting to create a drive mapping to a remote system, followed by multiple events indicating the execution of remote commands. This combination suggests potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
