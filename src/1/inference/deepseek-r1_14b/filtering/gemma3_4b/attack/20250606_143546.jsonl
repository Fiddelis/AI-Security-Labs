{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm seeing a lot of entries here, so I need to analyze them as a whole.\n\nFirst off, most of the events involve svchost.exe. That's a common system process, so it's not inherently suspicious. But I notice a lot of Registry value sets and file creations.\n\nLooking at the tasks: many are 'RegistryEvent' where values are being set. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate operations, especially for services like svchost.exe which often manage various system components. However, too many registry changes might raise an eyebrow, but in this case, there's a pattern rather than something unusual.\n\nThen, there are file creation events. The files created include log files and data store entries, which seems normal for system operations. One path stands out: 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\SoftwareDistribution\\\\Download\\\\3d2d4f109832e8e4a9776db11ac71c44' and its subfile. SoftwareDistribution is typically related to Windows Update, so downloads here are expected.\n\nBut wait, one event has a null process name. That's unusual because most events have svchost.exe. A null process might indicate something else or an error, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nOverall, the majority of activities seem routine for system processes handling logs and updates. The repetition might be part of a legitimate background process rather than anything nefarious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal system processes like svchost.exe making registry changes and creating log files, which are typical for system operations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice a lot of them involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in malicious activities due to its scripting capabilities. For example, the 5th event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line that includes importing a .ps1 script from a specific path. The script seems to have some obfuscation or unusual naming: \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\". I'm not sure what's in there, but it could be malicious.\n\nAlso, the same process creates and then deletes a file in the Temp directory (__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1). Creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection. This activity looks suspicious because legitimate scripts usually don't delete themselves that way.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe, loading various DLLs. While some of these are normal .NET framework components, others like MpOAV.dll or MpClient.dll relate to Windows Defender, which might indicate an attempt to disable or manipulate antivirus behavior. This could be part of a larger attack strategy.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process accessed event and a registry value set by powershell.exe. Registry modifications can be dangerous if they're changing system configurations to allow persistence or elevate privileges. The svchost.exe events also show file creation in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which is used for Windows updates. Malware sometimes targets this area to hide their files.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities—executing scripts with potential malicious commands, quick file creation\/deletion, DLL loading related to security components, and registry modifications—indicate possible malicious behavior. This batch of events seems to show a pattern that could be part of an attack chain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell executions with suspicious activities including script execution from untrusted paths, file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, and registry modifications.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, I see that svchost.exe is involved in registry value sets and file creations. Svchost.exe is a common system process, often associated with services, so these activities aren't unusual on their own. They could be part of normal system operations or updates.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries from MpSigStub.exe. This is related to Windows Defender, as it's responsible for signature updates. The events show file creations in the Temp directory with specific filenames like mpasdlta.vdm._p and mpavdlta.vdm._p. These seem consistent with how antivirus software handles update files, so this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThen there are several entries from setup.exe under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore. The files being created include things like cookie_exporter.exe and identity_helper.exe. Since Edge is a legitimate application, these activities could be part of its installation or update process. Setup.exe is commonly used during installations, so this seems normal unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\nThere's also an event from MsMpEng.exe loading mpengine.dll, which again ties back to Windows Defender operations. No issues here.\n\nAnother process mentioned is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value and powershell.exe being accessed. RuntimeBroker is related to UWP app containerization, so registry writes are expected. Powershell access could be benign or malicious, but without more context on the command run, it's hard to say. However, in this batch, there's no indication of suspicious activity with Powershell.\n\nPutting it all together, most activities here relate to legitimate system processes like Windows Defender updates, Edge setup, and normal service operations. While I can't rule out any possibility entirely, there doesn't seem to be any overtly malicious behavior indicated by these logs. The events don't show signs of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or known attack patterns.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole isn't particularly interesting for further investigation since it appears to consist mostly of normal system operations and legitimate software activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes such as Windows Defender updates, Edge setup operations, and normal service activities.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. I'm looking at a batch of events and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any anomalies or patterns that might indicate malicious activity.\n\n1. **RuntimeBroker.exe** setting registry values: Runtime Broker is typically related to user profiles and UWP app containerization. Registry writes are common here, so this isn't unusual.\n   \n2. **HxTsr.exe** also sets a registry value. HxTsr is usually associated with anti-virus or system protection tools; legitimate activities might include registry changes.\n\n3. **svchost.exe** setting a registry value: svchost is a common host process for services, and many legitimate services use it. Registry writes here aren't inherently suspicious unless they're in known malicious areas.\n\n4. **sppsvc.exe** creating a file at cache.dat: SPPsvc is related to Software Protection Services, managing product activation. Creating a cache file isn't unusual; however, the exact path seems normal but could be worth checking for unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **powershell.exe** creating a profile data file in the user's AppData directory: PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but legitimate scripts also use it. The presence of a StartupProfileData file isn't suspicious on its own unless executed in an unusual context.\n\n6. **powershell.exe** setting a registry value again: This aligns with step 5; it's part of the same process's activities and is still within normal operations for PowerShell.\n\n7. Another **svchost.exe** setting a registry value: As before, common behavior unless in known malicious areas.\n\n8. **svchost.exe** loading urlmon.dll: URLMon is a standard Windows DLL used for handling URLs and URIs, often loaded by various processes. This isn't a red flag.\n\n9. **RuntimeBroker.exe** loading the same urlmon.dll: Again, standard behavior, especially in system processes.\n\n10. Multiple instances of **svchost.exe** creating files under the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory with various .dll extensions: These paths are related to Windows Update and servicing stack operations. svchost is known to handle such tasks during updates or patches. The filenames like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll, etc., are all legitimate components used in update processes.\n\n11. **backgroundTaskHost.exe** loading urlmon.dll: Background task hosts are part of the system's background services; this activity is normal.\n\n12. **msedgewebview2.exe** and **svchost.exe** loading BitsProxy.dll: These are related to background file transfers, often seen in update or download processes, which are legitimate.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be a mix of standard system operations. svchost.exe is involved in several activities, but its role as a service host means many actions are expected. PowerShell's use here isn't concerning without additional context. The creation of files and registry changes don't point to malicious behavior when considering the process names and file paths.\n\nThere's no evidence of unusual processes, unexpected file accesses, or known malicious file hashes in the logs provided. All activities align with typical Windows system operations, including those related to updates, service management, and legitimate software components.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as svchost.exe performing registry writes and file creations related to update metadata, along with PowerShell executing legitimate tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a process named \"whoami.exe\" being created. That seems normal as it's often used to get user information, but I should keep an eye out for how it's used in context.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could be a red flag. The command line in one of the events has something suspicious: it's creating a new service with the name \"objeto_ativo\" (which translates to \"active object\") and setting its binary path to a specific .exe file. That seems unusual because it involves creating a new service, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe accesses processes, registry values, and loads several images, including .NET framework components. While these are normal for Powershell execution, the combination with other actions might indicate something malicious.\n\nThere's also an attempt to create a file in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\". This temporary script is suspicious because it tries to test script policy and then deletes itself. Such behavior is often seen in attacks to bypass certain security policies or execute malicious scripts without being detected for long.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry value sets from services.exe. While services can legitimately modify the registry, multiple writes could be part of creating or modifying a service, which aligns with the earlier powershell activity. This could indicate an attempt to create a persistent backdoor.\n\nPutting it all together: whoami.exe is run, then powershell.exe executes commands that set up a new service and delete temporary files after creating them. The creation of a service suggests persistence, while the deleted script hints at an attack attempting to stay undetected. The multiple registry modifications by services.exe support this as potential indicators of compromise.\n\nTherefore, this batch shows signs of malicious activity, making it interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activities including service creation, file operations in Temp directory, and multiple registry modifications, indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given several JSONL entries, each representing an event with a process, Windows log task, and file information.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that they all have similar command lines in the process field. They're using PowerShell to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to a binary path on C:\\unidade_logico\\... and then starting that service. This seems suspicious because creating services can be a tactic for persistence or privilege escalation, especially if done via PowerShell.\n\nBut wait, the task in the winlog is 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle', which I think are normal Windows events during service creation or management. So maybe this isn't overtly malicious yet? It could just be legitimate system administration, but it's still something to watch because creating a new service can hide malicious binaries.\n\nThen there's another set of events where the process is None, and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. The file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script name sounds generic, but executing remote commands could be risky if not authorized. Also, there are multiple events of this type, which might indicate repeated attempts or part of a larger script execution.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a combination of service creation via PowerShell and remote command executions. While individually these actions can be legitimate, the repetition (13 times for each) raises flags. It suggests automated or batch processing, possibly indicating an attempt to deploy malicious services across multiple systems or as part of a larger attack chain.\n\nI'm concerned because creating services with specific names like \"objeto_ativo\" and the file paths leading into 'registro_comum' and 'registro_secundario' might be following a certain pattern that could be linked to known malware behaviors. The use of PowerShell is common in attacks, so this adds another layer of concern.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say definitively if these are malicious. But the combination of multiple events with similar patterns and the nature of the commands makes me lean towards classifying this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell command execution creating a service and executing remote commands, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. Each event is in JSONL format, with three main fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I notice that many of them have \"winlog\" tasks labeled as \"Execute a Remote Command\" and \"Special Logon\". These seem significant because executing remote commands can be a red flag for potential malicious activity. The fact that this task appears multiple times in the logs suggests repeated attempts or executions.\n\nThe file path mentioned is consistent across several events: \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1\". PowerShell scripts are commonly used in attacks because they can execute commands and have persistence mechanisms. The repetition of accessing the same script file raises suspicion as it could indicate a script being run multiple times, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where \"services.exe\" logs a \"Logon\" event. While services.exe is a legitimate system process, unexpected logon activities from this service might warrant investigation. The combination of these logon events with the repeated remote command executions could indicate an attack vector or unauthorized access.\n\nThe presence of both \"Execute a Remote Command\" and file accesses to a .ps1 script points towards potential script execution via remote commands. This pattern is often seen in APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) or other malicious activities where scripts are used for payload delivery or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering all these factors together—the repeated remote command executions, the specific file access patterns, and the involvement of services.exe—it's reasonable to classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\". There's a strong indication of possible malicious behavior that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show repeated attempts to execute remote commands via a specific PowerShell script, which may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line seems to represent an event with some process information, windows log details, and file paths.\n\nStarting off, the first few events show processes named 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various .NET framework files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That looks pretty standard for a .NET application. I don't see any red flags there immediately—those are common system files being loaded by a process.\n\nThen, looking further down, I notice events involving 'powershell.exe'. There's one event where PowerShell is creating a file in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. Creating profile data isn't unusual, but it's worth keeping an eye on because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities.\n\nAnother event shows that 'powershell.exe' set a registry value. That caught my attention because modifying the registry is something that could be part of persistence mechanisms in malware. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious or just standard configuration changes.\n\nThen there are events where the process field is None, but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path points to 'componente_auxiliar.ps1'. This makes me think that PowerShell is executing some remote command. The script paths here seem a bit odd—'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1'. These paths don't look like standard system directories, so they might be user-created or part of an application's custom folder structure.\n\nLooking closer at the command line in some events, I see that powershell.exe is being called with a script that imports a module from 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\Componente_auxiliar.ps1' and then tries to invoke a function 'Invoke-entrada_principal'. The use of custom scripts and functions named in Portuguese ('entrada principal') makes me wonder if this is related to some specific application or possibly obfuscation.\n\nI also notice that the script includes error handling with try-catch blocks and sleeps for 5 seconds. This could be part of a script designed to run periodically or wait before executing, which can sometimes be indicative of malicious behavior trying to avoid detection or stagger actions.\n\nThe events mention tasks like 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which are typical PowerShell events as it initializes and manages its environment. However, combined with the custom scripts and remote execution, this could be a sign that something is being executed in a more controlled manner, possibly to evade monitoring tools.\n\nPutting this all together: we have multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a script from non-standard paths, involving file creation, registry changes, and error handling. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination—especially the repeated execution of the same script and the nature of the tasks performed—is concerning. It raises the possibility that this could be part of malicious activity, such as installing malware components or establishing persistence.\n\nI'm also considering if these actions are legitimate. Could it be a custom application using PowerShell for scripting? Maybe, but given the paths and some indicators like 'registro_secundario' which translates to 'secondary registration', it sounds more like an attempt to log or record something, possibly malicious in nature.\n\nAnother angle is that these could be part of a script testing phase by a developer, but the combination of remote execution, registry changes, and non-standard file paths makes me lean towards it being potentially harmful. Additionally, seeing multiple events from the same script with similar command lines suggests repeated attempts or loops, which is common in malicious scripts trying to achieve persistence or distribute further actions.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think there's a reasonable chance that this batch of events could indicate malicious activity. While not conclusive on its own, the pattern and specific indicators point towards something that might merit closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances executing a script from non-standard paths, including registry modifications and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and my task is to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation by classifying it as either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLooking at the events, I notice that most of them have similar entries. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. However, for some events like the first one, process is \"None\" while winlog indicates a task being \"Execute a Remote Command\" and points to a specific PowerShell script path.\n\nI see that many events repeat the same information, which might indicate something suspicious or just normal repeated activity. The file paths in these events point to 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1', which seems like an unusual filename and path structure. PowerShell scripts are often used for legitimate tasks but can also be vectors for malicious activities.\n\nThere's also one event where the task is \"Windows Update Agent\", which is more normal, as Windows Update is a standard process. But it still has \"None\" for both process and file, so less concerning than the remote command executions.\n\nThe repetition of the same 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks with the same file path makes me think this could be part of a script execution or scheduled task, which might be legitimate but could also be an indicator of unauthorized access. Alternatively, it could be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain control over a system.\n\nSince all these events are identical and repeated multiple times, it's possible that the system is experiencing unusual behavior. The high number of similar events could indicate a potential attack, such as mass exploitation or an attempt to execute malicious scripts repeatedly.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm not entirely sure if this is just normal operation, but given the repetitive nature and the specific file path, it leans towards something that might warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events indicate potential malicious activity or unusual system behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
