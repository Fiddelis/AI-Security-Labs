{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several events from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal because browsers do connect to the internet regularly. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nThen I see a process named MpDefenderCoreService.exe which is part of Windows Defender. It's monitoring network connections, so that's expected and not concerning.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this catches my attention. But I need to see the context. Are these normal admin tasks or something else?\n\nNext, I notice cmd.exe being used with commands like \"dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key\" and searching for \".key\" files. This might indicate someone is looking for sensitive files, possibly configuration keys. That's a bit worrying because it could be part of an attack to find credentials.\n\nThere are also entries from whoami.exe and conhost.exe. Whoami is often used to check user permissions, which can be part of reconnaissance. Conhost.exe is usually related to remote sessions; if used in combination with other tools, it might indicate a remote access attempt.\n\nAdditionally, I see file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely an agent collecting logs, so that's normal. However, the file named tarefa_geral.txt created by PowerShell isn't clear—it could be part of data exfiltration or just a script output.\n\nThe repeated registry value sets across different processes (cmd.exe, conhost.exe) are concerning because attackers often modify the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or hide their activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of process creations, network connections, file operations, and registry modifications with tools like PowerShell and cmd. These behaviors could indicate someone trying to gather information, possibly for malicious purposes. However, without more context on timestamps or frequency, it's hard to be certain if these are genuine admin activities or something more nefarious.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of actions—using tools like PowerShell and cmd with commands that search for sensitive files and modify system settings—is a red flag. The confidence isn't super high without additional data, but there's enough to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, cmd.exe searching for .key files, and other potentially malicious activities indicative of a potential attack.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are two events from winlogbeat.exe where a file is created. That seems normal since winlogbeat is likely just setting up its configuration files. Nothing malicious there.\n\nNext, RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. I know that Runtime Broker is related to User Account Control (UAC) and it's part of Windows' legitimate processes. So this activity is expected and not suspicious.\n\nNotepad.exe also sets a registry value. Notepad is a common tool used by users, so unless there's something unusual about the registry key being accessed, I don't see a red flag here.\n\nPowershell.exe shows up twice: once accessing a process and another setting a registry value. While PowerShell can be misused for malicious activities, in this case, it seems to be doing standard operations like accessing processes or modifying the registry. No obvious signs of misuse here.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal because that's part of Windows system files. Calculator isn't typically involved in malicious activities unless there's something specific about how it's being used, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nThere are multiple events from svchost.exe modifying registry values. SvcHost is a common host process for services, and many legitimate processes run under its name. These events alone don't indicate anything suspicious.\n\nThe ApplicationFrameHost.exe event setting a registry value is also normal as it's related to Windows shell and application hosting.\n\nAnother powershell.exe event sets a registry value, but again, without more context, this doesn't raise flags.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events: several are setting registry values. Chrome often interacts with the registry for settings and extensions. There are also image load events for legitimate system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender features. These activities align with normal browser operations and aren't concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of these events are related to standard system processes performing normal tasks. While some process names can be associated with potential malicious activities (like powershell.exe), the specific actions taken here don't exhibit signs of suspicious behavior. There's no indication of unauthorized access, file creation in unusual locations, or other red flags typical of malware.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation as there's nothing out of the ordinary that stands out.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes performing standard operations such as file creation, registry modifications, and loading legitimate system files. There are no indicators of malicious or suspicious activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I've got a batch of three log events in JSONL format. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event has process name 'powershell.exe' and the task is 'Process accessed'. That catches my attention because PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. It's a common tool for attackers, so any access might need closer inspection.\n\nThe second event is 'whoami.exe' being executed with the command line pointing to its location in system32. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which seems benign on its own. However, if it's part of a larger sequence, it could be an indicator of something else, like privilege escalation or reconnaissance.\n\nThe third event again shows 'powershell.exe' being accessed. Having two events related to PowerShell in the batch makes me think there might be more going on. Maybe someone is trying to run multiple commands or scripts through PowerShell.\n\nNow, considering all three together: the batch starts with a process access for PowerShell, then runs whoami, and then accesses PowerShell again. This sequence could indicate an attacker using PowerShell for command execution after gathering system info with whoami. It's possible that this combination is part of an attack chain, like initial access followed by information gathering and then executing malicious commands.\n\nHowever, I'm not certain if this is definitely malicious or just a user running some scripts. There's no direct evidence of malicious code in the logs—just process accesses and creations. Still, the repeated use of PowerShell raises flags because it's commonly used in attacks.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because of the combination of events involving potentially malicious tools. But my confidence isn't 100% since there's no explicit indication of harmful activity beyond tool usage.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple accesses to PowerShell.exe and execution of whoami.exe, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as information gathering or command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
