Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome does need to connect to the internet for browsing and resolve domain names. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, I notice whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows tool used to display user information. It's often used benignly, but sometimes malicious actors might use it to gather system info. However, since it's just running on its own without any other indicators of compromise, I'm not too concerned yet.\n\nNext, there are several powershell.exe entries with tasks like ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate administration tasks and by attackers for command-and-control or executing malicious scripts. The fact that there are multiple accesses and registry modifications could be a red flag, but without seeing specific malicious commands, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking further, cmd.exe is being used with commands like 'dir c:\\ \/b \/s .key' followed by findstr looking for .key files. This might indicate someone searching for keys or sensitive information. The use of cmd and findstr in this way could be part of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities.\n\nAlso, there's a process where conhost.exe is modifying the registry. Conhost is often used in Windows to host console windows for other processes, but it can sometimes be involved in malicious activity, especially when combined with registry changes that might persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management, so its file creation doesn't seem suspicious on its own. However, powershell.exe creating a file named 'tarefa_geral.txt' might be storing some output or configuration, which could be related to malicious activities if the content is not legitimate.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of powershell and cmd with potentially malicious commands (like searching for .key files) stands out. Additionally, the combination of process creations, registry modifications, and file writes by various executables raises concerns about possible unauthorized access or data theft.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while some activities are normal, others could indicate malicious behavior when considered collectively. The confidence isn't too high (maybe around 0.6) because there's no concrete evidence of an attack, just several red flags that together might warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including potentially malicious use of PowerShell and cmd.exe commands, registry modifications, and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a task to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My job is to look at all these events together and decide whether the entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING.\" I'll also need to provide a justification and a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n\nLooking at the events provided:\n\nFirst event:\n- Process: powershell.exe\n- Winlog task: Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\n- File: None\n\nSecond event:\n- Process: whoami.exe, command line pointing to C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\n- Winlog task: Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)\n- File: None\n\nThird event:\n- Same as the first one: powershell.exe accessed.\n\nSo, I need to analyze these together. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nPowershell.exe is a common tool that can be used for both legitimate and malicious activities. It's often targeted by attackers because of its powerful scripting capabilities. The \"ProcessAccess\" event suggests that another process accessed powershell.exe. This could mean anything from a legitimate script running to potential unauthorized access or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe second event is the creation of whoami.exe, which is a standard Windows utility used to display user information. However, seeing it being executed might be concerning if there's no clear reason why it was run, especially after powershell.exe was accessed.\n\nNow, considering that these are just three events, I need to think about whether this combination raises any red flags. The use of both powershell.exe and whoami.exe together could be part of an attacker's process. For example, an attacker might use powershell.exe to execute commands, possibly including querying user information with whoami.exe as part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nBut wait, the justification for classification should be concise. So, I need to determine if this batch is interesting enough based on potential malicious activities indicated by these logs.\n\nOn one hand, each event individually might not be too alarming. Processes like powershell and whoami being run could be part of normal operations, especially in environments where scripts or automated tools are commonly used.\n\nHowever, the combination of accessing powershell.exe twice and then running whoami.exe might suggest some level of suspicion. Attackers often use such a sequence to gather information about the system (using whoami) after initial access (using powershell for execution).\n\nThe confidence score should reflect how certain I am that this batch is indicative of malicious activity. Since there are only three events and without more context, it's not definitive proof of an attack but does raise some flags.\n\nI'd say the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the combination could hint at potential malicious behavior, but with a lower confidence score since each event alone isn't highly suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes events involving powershell.exe access and whoami.exe execution, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as command execution or information gathering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_175855.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first event is from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file. Winlogbeat is likely an agent that logs system activities, so this seems normal—it’s just writing its configuration file.\n\nNext, there are several events involving `notepad.exe`, `RuntimeBroker.exe`, and `svchost.exe` setting registry values. Notepad is a common application, and Runtime Broker handles user runtime permissions, which is standard. Svchost is a generic host process for services, so these activities don't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nThen there's `powershell.exe` accessing a process. PowerShell is often used by attackers because of its scripting capabilities, but not every access event is malicious. It depends on what it's doing. Since the task here is \"ProcessAccess,\" without more context, I can’t be certain if this is suspicious.\n\nA few events involve `calc.exe` and `Calculator.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`. That seems odd because Calculator shouldn't be accessing URLs or files in System32 related to URL handling. This could be a red flag indicating potentially malicious activity or a misbehaving legitimate process.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of `svchost.exe` setting registry values and `chrome.exe` doing similar actions, including loading some DLLs. Chrome is a common browser, so its processes are frequent and usually benign unless it's interacting with unexpected files or registry keys.\n\nI notice that many events involve registry modifications and image loads by various processes. While these can be part of normal operations, an unusually high number might indicate something suspicious, especially if multiple services or processes are modifying the registry around the same time.\n\nThe repeated `Registry value set` tasks for `chrome.exe`, up to nine times, is notable but not necessarily malicious unless it's doing so in a way that's inconsistent with its usual behavior. Similarly, the repeated file writes by `winlogbeat.exe` could be part of its configuration process or data collection.\n\nHowever, the key point here is the involvement of `powershell.exe` and `Calculator.exe` accessing unexpected files. PowerShell is a high-risk tool for attackers because it can execute scripts and commands that have elevated privileges. When combined with other activities like file creation or registry modifications, this could be part of a malicious payload deployment.\n\nThe multiple `Registry value set` events across different processes might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations, which could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. Additionally, the `calc.exe` process loading URL-related DLLs is concerning because it's unexpected behavior for a calculator application.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, while individually many of these actions are normal, the combination—especially involving potentially malicious processes like PowerShell and unusual file access by Calculator—raises the suspicion that this batch of logs might be indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple RegistryEvent tasks across various processes, including powershell.exe and chrome.exe, which may indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized system modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
