Let's go through each event one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of the entries are from powershell.exe. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks, but it's also commonly abused in attacks. So the fact that there are multiple instances of powershell.exe is a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events, some of them show that powershell.exe is loading various image files like clrjit.dll and mscoree.dll. These might be normal for Powershell, especially since they're part of .NET framework components. But I should also consider if these are being loaded in an unusual way or too frequently.\n\nThere's one event where whoami.exe was executed. That seems a bit concerning because it's often used to gather information about the system or user privileges. If this is running without a clear purpose, it could be part of reconnaissance for an attack.\n\nAnother significant point is the command line in one of the events:\n\"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command  $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\\\inf\\\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;\"\nThis script is looking for specific patterns in INF files. The use of ExecutionPolicy Restricted might indicate that the user is trying to run scripts with certain restrictions, which can sometimes be a way to avoid detection or execute malicious commands.\n\nThe creation of files like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1\" under C:\\Windows\\Temp suggests that Powershell is creating temporary script files. This could be part of normal operations, but it's worth investigating why such a file is being created and if it's related to any malicious activity.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances performing various actions, including checking for specific patterns in system files, loading potentially suspicious DLLs, and creating temporary script files. These activities could be indicative of malicious behavior trying to hide or escalate privileges.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with potential indicators of malicious activity, including restricted execution policies and file creation in the Temp directory.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line representing an event. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The goal is to analyze all these together rather than individually.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. **Event 1:** Process is cmd.exe with a command line that includes Dism commands to disable Windows Defender features and remove them without restarting. This looks suspicious because disabling defender can lower system security. Also, the command-line arguments suggest a user is trying to remove or modify system components.\n\n2. **Event 2:** Powershell.exe is accessed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this raises an eyebrow, especially when combined with other events.\n\n3. **Event 3:** Dism.exe is created. Dism is a legitimate tool for managing Windows features, but the command-line arguments here are similar to those in Event 1—disabling defender features and removing them without restarting. This repetition makes me think someone is running this multiple times or maybe part of a larger script.\n\nNext, I see several events where Dism.exe accesses various files in a temporary directory. The paths like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp...\" with filenames like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc., seem to be related to Windows component servicing. These are legitimate system files, but the fact that they're being accessed or modified by Dism.exe in this context could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the log tasks: there are 'Process Create', 'File Executable Detected', and 'File Created' events. The FileExecutableDetected for multiple DLLs in a temp directory suggests that these files might be executed, which could be part of legitimate operations or malicious activities like dropping malware components.\n\nThe repetition is notable—multiple instances where Dism.exe creates processes and accesses various DLLs. This kind of repetitive behavior isn't typical user activity; it seems more automated, possibly script-driven.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial command to disable defender using cmd and powershell, followed by multiple Dism operations accessing temp files, suggests a potential attempt to lower system defenses or deploy malicious software. The combination of legitimate tools (cmd, powershell, dism) being used in ways that bypass normal security checks (like not requiring restarts) could indicate an attack.\n\nSo, while each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the sequence and repetition raise red flags about potential unauthorized access or system tampering. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"EventType\": \"Security\",\n  \"Summary\": \"Potential Unauthorized System Configuration Changes Detected\",\n  \"Description\": \"Multiple events indicate attempts to disable Windows Defender features using cmd.exe and powershell.exe, followed by Dism.exe operations accessing temporary files.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to analyze a batch of system log events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. They provided 15 JSONL entries, each with process, winlog, and file details.\n\nFirst, I notice that every event has the same process name: Dism.exe. That's suspicious because it's associated with Windows deployment services, often used in enterprise environments for image management. But Dism isn't typically something a user would run on their own; it's more admin or system-level stuff.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, each entry mentions \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. That sounds like an antivirus or Windows Defender alert indicating that an executable file was detected, possibly malicious. But I need to think about what's normal here.\n\nThe files being logged are all DLLs with .mui extensions in a temporary directory. MUI stands for Multilingual User Interface, so these are probably language packs or components used by applications for localization. The paths look like temporary locations where files are extracted during installation or updates.\n\nNow, why would Dism.exe be involved in extracting these files? Dism is often used to install or update system images, so it's normal for it to handle such files during deployment processes. Since all the events are similar and follow a pattern, it suggests a legitimate operation rather than malicious activity.\n\nI should consider the confidence level. While each event on its own might raise an eyebrow, together they show a consistent process that aligns with Dism's usual operations. There’s no variation in the file paths or names that would indicate something off. So, the batch as a whole doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it's likely part of normal system operations, specifically related to language package extraction during an imaging process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show consistent activity from Dism.exe detecting multiple files in a temporary directory.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each event has three components: process info showing it's Dism.exe, a Windows log indicating that an executable file was detected, and the file path.\n\nFirst off, Dism.exe is known as the Deployment Imaging Service and Management tool in Windows. It's typically used for servicing Windows images, like adding or removing features. So seeing this process running isn't unusual on its own.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various DLLs, including .mui files which I know are usually language resource files. The naming conventions like SysprepProvider.dll.mui and others suggest these are part of Windows servicing or setup packages.\n\nThe fact that Dism.exe is triggering file executable detections for all these files makes me think it's processing these as part of its normal operations, extracting or deploying them. Since they're in a temporary directory and the filenames don't raise any red flags, this seems like legitimate activity.\n\nI don't see anything indicating malicious behavior here—no signs of unauthorized access, encryption, or known malware indicators. It looks more like a standard system process doing its job.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Dism.exe processing files in a temporary directory, which is part of normal Windows servicing operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

So, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line represents a different event.\n\nFirst, I notice that multiple events are from \"Dism.exe\" and involve file executions detected by Windows Defender or similar logging mechanisms. The files being detected are all DLLs located in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. These DLLs have names like SetupPlatformProvider.dll, SmiProvider.dll, etc.\n\nThen there's an event from \"DismHost.exe\" with a command line that includes the path to dismhost.exe and a GUID. Following that, several Image Load events are logged for various DLLs loaded by DismHost.exe.\n\nI recall that DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing images. It's commonly used in system deployment and maintenance, such as applying updates or configuring settings. The temporary directory path seems standard for where DISM might extract files during operations.\n\nLooking at the events: Dism.exe executing files is normal when it's part of the imaging process. The creation of DismHost.exe and loading of these providers (DLLs) also aligns with how DISM operates, as these are likely necessary components for the tool to function properly.\n\nSince all these actions are typical during a system image servicing operation, especially if someone is running DISM commands manually or part of an automated process, there's nothing here that stands out as malicious. No signs of unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or unexpected behavior.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any red flags in this batch.

So, the user is asking if this set of logs is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, I see multiple events where DismHost.exe is loading various DLL files into memory. Each event has a similar structure: the process is DismHost.exe, the task is Image loaded with the rule ImageLoad, and the file path points to different DLLs in a temporary directory under the user's AppData.\n\nThen, after several of these load events, there are entries where Dism.exe is deleting those same DLL files. Each delete event has the task as File Delete logged with the rule FileDeleteDetected, again pointing to specific DLL paths.\n\nI know that DismHost.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services and is used for tasks like servicing images. The temporary directory path looks standard for such operations. Loading and then deleting these files could be part of a normal setup or deployment process. \n\nThe repetition of similar events might indicate a script or automated process handling multiple DLLs, which doesn't immediately raise red flags. However, the fact that all these DLLs are being deleted after loading makes me think they were temporary and not malicious in nature.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here, like unexpected processes or access to sensitive files. Everything seems related to legitimate system operations during deployment or setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file loading and deletion activities associated with DismHost.exe and Dism.exe processes, which are part of Windows Deployment Services.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All the events are related to Dism.exe, which I know is a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing and deployment. The logs show multiple file deletion events logged under different rules like FileDeleteDetected and some file creation time changes.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these files being deleted are in the same temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. The names of the files vary, but many end with .dll and .mui, which are standard file extensions for dynamic link libraries and message resource files in Windows.\n\nI should consider whether these deletions are part of normal system operations. Dism.exe is known to create temporary files during processes like servicing or configuration changes. After completing its task, it's common for the system to clean up by deleting these temporary files. The fact that multiple files are being deleted from a temp directory suggests this might be a routine cleanup process.\n\nThe first event shows File Delete logged and another with File creation time changed. This could be part of Dism.exe's operation where it updates file times or deletes unneeded files after use. Since all events stem from the same process, there doesn't seem to be any indication of malicious activity here. No unusual paths or file names jump out as suspicious.\n\nI should also think about whether multiple deletions in a short period could indicate something malicious, like an attempt to erase evidence. However, given that Dism.exe is a known good process and the files are in a standard temp directory, this doesn't seem likely. Plus, all events are consistent with each other, showing no anomalies or deviations from expected behavior.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, these logs appear to be part of normal system operations rather than malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows Dism.exe performing routine file deletions and updates in a temporary directory, consistent with legitimate Windows operations.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a batch of events in JSONL format and wants me to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation. They've specified that I should analyze the whole batch as a single entity, not per event.\n\nLooking at each event, they all share similar characteristics: the process name is \"Dism.exe\", the task is \"File Delete logged\" under the rule \"FileDeleteDetected\", and the file paths are all within a temporary directory. The files being deleted are various .dll.mui and .dll files related to different providers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dism.exe does. From my knowledge, Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for image servicing and deployment, often used in system updates or deployments. It's part of the operating system, so it's not inherently malicious.\n\nEach event shows that Dism.exe is deleting files from a temporary directory. Temporary directories are common places where applications store temporary files, which they may delete when done. So, this behavior might be normal if it's part of an update or deployment process.\n\nThe repeated nature of these events—each line deletes one file from the same temp folder—is notable but not necessarily suspicious on its own. It could indicate that Dism.exe is cleaning up after itself during an operation.\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility of malicious activity. Could an attacker be using Dism.exe to delete files in a way that's unexpected? While possible, Dism.exe isn't typically associated with malicious activities. More commonly, it's used for legitimate system operations.\n\nThe file paths point to various providers (like MsiProvider, SetupPlatformProvider), which are part of standard Windows operations. These aren't signs of malicious intent but rather normal parts of the system's operation, especially during updates or installations.\n\nThere's no indication in these events of any unusual access patterns, such as deletions occurring outside of expected times or volumes beyond what would be typical for Dism.exe usage. Also, since all files are being deleted from a temporary directory, it aligns with how many legitimate processes handle their temporary data.\n\nGiven that there's no other information suggesting foul play, like multiple failed attempts, unusual file names, or access from an unknown source, the events seem to fall within normal system behavior.\n\nTherefore, while I should always be cautious and consider context, in this case, the batch of events likely represents legitimate operations by Dism.exe cleaning up temporary files. There's no strong evidence pointing towards malicious activity here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe cybersecurity analysis of the provided JSONL data indicates that the events are related to file deletions performed by the `Dism.exe` process. These events appear to be part of a legitimate system operation, likely during an update or deployment process, and there is no clear indication of malicious intent based on the information provided.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Process Name**: The process name `Dism.exe` is associated with the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) and is used for servicing and deploying Windows images. It is a legitimate system tool.\n   \n2. **File Deletions**: The files being deleted are located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\...AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`). This is consistent with normal system operations where temporary files are created and deleted as part of updates, installations, or other servicing tasks.\n\n3. **File Types**: The deleted files include various `.dll.mui` and `.dll` files related to different providers (e.g., `MsiProvider`, `VhdProvider`). These are standard components used in Windows deployment and servicing operations.\n\n4. **Event Consistency**: All events show consistent file deletion patterns, which aligns with the expected behavior of `Dism.exe` during servicing tasks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe events described do not exhibit signs of malicious activity. They appear to be part of a legitimate system operation involving the servicing or deployment of Windows images using `Dism.exe`. However, if these events occur outside of an expected update or deployment context, further investigation may be warranted to ensure they are indeed part of a legitimate process.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cybersecurity_analysis\": {\n    \"status\": \" benign\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The events are consistent with normal system operations involving file deletions by Dism.exe during servicing or deployment tasks.

Let's see what the events are.\n\nEach line starts with a JSON object containing three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process is always 'Dism.exe', which I know stands for Deployment Image Service Installer. That's a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing Windows images, like installing updates or adding features.\n\nThe winlog field consistently shows a task named 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. This indicates that the system detected a file deletion event, probably through some security monitoring rule.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different DLL files inside a temporary folder under the user's AppData directory. The paths vary by filename, but each seems to be a provider DLL related to various Windows functionalities—like FolderProvider.dll, GenericProvider.dll, etc. These are standard components used during system setup or servicing operations.\n\nNow, considering Dism.exe is a legitimate process for system administration, deleting these files doesn't seem unusual if it's part of a normal operation, such as cleaning up temporary files after an imaging task. The repeated deletions of multiple DLLs might look suspicious at first glance because multiple file deletion events could trigger alerts, but in this case, they all stem from the same process and point to expected behavior.\n\nI should also consider the context: if Dism.exe is running during a system update or deployment, it's normal for it to delete temporary files. Without additional context indicating unusual activity like failed attempts, access denials, or non-standard times (like outside of business hours), there's no clear sign of malicious intent here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the process is legitimate, the actions are standard deletions during servicing, and there's no evidence of anomalies in the events.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this data that someone provided. It seems to be logs from some system, possibly related to cybersecurity or process monitoring. The user included a JSON-like structure with entries containing \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and sometimes \"file\" information.\n\nFirst, I notice the first entry has a complex string under \"data.\" It looks like a long JSON object with elements like \"process_name,\" \"parent_process,\" etc. This might be an event log from something like Sysmon or another monitoring tool. The presence of fields like \"command_line\" and \"file\" suggests it's tracking processes and their associated files.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where different processes are being logged, such as services.exe, sppsvc.exe, svchost.exe, and powershell.exe with various tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, etc. There's also a file path for mscoree.dll and others under the \"file\" key.\n\nI see that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed, sometimes with command lines that remove specific files or create temporary scripts. For example, one entry shows a command line argument that deletes a zip file in the Temp directory: Remove-Item $env:Temp\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force. Another entry shows creating and then deleting a PowerShell script test file.\n\nMy initial thought is that this might be part of an attack or malicious activity because powershell.exe is often used by attackers for executing scripts, especially with command-line arguments that delete files or create temporary ones which are suspicious.\n\nI should consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes**: Powershell.exe being called multiple times, especially with specific commands to delete files and create scripts in the Temp directory, raises a red flag. This could indicate malware trying to clean up traces of itself or dropping malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**: There are entries where services like svchost.exe and others modify registry values. Malware often uses registry keys to maintain persistence between reboots, so this activity should be investigated.\n\n3. **Image Loads**: The multiple image loads from system directories (like System32) might be normal, but if they're associated with suspicious processes, it could indicate that the malware is loading malicious DLLs or using legitimate ones for malicious purposes.\n\n4. **File Operations**: Creating and then deleting a script file in the Temp directory suggests an attempt to execute code temporarily without leaving evidence. The deletion of the zip file might be an effort to remove files that could be traced back to malicious activity.\n\n5. **Event Correlation**: It's important to correlate these events over time. If powershell.exe is creating, accessing, and deleting files in quick succession, it might be part of a payload execution chain.\n\n6. **Investigating File Hashes**: If possible, check the hashes of the files being accessed or deleted against known malicious file hashes. This could confirm if they're part of a known threat.\n\n7. **Process Monitoring**: Look into why these processes are starting and who is triggering them. Are there unusual user accounts or service permissions associated with these activities?\n\n8. **Network Activity**: Check if any network connections were made during this time from these processes, which could indicate exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server.\n\n9. **Log Analysis**: Review the complete logs around the timestamps of these events to see if there's a sequence that indicates an attack pattern. For example, service.exe and others might be part of a larger infection process.\n\n10. **Mitigation**: If this is part of a live incident, consider isolating the affected system, running anti-malware scans, and applying patches to known vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions without more data. It's possible that some of these actions are legitimate, especially if they're from services or processes that normally perform such operations. However, the combination here seems concerning enough to warrant a deeper investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs provided indicate potential malicious activity on the system. Here's a structured analysis based on the observations:\n\n1. **Suspicious Processes**:\n   - **Powershell.exe**: Multiple instances of powershell.exe are detected with command-line arguments that suggest file deletion and script execution in temporary directories. This is concerning as PowerShell is often abused by malware for executing malicious scripts.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Entries show registry value modifications by processes like svchost.exe, which could indicate attempts to maintain persistence across system reboots—a common tactic in malware.\n\n3. **Image Loads**:\n   - The loading of DLLs from system directories (e.g., System32) is noted. While these might be legitimate, their association with suspicious processes raises the possibility of malicious activity.\n\n4. **File Operations**:\n   - Creation and subsequent deletion of a script file in the Temp directory suggest an attempt to execute code temporarily without leaving traces.\n   - Deletion of files (e.g., .zip) could indicate efforts to remove evidence of malicious activities.\n\n5. **Event Correlation**:\n   - The sequence of events involving powershell.exe creating, accessing, and deleting files within a short timeframe may be part of a payload execution chain.\n\n6. **Mitigation and Investigation Steps**:\n   - **File Analysis**: Check the hashes of accessed files against known malicious file databases.\n   - **Process Monitoring**: Investigate why these processes are running and if they have unusual permissions or user associations.\n   - **Network Checks**: Look for any network activity from these processes that might indicate communication with external servers.\n   - **Log Review**: Examine broader logs around the event timestamps to identify patterns indicative of an attack.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   The combination of registry modifications, file operations, and PowerShell usage strongly suggests potential malicious activity. Immediate steps should include isolating the system, running anti-malware scans, and applying security patches to mitigate risks.\n\nIn summary, the logs point towards possible malware infection, emphasizing the need for thorough investigation and appropriate mitigation strategies."}

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the JSONL data, each line represents an event with process information, Windows log task details, and file info. The first few events are from powershell.exe doing things like creating pipes, loading images, and accessing registry values. Then there are multiple events where the command line of PowerShell is being executed with specific commands.\n\nThe command lines in these events look suspicious. For example, one command is \"Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\" which seems simple but might be part of a larger script. Another command tries to get INI files and checks for specific patterns related to installation sections. That could indicate something malicious because it's scanning system files.\n\nAlso, the fact that PowerShell is being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted might be a red flag. Attackers sometimes use this to execute scripts that have certain restrictions bypassed. The repeated calls to Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks in Windows logs make me think there's ongoing activity from PowerShell, which could be part of a script trying to gather information or perform actions across the system.\n\nThe file paths being accessed, like C:\\Windows\\inf\\*.inf, are common locations for system files. If an attacker is looking through these, it might mean they're trying to find something specific, possibly related to drivers or system configurations that could be exploited.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a lot of PowerShell activity with potentially malicious intent. The repeated execution and file accesses suggest a script running multiple times, maybe attempting to stay undetected or perform tasks in phases.

The first few events have a more complex command involving checking for certain patterns in .inf files. The later events are simpler, deleting files from the Temp directory.\n\nI recall that powershell can be used both legitimately and maliciously. However, in this case, the initial commands seem to be searching through system INF files which might indicate some kind of system probing or component analysis. The second part deletes a specific file pattern in the Temp directory, which is another common activity that could have benign purposes, like cleaning up temporary files.\n\nLooking at the log task fields, they alternate between 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'.

The use of powershell with ExecutionPolicy Restricted is a bit unusual because that policy typically restricts the execution of scripts unless they're explicitly trusted. Using such policies could indicate an attempt to bypass script block restrictions, which might be a red flag. However, in some legitimate scenarios, especially in environments where scripts are controlled, this setting could be standard.\n\nThe repeated attempts to delete files from the Temp directory with the same command could also raise suspicion if there's no clear justification for such repetitive actions.

They could be part of legitimate system administration tasks or automated processes. However, the combination does warrant attention because powershell is a common tool for attackers, and certain command patterns can be indicative of specific behaviors.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to the repeated use of restricted execution policies and file deletion commands, which could hint at potential malicious intent or at least unusual activity that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe executing commands with ExecutionPolicy Restricted, possibly indicating an attempt to hide malicious activities.
