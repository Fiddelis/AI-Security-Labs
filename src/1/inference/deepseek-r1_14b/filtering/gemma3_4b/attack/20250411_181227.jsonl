Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the command lines in several events: multiple powershell.exe processes are being used with commands that create scheduled tasks. The actions involve executing calc.exe, which is a common but usually harmless executable. However, creating scheduled tasks under the Administrators group with highest privileges could be a sign of persistence mechanisms often used by malware.\n\nThe winlog entries mention 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Process Create', 'Registry value set', etc. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity as attackers might try to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nThere are also instances where chrome.exe is involved in pipe creation and registry events, which seems normal but could be part of a broader attack if combined with other activities.\n\nConsidering the repetition: several identical commands creating scheduled tasks with similar names (like 'unidade_ativo', 'registro_geral') suggests automation or script execution, possibly from an attacker trying to establish persistence across reboots.\n\nThe file paths are either None or point to standard system files, so no immediate red flags there. But the combination of multiple scheduled task creations and registry changes is concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: these events could indicate a potential attack where an adversary is using PowerShell to create malicious scheduled tasks for persistence. The repetitive nature and use of high privileges add to the suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, executed under Administrator privileges, indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is powershell.exe loading different image files. Powershell is a common tool for both admins and attackers, so any unusual activity here could be suspicious. The first few events show ImageLoad tasks, which are normal when software loads DLLs, but I need to see if these paths look legitimate.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to point to system directories like Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender components. Those are standard locations, so maybe this is just regular operation. But then there's an event where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. That looks temporary, but it could be part of some script execution.\n\nNext, that same file gets deleted, which makes sense if it was just testing something. Then there's an event where a pipe is created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad, but in the context of other events, it might raise an eyebrow.\n\nNow comes a command line action in powershell.exe that runs a script to create a scheduled task. The script uses New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is typically harmless, but creating tasks with admin rights and highest run level could be an indicator of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. Also, the scheduled task name 'estrutura_auxiliar' doesn't seem to have any obvious malicious connotations, but it's unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying registry values. Chrome does make registry changes during updates or configuration, so this is probably normal unless they're making unauthorized changes. But without more context, I can't be sure if this is suspicious.\n\nThe later events show tasks where the process name is None and the task is 'Execute a Remote Command'. This is concerning because it suggests some remote execution activity. Without knowing what's triggering these commands, it's hard to say, but multiple such events could indicate command-and-control or remote access attacks.\n\nPutting it all together: there are signs of Powershell executing scripts that create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and later remote command executions. These patterns can be indicators of malicious activities like persistence or lateral movement within a network. The confidence level is high because while some actions aren't conclusive, the combination points towards potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows suspicious PowerShell activity including script execution, scheduled task creation with admin privileges, and multiple remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's start by going through each event one by one.\n\nThe first nine entries all have the same structure: process is None, winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and file is None. That seems repetitive, but I'm not sure what to make of it yet. Maybe it's just a common activity, or maybe it's part of an attack pattern.\n\nThen there's an event where the process command line is powershell.exe with some script that creates a scheduled task. The script uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and sets it to run calc.exe at logon for Administrators with highest privileges. That caught my attention because PowerShell scripting, especially creating scheduled tasks, can be a red flag for malicious activities. The fact that it's using the AtLogon trigger and targeting Administrators suggests persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking further, there are entries where WmiPrvSE.exe loads taskschd.dll. I know that WmiPrvSE is related to Windows Management Instrumentation, and loading system32\/taskschd.dll sounds normal for task scheduling, but combined with the previous event, it might indicate something's being set up in the background.\n\nNext are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common process that hosts various services, so by itself it's not suspicious. However, repeated registry writes could be part of installing or modifying system settings, which can be malicious if done by unauthorized code.\n\nThere's an event where svchost.exe creates a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks with the name unidade_comum. That path is unusual because Task Scheduler typically stores tasks under %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\TaskScheduler, so creating a task directly in System32 might be an attempt to hide or misplace it.\n\nContinuing through the logs, there are other processes like conhost.exe and chrome.exe accessing registry keys and loading various DLLs. Chrome accessing Amsi.dll is normal for anti-malware scanning, but repeated registry accesses could be part of data collection or persistence mechanisms.\n\nOne event stands out: powershell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory under Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. This might indicate that PowerShell is being used to create a profile for non-interactive sessions, which can be a way for scripts to run at startup without user interaction.\n\nAnother event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a config file in the downloads folder. That's probably related to log management and not suspicious on its own unless it's part of an exfiltration attempt, but there's no indication here.\n\nThe last entry has powershell.exe creating a file named entrada_principal.txt in the user's Downloads directory. The name suggests it might be some kind of main entry point or configuration file, which could be related to malicious activities if it contains scripts or commands.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple remote command executions, suspicious scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, unusual file creations in system directories and user spaces, registry modifications, and the use of tools like PowerShell and WmiPrvSE. These patterns are common in attack chains—like creating persistence points, dropping files, and using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nWhile each individual event might not be alarming, the combination over the batch suggests potential malicious activity. The confidence isn't super high because some events could be benign, but the cluster of indicators points towards something值得关注.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs indicate potentially malicious activities such as remote command executions, suspicious scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, and file operations that may suggest persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Let me start by going through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first eight entries all show the process as chrome.exe and the winlog task as 'Registry value set'. This seems normal because Chrome often interacts with the Windows registry for settings and extensions. I don't see any immediate red flags here since these events are common during browser operations.\n\nThen there's a ninth event where the process is still chrome.exe, but this time it's a DNS query. Again, that's standard behavior when navigating to websites or loading content. No cause for concern yet.\n\nThe tenth entry shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file at a specific path. Winlogbeat is an agent used for collecting Windows logs, so it makes sense for it to create configuration files like .winlogbeat.yml.new. This activity is expected and doesn't raise any alarms.\n\nThe last event is powershell.exe creating a file named objeto_auxiliar.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be misused by attackers. The creation of this file could be suspicious, especially since it's not immediately clear what its purpose is. However, without more context or unusual behavior preceding this event, such as multiple creations or attempts to execute the file, it might just be a legitimate script execution.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, while there are some events that could potentially be concerning (like the PowerShell activity), they don't appear to be part of a larger pattern indicating malicious behavior. The repeated registry writes by Chrome and the DNS query fit normal user activity. The creation of files by Winlogbeat and PowerShell alone aren't enough evidence without additional indicators like failed processes, access to restricted areas, or network anomalies.\n\nTherefore, considering all events collectively, there's no clear sign of a security incident. While caution is always advised with events involving powerful tools like PowerShell, this batch doesn't meet the threshold for being classified as interesting in terms of investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity, including Chrome registry interactions and legitimate file creations by Winlogbeat and PowerShell. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
