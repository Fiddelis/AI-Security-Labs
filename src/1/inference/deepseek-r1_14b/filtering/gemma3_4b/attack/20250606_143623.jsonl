That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command-line tasks and can be a vector for malicious activities. Noticing that it's being executed with specific commands might indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking at the events, there are Process Create and RegistryEvent tasks related to powershell.exe. This could mean the script is creating services or modifying registry entries, which might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms. Also, the command line in one event shows a PowerShell script that creates a new service with a name \"objeto_ativo\" and sets its binary path. That's concerning because it suggests the creation of a malicious service.\n\nAnother point is the file events: there's a file being created and then immediately deleted. This behavior can be indicative of a script trying to avoid detection by not leaving traces, which is common in attacks. The file paths involved are temporary, so it's likely an attempt to execute code without persisting on disk beyond what's necessary.\n\nThe services.exe process also has multiple RegistryEvent tasks. Since services.exe is related to system services, frequent writes to the registry could be part of installing or modifying services, which aligns with creating a persistent backdoor.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe for creating services and modifying the registry, combined with the temporary file creation and deletion, suggests potential malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is svchost.exe and the task is a Registry value set. Svchost is a common system process that can be legitimate but also sometimes used by malware. The fact that it's modifying registry values could be suspicious, especially if it's happening repeatedly. However, I know that svchost is often used for various services, so this alone might not be enough to raise red flags.\n\nThen, there are several events from setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft Edge directory. Setup.exe is commonly associated with software installations or updates. The paths mentioned look like standard locations for installed programs. It's a bit odd that it's creating multiple files and also modifying registry entries, but since these are all related to Microsoft Edge, which is a legitimate application, this might just be part of an update process.\n\nLooking further, there's an event from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is another system-related process, often involved with running apps in Windows. Again, while it can be malicious, it's also used legitimately for various tasks.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that all these events are happening across multiple processes and files. If this were a single event or isolated incident, it might not be concerning, but the repetition makes me think there could be something more to investigate. Maybe it's part of an installation routine, or perhaps it's a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence.\n\nThe confidence level here is moderate. While some actions seem suspicious, they are also common in legitimate software operations. Without additional context like timestamps or other indicators, it's hard to say definitively, but the combination of these events does warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying registry values and setup.exe creating files in a Microsoft Edge directory suggest potential system configuration changes that may indicate malicious activity or legitimate software updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the majority of these events are from processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. These are all common system processes in Windows, so seeing activity from them isn't unusual on its own.\n\nThe types of tasks logged include \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted\". Registry modifications can be part of normal system operations, especially during installations or updates. However, repeated registry changes by the same process might raise suspicion if they're outside the expected patterns.\n\nLooking at the specific events:\n- There are multiple entries where svchost.exe is setting registry values. I know that svchost.exe is a generic host process for services, so it's not inherently malicious, but too many registry writes could be concerning.\n- Services.exe also has similar activities, which again isn't unusual since it's related to system services.\n\nThen there are some entries from setup.exe creating files and pipes. Setup.exe typically handles installations, so creating new files or pipes during an install is normal. The paths mentioned for Edge-related executables (like msedge_proxy.exe and pwahelper.exe) seem legitimate as part of a browser installation or update.\n\nThe file creation events in various locations like Program Files, System32, and user profile folders also don't immediately flag anything wrong. These are standard places where applications store their data and shortcuts.\n\nI should consider if the number of events is significant. There are over 20 entries here, but many of them are repetitive and from processes that do a lot of normal activity. Unless there's an unusual spike beyond what's expected for these processes, I wouldn't classify it as suspicious based solely on quantity.\n\nLooking at timestamps isn't possible here, but if all these events happened in a short period, that might be more concerning. However, without knowing the time frame, I can't assess that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the file paths are legitimate. The Edge executables and their locations seem correct. If they were in unusual places or attempting to write to restricted areas, that would be a red flag, but here they appear normal.\n\nI should also think about process behavior. For example, setup.exe creating multiple files during an installation makes sense. The creation of pipes might be for inter-process communication, which is standard.\n\nIn summary, while I notice several registry modifications and file creations, these activities align with typical system processes performing installations or updates.

There are multiple entries where setup.exe sets registry values or creates pipes. Then there's an entry from 'RuntimeBroker.exe' doing a registry set, and several events from 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory with various temporary file paths.\n\nHmm, I know that setup.exe is often used for software installations. So these registry changes might be part of normal installation processes, like setting up program shortcuts or configurations. The pipe creations could be related to inter-process communication, which is common during setups.\n\nThe svchost.exe entries creating files in the Temp directory with APPX prefixes make me think they're related to Windows updates or appx package installations. Temporary files are pretty typical during these processes.\n\nI should consider if these activities indicate something malicious. Since all these actions are associated with known system processes and standard operations, it's less likely to be an attack. However, the repetition of similar events, especially multiple file creations by svchost.exe, might warrant a closer look, but on their own, they don't seem suspicious.\n\nSo overall, while there's a lot going on here, nothing jumps out as clearly malicious or indicative of unauthorized access.

Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking at the events, almost all of them are related to PowerShell.exe activities. There are multiple instances where PowerShell is loading images (ImageLoad), creating files (FileCreate), accessing processes (ProcessAccess), and even a command line that shows some script execution. One event stands out because it's using whoami.exe, which is often used to check user information or permissions.\n\nI know that PowerShell can be a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The fact that there are several ImageLoad events suggests that PowerShell might be loading various DLLs or other modules, which could be part of normal operation but also sometimes used in attacks. The creation of temporary files like the .psm1 scripts (PSScriptPolicyTest...) is a bit suspicious because those are script files, and creating them in temp directories can be a sign of malicious activity trying to avoid detection.\n\nThe process access event on PowerShell could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement if it's accessing another process with higher privileges. Also, the specific command line shows that PowerShell was run with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted, which is interesting because sometimes attackers use this to bypass certain restrictions while still executing commands.\n\nThe fact that these events are happening in a sequence and involve multiple file operations, image loads, and even a legitimate tool like whoami.exe could indicate potential reconnaissance or lateral movement. The repeated file creations might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or creating temporary files for malicious activities.\n\nI'm also noticing that some of the file paths point to Windows Defender and .NET Framework components being loaded by PowerShell. While this can be normal, it's worth looking into if these modules are being used in a way that's outside standard operations.\n\nPutting all this together, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, creation of script files in temp directories, and use of whoami.exe makes me think there might be something malicious going on here. The confidence isn't super high because some of these actions could be part of legitimate scripts or system processes, but the pattern definitely raises red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities including file creation in temp directories and process access, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first log shows that powershell.exe was involved in an image load for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's normal because Defender uses PowerShell scripts sometimes.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe process running a command to disable and remove Windows Defender features. This seems suspicious because disabling Defender could be a way to lower system security. I should note that this might indicate someone trying to bypass antivirus protection.\n\nThen, another powershell.exe event with a process access task. Not sure if this is malicious on its own, but combined with the previous cmd activity, it's something to watch.\n\nThe following events all involve Dism.exe creating and accessing various files in a temporary directory. The command line for Dism.exe includes parameters to disable and remove Defender components, which aligns with the earlier cmd command. The creation of multiple DLL files in a temp folder is concerning because it could be related to payload deployment or malicious activities.\n\nI'm thinking that the combination of disabling Defender and creating these files might suggest an attempt to install something harmful or gain persistence on the system. The repeated FileExecutableDetected events for each file are red flags, indicating potentially suspicious activity.\n\nSo, putting all this together, it looks like there's a deliberate effort to remove security features and create new executables, which could be signs of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of disabling Windows Defender features and creation of temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is svchost.exe creating files in AppReadiness paths. Svchost is a common system process, so file creation here isn't unusual. It could be part of normal Windows updates or servicing operations. However, seeing repeated identical file paths might indicate something suspicious, like maybe an attempt to write multiple files as part of malicious activity.\n\nThen there are several registry value sets by svchost.exe. Again, svchost is a legitimate process, and it often interacts with the registry. But multiple writes in quick succession could be a red flag if they're not related to known system operations. I should consider whether these changes are expected or if they might be part of modifying system configurations maliciously.\n\nNext, there's an entry from RuntimeBroker.exe making a registry change. Runtime Broker is responsible for managing UWP app sandboxing. While it can make registry changes, multiple entries here could indicate something off, especially if they're not tied to known app activities.\n\nThe more concerning part comes with the powershell.exe events. The first one shows PowerShell being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and a simple Write-Host command. Using Restricted execution policy is common for minimizing risk, but the command itself seems benign—a straightforward message output.\n\nFollowing that are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various .NET framework components. This is normal when running PowerShell scripts, as they often require these libraries. The paths look legitimate, pointing to standard system and .NET directories.\n\nPutting it all together: svchost.exe creating files in AppReadiness could be part of Windows updates or potentially malicious activity like writing malicious files repeatedly. The registry changes by svchost and RuntimeBroker might not be suspicious on their own but in combination with other events could raise concerns. The powershell.exe execution, while appearing benign, is worth monitoring because even simple commands can sometimes mask malicious intent, especially if they're part of a larger sequence.\n\nHowever, the specific actions here don't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. The svchost file creations and registry changes are within expected system operation parameters, and the powershell.exe activity doesn't indicate anything beyond normal usage. Without more context or additional suspicious events, it's hard to classify this batch as definitely malicious.\n\nTherefore, while there are elements that might warrant closer inspection, especially in a larger context, on their own they don't strongly suggest malicious behavior. So I'd classify this as not interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system processes like svchost.exe and powershell.exe performing routine operations, including file creation and registry modifications, which are typical for system updates or legitimate software activities.

So, seeing this process in itself isn't suspicious.\n\nThe 'winlog' field indicates that each event is classified under the task 'File Executable Detected' with the rule 'FileExecutableDetected'. This suggests that an executable file was detected on the system.

The filenames vary but follow a pattern like 'SmiProvider.dll.mui', 'SysprepProvider.dll.mui', etc. These files are part of Windows' servicing stack, which Dism.exe uses to manage and update system images.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, there are 14 events all from the same process and same task type. The repeated detection is due to Dism.exe processing multiple files as part of its normal operation during an OS deployment or servicing. Since Dism.exe is a standard tool and the activities it's performing align with its known behavior, there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here.\n\nI don't see any red flags such as unknown processes, unexpected file accesses, or unusual patterns in the timestamps or paths.

It's a tool used in Windows for servicing operating system images, like installing updates or adding drivers. So, it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at each event, most of them have \"File Delete logged\" tasks. Only one is about changing the file creation time. The files being deleted are various DLLs and MUI (multi-language) files located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nHmm, why would Dism.exe be deleting these files? Well, during normal operations, when you're working with system images or performing certain updates, it's common for temporary files to be created and then deleted. The path looks like something that would be generated by a process extracting or deploying components, which aligns with what Dism does.\n\nThe paths are quite long but follow a standard structure. They’re all in the same temp folder, which suggests they were part of a single operation. There's no indication here of anything suspicious beyond regular file handling during servicing tasks.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual access times or multiple failed attempts that might indicate a breach. The files being deleted are typical components you'd expect from such a process. Since all events come from the same source and relate to a legitimate activity, it's unlikely they're part of malicious behavior.\n\nSo putting this together, while the volume of deletions is notable, each event aligns with what Dism.exe does normally.

Let's take a closer look.\n\nEach event has three main parts: process, winlog, and file. The process is always Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Imaging Service and Management. That tool is typically used in Windows for image-based installations and updates, so it's a legitimate system process.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every event shows that there was a file delete logged under the rule FileDeleteDetected. This suggests that something triggered an alert when these files were deleted.\n\nThe file paths all point to different DLLs located in a temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\. The filenames vary, but they all end with .dll and seem to be related to providers like FfuProvider, FolderProvider, etc.\n\nNow, considering the context: Dism.exe is a known legitimate tool. It's common for it to delete files during its operations, especially when cleaning up after imaging tasks or updates. The fact that multiple DLLs are being deleted might look suspicious at first glance, but in this case, it seems consistent with normal system behavior.\n\nI don't see any red flags like unusual file types, execution from unexpected locations, or multiple failed attempts which might indicate malicious activity. Since all events come from the same process and target temporary files, it's likely that Dism.exe is just doing its routine cleanup after an operation.\n\nTherefore, while each event individually might seem notable, together they don't point to anything malicious.

The first thing I notice is that all these events are from the same process: \"Dism.exe\". That's interesting because Dism usually stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which is used for servicing Windows images. It's a legitimate system utility, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have the same task in winlog: \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". So, Dism.exe is deleting files, which is expected if it's doing some cleanup or servicing operations. The file paths are all under a temporary directory path: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\en-US\\\" followed by various DLL files like IBSProvider.dll.mui, ImagingProvider.dll.mui, and so on.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these deletions are normal. Since Dism.exe is involved in servicing operations, it's common for it to create temporary files during its processes and then delete them afterward. The pattern here shows multiple file deletions from the same temp directory, which aligns with standard operating procedures of such a tool.\n\nNow, considering malicious activities, I wonder if these events could be part of an attack. However, Dism.exe is signed by Microsoft, so it's not a known malicious process. Also, the files being deleted are MUI (Multi-User Interface) DLLs, which are language-pack related. It makes sense for Dism to handle these during image servicing.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? The number of events here is 14 consecutive deletions from the same process and temp directory. While that's a lot, it doesn't necessarily indicate malicious behavior on its own. If this were an unfamiliar process or if the files being deleted were in unexpected locations or contained suspicious names, I'd be more concerned.\n\nI should also think about whether these events could be part of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) where attackers use legitimate tools for their activities. However, without any other indicators like unusual file hashes, process behaviors outside the known patterns of Dism.exe, or deviations from normal operating hours, it's hard to classify this as malicious.\n\nAnother angle is checking if the temp directory path is standard. The GUID in the path (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) suggests a temporary folder created by a legitimate process, which aligns with Dism's operation.\n\nIn summary, while multiple file deletions can sometimes indicate suspicious activity, in this case, the consistent use of Dism.exe and standard file types and paths point towards normal system operations rather than malicious intent.

The fact that it's using \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" suggests some kind of script execution. In most cases, restricted mode limits the ability to run scripts, but sometimes attackers might try to bypass certain restrictions or use this as a way to execute commands that seem less suspicious.\n\nThe command lines vary slightly. Some just output 'Final result: 1' using Write-Host, while others are more complex. The latter ones retrieve files from the Windows directory's INF folder and check for specific patterns in those files. This part seems potentially concerning because accessing system files like *.inf could be related to driver installation or configuration changes. If an attacker is looking for certain signatures in these files, it might indicate they're trying to identify vulnerabilities or configurations that could be exploited.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most events have a task of 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks relate to Windows event logs themselves, dealing with how logging providers are started or stopped and engine operations. It's a bit meta since these logs are about log handling, which could mean someone is monitoring or manipulating the logging system.\n\nThe 'file' field is None in all cases, meaning no file was accessed or modified during these events. That’s interesting because if they were accessing files, it might be more suspicious, but here it's just process and log-related activities.\n\nNow, considering the entire batch: there are multiple repeated entries, which suggests automated execution of scripts. The repetition could indicate a script running multiple times, perhaps testing different aspects or trying to avoid detection by spreading out the activity. The use of Write-Host in some commands is benign, but when combined with the file system access and specific patterns being checked in INF files, it raises questions about what's being assessed.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread across several log entries might be an attempt to normalize behavior or avoid detection by not overwhelming the logs at once. But the combination of PowerShell execution, checking for specific file patterns, and dealing with Windows logging mechanisms makes this batch stand out as potentially malicious activity.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible scenarios: could this be part of a legitimate script that's auditing system files? Maybe, but given the command structure and repetition, it seems more likely to be something else. The repeated use of \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" in PowerShell might be an attempt to run scripts without triggering certain warnings or restrictions, which is a common tactic for attackers.\n\nIn summary, while some of these actions on their own aren't necessarily malicious, the combination—specifically the repeated PowerShell commands accessing system files and interacting with event logs—points towards behavior that should be investigated. There's a high confidence level here because the patterns align with tactics used in cyberattacks, such as persistence, lateral movement, or information gathering.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands accessing system files and interacting with event logs may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each line has a process, winlog, and file entry. My task is to analyze the entire batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLet me go through each event one by one:\n\n1. The first event has a process with command_line that runs powershell.exe with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. It then executes some script that reads .inf files in Windows directory and checks for specific patterns. This seems suspicious because using Powershell, especially with restricted execution policies, might be trying to hide something or execute malicious commands.\n\n2. The second event has no process information, but the winlog task is 'Security Group Management'. That's a standard log related to user group changes, which isn't immediately concerning on its own.\n\n3. The third event shows process name as services.exe and winlog task as 'Logon'. Services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, handling service-related tasks. Logon events are common and usually not malicious unless there's an unusual pattern or time.\n\n4. The fourth event again has no process, but the logon type is 'Special', which might refer to system accounts or other non-interactive sessions. This isn't inherently suspicious.\n\nPutting them together: The first event stands out because it's using Powershell with a restricted policy and accessing .inf files. The script checks for specific patterns that could be related to detecting or installing drivers. Malicious actors often use Powershell due to its scripting capabilities and the ability to execute commands quietly. However, since it's under a restricted execution policy, maybe it's trying to avoid detection or is part of legitimate administrative tasks.\n\nThe other events are either standard system processes (services.exe) or regular logon activities. No file entries in any of them, which might mean no direct evidence of file changes or downloads.\n\nI'm leaning towards 'INTERESTING' because the Powershell command could be attempting something malicious, especially accessing .inf files which are related to device drivers and could be targets for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms. However, without more context like timestamps showing unusual activity times or multiple such events, it's hard to say definitively if this is an attack.\n\nThe confidence level would be moderate because while the Powershell command is concerning, there's no strong evidence beyond that single event suggesting malicious behavior in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious PowerShell command attempting to access .inf files and check for specific patterns, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this JSON data that's been provided. It seems to be a series of logs related to processes and events on a Windows system. Each entry has three fields: process, winlog, and file.\n\nStarting with the first log, it mentions \"New\" under the process field, which probably indicates a new process being created. The command line is quite long, but I can see that it's using powershell.exe to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\". It specifies the binary path as \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\" and then starts that service.\n\nI'm noticing that this same command line appears multiple times. Maybe the script is running in a loop or trying to create the service multiple times. Each time, it's captured as a separate event, which makes sense if it's part of some automated process or a script that runs periodically.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, most entries are under \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These terms probably relate to how Windows handles services and their dependencies. The fact that there are multiple events with these tasks suggests that the system is managing several components or services.\n\nI also see an entry where the process name is \"svchost.exe\", which is a common host process for Windows services. It's associated with a registry value being set, so this might be part of the service creation or configuration process.\n\nThere are some entries where the process field is \"None\" and the file is \"None\". These might represent events that don't involve a specific process or file operation, perhaps just system-level activities.\n\nThe last few logs show powershell.exe commands being executed with an execution policy set to Restricted. This could mean that the script is running under certain constraints, possibly for security reasons. The command writes a message to the host indicating the result is \"1\".\n\nI'm wondering what the overall purpose of these scripts is. It seems like they're setting up or managing some service on the system, maybe related to network activities or data processing. The repeated attempts to create and start the service might indicate an automated setup process or a script trying different configurations.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. Sometimes, attackers use powershell for malicious purposes, so it's important to verify if these scripts are authorized. The fact that the execution policy is set to Restricted could be a security measure, but it's also something to double-check.\n\nI'm not sure about all the technical details here, like what \"objeto_ativo\" and \"tarefa_logico.exe\" do. Maybe they're custom services for specific applications on the system. The paths in the binary path name suggest they're located in a structured directory, which is a good practice for organization.\n\nIn summary, these logs show powershell scripts creating and managing a service named \"objeto_ativo\". They might be part of a legitimate setup process or something else. Without more context, it's hard to say if this activity is suspicious or normal. I should probably look into what \"objeto_ativo\" does and ensure that all these processes are authorized on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON data appears to represent log entries from a Windows system, potentially captured by some monitoring tool or security software. Each entry contains information about a process being created or modified, along with associated details such as command lines, event types, and file paths.\n\nHere's an analysis of the key components:\n\n1. **Process Creation Events:**\n   - Multiple events indicate that `powershell.exe` is being used to create a new service named `\"objeto_ativo\"`. The binary path for this service points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n   - These events are marked as part of the \"Provider Lifecycle\", which typically relates to the creation or modification of Windows services.\n\n2. **Command Line Details:**\n   - The command line for each event includes a PowerShell script that creates a new service and starts it. Here's an example:\n     ```powershell\n     powershell.exe & {New-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\" -BinaryPathName \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" Start-Service -Name \"objeto_ativo\"}\n     ```\n   - This suggests that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a loop or repeated attempts to ensure the service is running.\n\n3. **Restricted Execution Policy:**\n   - Some events show `powershell.exe` being executed with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag, which indicates that PowerShell is running in a restricted mode where certain operations might be blocked for security reasons.\n\n4. **svchost.exe Activity:**\n   - An entry shows `svchost.exe`, a common Windows process used to host other services, creating a registry value. This could relate to the creation or configuration of the `objeto_ativo` service.\n\n5. **Final Result Event:**\n   - The last few events show a PowerShell command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the console using `Write-Host`, indicating that the script completed successfully.\n\n### Possible Interpretations:\n- These logs could be part of an automated system or script designed to ensure that a specific service (`objeto_ativo`) is running on the system. The repeated attempts might indicate a mechanism to handle potential failures or restarts.\n- Given the use of `powershell.exe` and the restricted execution policy, this activity could also be part of legitimate administrative tasks, though it would be wise to verify the origin and purpose of these scripts.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Verify Legitimacy:**\n   - Check if the service `objeto_ativo` is a known component of your system or software. If not, investigate its source.\n   \n2. **Analyze Scripts:**\n   - Review the contents of `tarefa_logico.exe` and the PowerShell script to ensure they are not performing unauthorized actions.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n   - Look for unusual patterns in process creation events or repeated attempts to start services, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\n\n4. **Log Correlation:**\n   - Combine these logs with other data sources (e.g., network traffic, user activity) to get a fuller picture of what's happening on the system.\n\nIf you're concerned about the legitimacy of this activity, further investigation into the purpose and origin of the `objeto_ativo` service and associated scripts is recommended."}
