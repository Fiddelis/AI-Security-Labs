Let me go through each event one by one to see if anything stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nThe first event is whoami.exe being executed. That's usually harmless; it's just displaying user information. Nothing suspicious here.\n\nNext up, powershell.exe accessed. Powershell can be used for both legitimate tasks and attacks. But without more context, like specific commands, I'm not sure if this is bad. Maybe the user is running a script or automating something.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch log shipping tool, so it making configuration files makes sense. No red flags here.\n\nThe fourth event catches my eye: cmd.exe with a command line that uses certutil to encode calc.exe into a text file and then decode it. This is concerning because I know that attackers often use certutil to encode malicious payloads since it's allowed in many environments. The fact that they're using both encode and decode suggests they're trying to create an executable from these files.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple events with certutil.exe doing similar actionsâ€”encoding and decoding files into .exe. This is a common technique for evading detection because the tool itself isn't malicious, but its misuse can be part of an attack chain.\n\nI also see rundll32.exe being used to call PcaSvc.dll, which is legitimate for patching in some cases, so that might not be suspicious on its own. The SDXHelper.exe loading various DLLs doesn't immediately raise a flag unless those DLLs are known bad actors.\n\nThe chrome.exe events show network connections and registry changes. While unusual, many applications do this, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated use of certutil with calc.exe is a strong indicator that something might be off. Attackers often target legitimate tools like certutil to hide their payload. The creation and execution of these encoded files could indicate an attempt to drop or execute malicious code on the system. So, this batch seems relevant for further investigation because it shows signs of potential file encoding and execution techniques commonly used in cyberattacks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events involving the use of certutil.exe to encode and decode files, which is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads.
