This script is known for logging keystrokes, which is a common tactic in malware to capture sensitive information.\n\nThe second event shows an attempt to execute a remote command involving the same script. Remote commands can be indicators of malicious activity, especially when combined with other suspicious actions like file creation.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where files are being created by PowerShell and svchost.exe. These processes creating files in user directories (like Downloads) could be setting up persistence or storing stolen data. The file paths mentioned don't seem to align with normal system operations, adding suspicion.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows signs of malicious behavior: running a keystroke logger via PowerShell, attempting remote execution, and creating unusual files. These activities are red flags for potential cyber threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potentially malicious activity involving Powershell executing a script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) known for keystroke logging, along with file creation in user directories and remote command execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see several entries from chrome.exe modifying the registry. That's a bit unusual because Chrome typically doesn't change system-wide registry settings unless it's updating its own extensions or components. But having multiple such events might indicate something more is happening.\n\nThen there are multiple powershell.exe processes with different command lines running scripts that seem to log keystrokes. The fact that these scripts are located in various paths like \"C:\\modulo_padrao\\...\" and similar seems suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common tactic for malware, so this could be malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, I notice powershell.exe accessing and creating files, specifically a temporary .ps1 script which is then deleted shortly after. This behavior might be an attempt to clean up traces of the script execution, which raises red flags.\n\nThere's also a mention of MpOAV.dll being loaded by PowerShell. That file is related to Windows Defender, but it's unusual for PowerShell scripts to interact with antivirus components in this way unless they're trying to evade detection or disable them.\n\nAdditionally, there are process access and image load events from both chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which might be part of legitimate operations but combined with the other activities could indicate a broader compromise.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated registry modifications by Chrome, the execution of multiple PowerShell scripts with similar keystroke logging purposes, the file creation and deletion in temp directories, and interactions with system components like Defender suggest potential malicious behavior. These events don't seem to be part of normal user activity but rather point towards a possible attack or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances executing scripts with potentially malicious intent, including keystroke logging and file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
