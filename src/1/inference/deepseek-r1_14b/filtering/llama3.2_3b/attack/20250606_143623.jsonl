{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if it's interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is \"whoami.exe\" being executed. That seems normal because whoami is a common tool used for querying user information, often used in scripts or troubleshooting. Not immediately suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple events involving powershell.exe. I remember that PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious because it's powerful. Looking at the command lines, one of them has a script that creates a new service with specific commands. The script is creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" which runs tarefa_logico.exe. That caught my attention because creating services via scripts, especially from untrusted sources, can be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are events where files are being created and deleted in the Temporary folder related to PowerShell scripts. The file __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1 is created and then immediately deleted. That seems odd because why create a script only to delete it? It might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or leave no trace, which are common tactics in malware.\n\nThe services.exe process is setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe is legitimate for handling system services, but frequent registry changes could indicate configuration of new services or altering existing ones, possibly malicious.\n\nLooking at tarefa_logico.exe, it's loading .NET framework DLLs, which is normal if it's a legitimate application. But since it's being called from PowerShell, I'm cautious. Also, the file paths and process names don't immediately ring any bells as malicious, but they could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThere are events where setup.exe creates several files under the EdgeCore directory. This might just be installing or updating Microsoft Edge, which is expected behavior. Unless there's something unusual about the files being created, I'm not too concerned here.\n\nPutting it all together: The repeated use of PowerShell with potentially malicious script commands, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, service creation, and registry modifications are red flags. These activities could be indicative of an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute malicious code discreetly.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing potentially malicious scripts, including creating a new service with unusual commands and deleting temporary script files, along with suspicious registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a series of JSONL events here. Each line represents an event with process information, Windows log details, and sometimes file paths.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'setup.exe' creating files in various locations like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore and others. Edge-related files being created by setup.exe seems normal during installation or updates. So, those might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nThen, I see several events from 'svchost.exe' modifying the registry with tasks like setting registry values or adding\/removing registry objects. Svchost is a legitimate Windows process that hosts services, so some registry activity isn't unusual, especially during system updates or software installations.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event where 'powershell.exe' is executed with a command line: \"Write-Host 'Final result: 1';\". The execution policy is set to Restricted, which means it's running in a constrained environment. While this could be a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, the fact that it's restricted might indicate legitimate use, like a script run by an admin or part of system operations.\n\nI also notice several temporary files being created by svchost.exe under C:\\Windows\\Temp with names like APPX followed by various suffixes. These could be related to package deployment or updates, which is normal during Windows processes.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to revolve around legitimate activities such as software installations (setup.exe creating files and registry entries), svchost.exe performing normal service-related tasks, and a restricted PowerShell command that doesn't appear malicious at first glance. There's no indication of unusual process behaviors, multiple failed attempts, or signs of compromise like unexpected network connections or file deletions.\n\nHowever, the 'powershell.exe' execution could be a point to look into if it's not part of the expected system behavior. But since it's under restricted mode and the command is simple, maybe it's just outputting a message as part of some script or process monitoring.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several events that might seem notable individually, collectively they don't present clear signs of malicious activity. They mostly align with normal system operations and updates.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as file creations by setup.exe, registry modifications by svchost.exe and services.exe, and a restricted PowerShell command that doesn't indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first few events are all related to powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, etc. These seem normal because PowerShell often loads these libraries for script execution. Then there’s a file creation in the Windows Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_2bdqlimh.dpa.psm1. That looks suspicious—PowerShell scripts created in temp directories can be indicators of malicious activity.\n\nNext, I see a pipe created event from powershell.exe, which is common for inter-process communication but could also be used for command execution or lateral movement. Another ImageLoad event loads MpClient.dll, which is related to Windows Defender, so that's probably benign.\n\nThen there's an event where whoami.exe is executed. That’s a common tool for gathering system information and could be part of legitimate activity or reconnaissance by attackers. \n\nLooking at the command line in one of the powershell.exe events, it shows a script being executed with Get-Item on *.inf files, checking for specific patterns. This seems like it's looking for driver or component installations, which might be part of an attack to enable persistence or load malicious drivers.\n\nAnother suspicious event is cmd.exe executing Dism commands to disable Windows Defender and remove it without restarting. Disabling antivirus is a common tactic in attacks to prevent detection. Additionally, the Dism.exe process detected executable files in a temporary directory, which could indicate dropped malware components being executed.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple powershell.exe events with file creations, whoami.exe execution, disabling of Windows Defender, and command-line scripts checking for specific patterns—these are red flags. They suggest potential malicious activity like persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within a network.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple indicators suggest potential malicious activities, including suspicious file creations by PowerShell, disabling of Windows Defender using Dism.exe, and commands that may indicate reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that were provided. There are multiple JSON objects, each representing an event. Let me try to parse what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, every event has a \"process\" field indicating the process name is 'Dism.exe'. That rings a bell because Dism.exe is known as the Deployment Image Service Installer. It's typically used for installing Windows updates and performing other system deployment tasks. So, it's a legitimate Microsoft tool.\n\nNext, each event has a \"winlog\" task. The first one says \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the rest are \"File Executable Detected (rule: FileExecutableDetected)\". This means that files are being created or detected as executables in specific locations.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are under 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\...'. The GUID seems to be 33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89. Temporary folders usually contain files that are being processed or downloaded temporarily, which aligns with Dism.exe's behavior when deploying updates.\n\nThe specific files mentioned include various .exe and .dll files, some of which have 'mui' extensions, indicating they might be language-specific resource files. The names like 'DismCore.dll.mui' and 'AssocProvider.dll.mui' suggest these are components used by the Dism tool in different languages or contexts.\n\nPutting this all together, it looks like Dism.exe is creating temporary files as part of its normal operation. It's generating these files during a deployment process, which could be an update installation or system configuration change. Since all events are related to legitimate file operations performed by a known Microsoft utility, there doesn't seem to be any malicious activity here.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious behavior typical in attacks. No unusual processes, no unexpected file modifications outside the temp directory, and all actions align with what Dism.exe is supposed to do. Therefore, these events are likely part of normal system operations rather than a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events provided indicate that the `Dism.exe` process is creating and detecting executable files within a temporary directory as part of its legitimate operation for deploying Windows updates or system configurations.

The common thread here is the process name \"Dism.exe\" or variations like \"DismHost.exe\". \n\nStarting with the first few entries, they all show Dism.exe and a task related to detecting executable files. Each has a file path that's unique but follows a similar pattern, all located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. These events seem routine for when an application is working with various DLLs and checking them as executables.\n\nThen there are two more events involving DismHost.exe. The first one is a process creation event, which is normal when any program starts. The second and third entries show image loading events, which again are standard as part of the execution flow for an application like DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management), commonly used in system imaging and updates.\n\nI'm considering whether these activities could be indicative of malicious behavior. Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, often used during deployment or system repair. Its associated processes and the loading of DLLs are expected behaviors. The repeated file paths all point to temporary files generated by DISM during its operations.\n\nNo signs of unusual process names, unexpected network connections, or writes to restricted areas are present here. All events are confined within standard user directories and involve legitimate system processes. Therefore, while it's always good to monitor such activities, in this case, there's no clear evidence of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events relate to normal operations of the Dism.exe process loading various DLLs and executing within a temporary directory, which is standard behavior for system deployment tools.\",\n  \"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\"\n}"}

Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nI see that the first nine events are all from DismHost.exe with Image loaded tasks. They’re loading various DLL files into memory. That seems normal for an application like DISM, which is related to system deployment and image management. So those might be standard operations.\n\nThen there's the 10th event where DismHost.exe terminates. Processes terminating after their work isn't unusual either, so no red flags here.\n\nFrom the 11th event onwards, it's Dism.exe performing file delete actions on several files in a temporary directory. These include both DLLs and MUI (multilingual) files. DISM often works with temp directories to extract or deploy components, so deleting these files after they're processed is expected behavior.\n\nI'm checking if the paths look suspicious. The temp path has GUID-like names but that's typical for unique temporary folders created by processes. There's no indication of any unauthorized access or malicious activity here.\n\nConsidering all events together, it seems like a legitimate operation during system setup or maintenance.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, they all involve Dism.exe deleting files from a specific path. The same process name and file paths are recurring across multiple events. My initial thought is that Dism.exe is legitimate—it's part of the Windows deployment tools, so it's often used for disk imaging and servicing. It’s not uncommon to see this process delete temporary or unnecessary files during system operations.\n\nEach event logs a file deletion under different *.dll.mui filenames in the same directory. These seem like language-specific resources, which Dism.exe might be cleaning up after an installation or update process. The consistent naming pattern suggests these are part of a package being removed, not random files deleted by malicious code.\n\nI don’t see any red flags here. No unusual paths, encrypted files, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate something suspicious. All deletions are from a known temporary directory, which aligns with standard cleanup procedures.\n\nConsidering the lack of anomalies and the legitimate nature of Dism.exe's operations in this context, the batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Dism.exe deleting language-specific resource files from a temporary directory.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this JSON data that was provided. It seems to be some kind of log or event data, possibly related to cybersecurity since there are mentions of process creation and file operations. Let me try to parse through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial block has a \"process\" field with a long string that looks like it's Base64 encoded. I know that sometimes sensitive information is encoded this way to prevent casual observation. If I were to decode it, maybe I could get more details about what's happening in the process. The command line mentioned is creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable path. That seems suspicious because creating services can be a common tactic in malware or attacks to maintain persistence.\n\nThen there are several entries where both \"process\" and \"winlog\" fields have placeholders like \"None\". These might represent events that didn't capture specific details, perhaps indicating that no file was accessed during those process creations. However, the repeated command line in subsequent entries is creating a service with the same name and path every time, which could be an attempt to ensure the malicious service stays running even if it's deleted or stopped.\n\nLooking at the \"winlog\" field, it mentions tasks like \"Process Create\", \"Provider Lifecycle\". These are typical Windows events indicating that something is being created or modified in terms of services or processes. The fact that these are happening repeatedly might be a red flag for an attack, as attackers often try to establish persistence by continuously trying to create or start services.\n\nThe files involved seem to point to paths like \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That's a bit concerning because it looks like the attacker is using a custom executable stored in a specific directory. The path structure might be designed to avoid detection or blend in with legitimate files.\n\nI'm also noticing that each event has the same process command line, which suggests that this activity might be part of an automated script or tool being run multiple times. This could mean that the attacker is trying different approaches to get the service running without success, or it's a brute-force attempt.\n\nAnother thing I should consider is whether \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service name in the system. If not, its creation could be an indicator of malicious activity. Additionally, the use of powershell.exe with specific commands is another red flag because PowerShell can execute arbitrary code and is often used by attackers for its flexibility and ability to evade detection.\n\nI should also check if there are any missing fields or anomalies in the timestamps or event IDs that might indicate a pattern of attack. Maybe correlating these events with other logs could provide more context, like checking if network connections were made after the service was started or if files were modified.\n\nIn terms of response, if I were to encounter this in a real scenario, I would first isolate the affected system to prevent any potential spread. Then, I'd analyze the processes and services running on the machine, looking specifically for \"objeto_ativo\". Using tools like Process Monitor or Regshot could help identify any changes made by this service.\n\nI should also look into the origin of the powershell.exe command. Was it triggered by a user, another process, or perhaps over the network? Checking event logs for related activities around the same time might reveal more about how this process was initiated.\n\nFurthermore, I'd want to scan the system for any signs of malware or unauthorized access, such as registry changes, new files in unexpected locations, or active network connections. If the service is indeed malicious, stopping and removing it would be necessary steps.\n\nOverall, while each individual event might not be alarming on its own, the combination of repeated process creations with the same command line, use of powershell.exe for service creation, and targeting specific file paths suggests potential malicious activity that needs to be investigated thoroughly.\n<\/think>\n\nThe JSON data provided appears to capture log entries from a Windows system, likely related to cybersecurity incidents. Each entry includes details about processes, windows logs, and files involved.\n\n1. **First Entry:**\n   - **Process:** Contains a Base64-encoded string that, when decoded, reveals a process creation event for `C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe`. The command line shows the creation of a service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable path within a directory structure named \"unidade_logico\". This is suspicious as it suggests unauthorized service creation.\n   - **Windows Log:** Indicates a task related to process creation, which aligns with the creation of a new service.\n\n2. **Subsequent Entries:**\n   - These entries show repeated attempts to create the same service using powershell.exe. The command line consistently targets the same executable path, suggesting potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence on the system.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The repetitive nature of the process creation suggests an automated or script-based attack.\n   - Use of powershell.exe is a common tactic in cyberattacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands without easy detection.\n   - The service named \"objeto_ativo\" might be a custom malicious service designed to persist on the system, possibly for later execution of arbitrary code.\n\n4. **Recommendations:**\n   - **Investigation:** Further investigation is needed to determine if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service or part of known malware.\n   - **Isolation:** If this activity is indicative of an attack, isolating the affected system from the network is crucial to prevent lateral movement by attackers.\n   - **Threat Intelligence:** Checking threat intelligence feeds for any known malicious activities related to the file path and command line used.\n   - **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitoring the system for unusual behavior such as network connections or data exfiltration attempts.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The data points towards potential unauthorized access or malware on the system. Immediate action is required to mitigate risks, including stopping the service if confirmed malicious, and securing the system against future attacks."}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events have the command line as a PowerShell script that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe, and then starts that service. This immediately catches my attention because creating a new service can be a common tactic for persistence. Malware often installs services to run at startup, so this could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple events where PowerShell is being executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. Each runs a Write-Host command to output 'Final result: 1'. The fact that it's using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted might indicate an attempt to limit script execution, but in this case, they're still executing code. Also, restricted mode could mean that some operations are blocked, but the specific commands here don't seem malicious at first glance—they just write to the host.\n\nLooking further, there are a couple of events where PowerShell is querying INF files in the Windows directory's inf folder, searching for lines matching specific patterns related to defaultinstall.nt architectures. This seems like an attempt to check for driver-related information or maybe looking for certain installed components. Inf files are used for hardware installation, so accessing them might be part of legitimate operations, but it can also be a way to gather system information which is often done during reconnaissance.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a new service (potentially persistence), using PowerShell with restricted execution policies (which could hide malicious activities), and querying system files for specific patterns (reconnaissance) makes this batch quite concerning. These actions don't appear to be standard user behavior; they look like part of a potential attack chain—installation, persistence, and information gathering.\n\nI'm also noticing that the same commands are repeated multiple times across different events. This repetition might indicate automated script execution or a loop in the malware's code, which is another red flag. The varied tasks within these events suggest a multi-step process, possibly indicating an active threat rather than normal system operations.\n\nSo overall, this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activities involving service creation, restricted PowerShell commands, and file system queries that could be part of a larger attack. Therefore, it's definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple instances of PowerShell executing scripts with potential persistence mechanisms, including creating a new service and querying system files, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}

The key field to focus on is the \"process\" command line.\n\nSo, all these events involve powershell.exe running with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. That means it's executing some script. Let me read the command: It sets $Res to 0, then looks for INF files in the Windows directory. For each INF file, it reads the content and checks if there's a specific pattern related to defaultinstall.nt architecture.\n\nHmm, so this is checking for certain install sections in INF files. That could be part of legitimate system operations or software installations. But wait, since it's using Powershell with Restricted execution, maybe it's trying to avoid detection by running the script without full privileges.\n\nI wonder if this activity is normal. Typically, scripts that read system files and check their contents might be part of an installation process or a system audit. However, given that it's looking for specific patterns related to default install sections, could it be checking for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations?\n\nAnother angle: Could this be malicious? If the script is trying to identify certain drivers or components and setting $Res based on that, perhaps it's signaling to another process whether a specific condition exists. But without knowing the broader context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlso, looking at the \"winlog\" fields, they mention tasks like Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. These are common in system events when services or components start up or shut down. So maybe this Powershell script is part of a legitimate service check during system startup.\n\nBut considering that multiple events are being generated with the same command line, it might be running across different contexts or on different machines. The repetition could indicate an automated process checking multiple systems or just multiple instances of the same check.\n\nI'm leaning towards it not being malicious because the script seems to be looking for known patterns in INF files, which is something a system admin might do for troubleshooting or configuration verification. However, the use of Powershell with Restricted Execution Policy makes me cautious—attackers often use such techniques to execute code stealthily.\n\nOn the other hand, if this script is part of an organization's standard monitoring tools or automated checks, it would be normal and not malicious at all.
