{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not. First, I notice that a lot of the events are related to PowerShell executing certain commands. The command line in some logs shows \"powershell.exe & {findstr \/si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls | select-string -Pattern password}\". That looks suspicious because it's searching for the word 'pass' in various file types and then selecting lines with 'password'. This could be an attempt to extract sensitive information, like passwords, which is a red flag.\n\nNext, I see multiple events where PowerShell creates and then deletes a temporary script file. The file path is \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\_PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1\". Creating and immediately deleting files can be a tactic to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces, which makes me more cautious.\n\nAlso, there are several ImageLoad events for various DLLs when PowerShell runs. These aren't necessarily malicious on their own but could indicate that the script is loading components or using features that might not be standard.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. While calc.exe is a common tool, executing scripts and loading specific DLLs doesn't align with typical calculator usage and might suggest some form of lateral movement or payload execution.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with commands that search for sensitive information, coupled with the creation and deletion of temporary files, raises concerns about potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The combination of these events over multiple logs makes it more than just a one-off incident; it suggests a coordinated effort which could be harmful.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains repeated PowerShell activities searching for 'password' in sensitive file types and creating\/deleting temporary files, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first log shows cmd.exe being used with a command line that deletes some files in the temp directory. That seems suspicious because deleting files can be part of malicious activity, especially if it's trying to remove evidence. \n\nNext, there are several instances where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The logs show process creations, image loads, and even file deletions. One event shows powershell.exe accessing mscoree.dll, which is related to .NET framework, but that's normal. However, another log has a command line with \"& {}\", which looks like it might be trying to execute something else or obfuscate the actual command.\n\nThere are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used, and some of them involve file deletions in the temp directory. This could indicate an attempt to clean up files, possibly malicious ones, to avoid detection. Also, the repeated use of cmd.exe and conhost.exe might be part of a script or automated process that's trying to stay under the radar.\n\nLooking at other processes like services.exe, whoami.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe also have entries. While these are legitimate system processes, their combination with the others could raise flags. The deletion commands in cmd.exe and powershell.exe stand out because they might be covering up tracks or removing temporary files used in an attack.\n\nThe justification for considering this batch as interesting is the repeated file deletions and use of command-line tools that can be signs of malicious activity. The confidence level isn't too high (maybe 0.6) because some of these activities could also be legitimate, but the pattern suggests potential foul play.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of file deletions and suspicious process creations involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which may indicate malicious activity attempting to remove evidence or execute unauthorized commands.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nLooking at the first few entries:\n1. There's a PowerShell.exe process creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems a bit suspicious because scripts run on startup can be used for persistence.\n2. The next event shows a more detailed command line for powershell.exe: it's using findstr to search for \"pass\" in various file types like .xml, .doc, etc., and then selecting strings with the word \"password\". That looks like password harvesting activity. Definitely red flags here because this is a common technique for credential extraction.\n3. Then there are multiple entries from chrome.exe, mostly DNS queries and registry changes. Those could be benign or part of normal browsing behavior, but sometimes they can indicate malicious activities if they're accessing known bad domains or modifying system settings without user knowledge.\n\nFurther down:\n- There's an instance where whoami.exe is run with a command line that seems normal (just getting the user info), so probably not suspicious.\n- cmd.exe and schtasks.exe are used to delete scheduled tasks. The command lines show deletion of specific task names, which might be legitimate admin activity or attempts to remove persistence mechanisms. If these tasks were malicious, this would be a way to clean them up, but without knowing the original tasks' nature, it's hard to say.\n- schtasks.exe is also used to load a system DLL, which seems standard.\n\nPutting it all together, the standout points are:\n- The PowerShell script searching for passwords in various files. This activity is highly indicative of potential malicious intent because attackers often look for credentials to steal or maintain access.\n- The use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks might be trying to remove traces of previous activities, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nEven though there are some benign-looking entries from Chrome and legitimate tools like whoami.exe, the combination of PowerShell script activity and task deletion suggests possible malicious behavior. This batch shows signs that could indicate an attack or unauthorized access, making it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes suspicious activities such as a PowerShell script searching for sensitive information (passwords in various file types) and the deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's a schtasks.exe loading taskschd.dll. That seems normal since SCHTASKS is used for scheduled tasks. Next, whoami.exe runs without any unusual command line arguments—it's just checking user info, so nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen, powershell.exe accesses something but doesn't show a file path. PowerShell can be tricky because it's often used by attackers, but without seeing the actual commands run, I can't say for sure. Moving on, there's a cmd.exe command that deletes notepad.exe using WMIC. That caught my attention—using WMIC to delete processes is a common tactic in malware and scripts meant to hide activity.\n\nLooking further, another cmd.exe runs a net user \/del command, deleting an account named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting accounts can be part of privilege escalation or cleanup after malicious activities. Then there's a net.exe command deleting \"componente_comum_Admin\" which seems similar—targeting specific admin accounts.\n\nPowershell.exe appears multiple times accessing resources without clear actions, and cmd.exe is used again to delete another account \"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\". There are also several events where processes like conhost.exe set registry values. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nMultiple instances of 'Security Group Management' and 'User Account Management' in the logs suggest that user and group structures are being altered, which could indicate someone trying to elevate privileges or create backdoor accounts.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show a series of commands deleting admin accounts, using tools like cmd.exe and WMIC to execute them. Such activities might be part of an attack where an adversary is attempting to remove traces or disable certain accounts as part of their movement within the system. The repeated use of deletion commands on administrative accounts increases my concern that this could be malicious activity.\n\nWhile some events alone might not raise red flags, the combination—like deleting multiple admin accounts using cmd and net commands—is concerning. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or disrupt normal operations. The presence of both command-line tools and registry changes adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if this could be legitimate activity, such as system maintenance or script execution. But given the specific targeting of admin accounts and multiple deletion attempts, it's more likely malicious. Therefore, the batch should be classified as interesting with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of account deletions and process creations indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of system events is interesting or not. Let me look at each event one by one and see if anything stands out.\n\nThe first event shows Calculator.exe loading a DLL file called urlmon.dll. That's normal because Calculator is a standard Windows application, and it might use some system libraries for functionality.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe created a new configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool used for log collection, so creating a config file doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's PowerShell being accessed. This could be concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and lateral movement. However, in this case, it's just the ProcessAccess event without any unusual activity following it, so maybe not an issue here.\n\nWhoami.exe was executed, which is a common tool to check user information. It doesn't do anything malicious by default, so that's probably fine.\n\nThe next three events are all from Chrome: DNS queries and a network connection. Browsing activity typically triggers these events, especially with Chrome connecting to various domains and servers. Nothing unusual here.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together, none of the individual events indicate malicious behavior. They're all standard activities for typical user actions and system processes. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other signs of compromise. So this batch doesn't seem relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal user activities including process creation and standard application operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
