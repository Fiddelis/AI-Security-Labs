{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first few events:\n1. The process is 'calc.exe' with an image load task. Not too suspicious since calc is a common program.\n2. 'Calculator.exe' also loads urlmon.dll. Wait, but isn't Calculator typically part of Windows? Maybe legitimate.\n3. Then there's 'svchost.exe' setting a registry value. Svchost is a standard system process, so that seems normal.\n\nNext events involve 'whoami.exe' being executed from the command line. Whoami is usually used to get user information, but if it's run without any unusual flags, might not be suspicious. However, multiple instances of whoami could indicate something. Let me check how many times it appears—looks like it's called a few times.\n\nThen there are 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe' and 'chrome.exe' setting registry values. Both seem legitimate as they're part of Windows and Chrome processes respectively.\n\nLooking further, I spot 'powershell.exe' being accessed and also creating processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers because it's powerful. But seeing just access might not be enough—need to see if it's executing commands or scripts.\n\nThen there are cmd.exe instances with command lines that look like they're deleting processes (notepad.exe) and copying files (sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe). Deleting processes could be legitimate admin work, but replacing system files like sethc might be suspicious. Also, cmd.exe is often used in command-line attacks.\n\nThere's a 'WMIC.exe' process with a command line trying to delete notepad.exe. WMIC can be abused for remote execution and process management, which is a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows 'cmd.exe' copying sethc_backup.exe to sethc.exe. This seems like an attempt to replace system binaries, which could indicate persistence mechanisms or malware attempting to hide itself.\n\nFurther down, there's a cmd.exe command deleting a scheduled task (schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f). Deleting tasks could be part of removing traces or disrupting normal system functions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of legitimate processes being used in ways that might indicate tampering—like replacing system files and deleting processes or tasks. The use of PowerShell, cmd.exe with specific commands, and WMIC are common tools for attackers but here they seem to be performing actions that could be malicious. There's a pattern of system changes and process manipulation which might suggest an attack. However, some of these could also be accidental or legitimate admin activity.\n\nThe confidence level is around 0.8 because while there are signs that could indicate malicious activity, it's not conclusive without more context on the baseline behavior of the system.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of legitimate processes being used in potentially malicious ways, such as deleting system processes and replacing system binaries.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So I have a batch of system log events that I need to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, each line is an event with process details, winlog task, and file information. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe first few events are about powershell.exe being accessed or cmd.exe being created. Powershell is a common tool used in both legitimate tasks and malicious activities because it can execute scripts and commands. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times might raise some flags, but on its own, it's not necessarily suspicious unless there's more context.\n\nThen there are events where chrome.exe loads amsi.dll. AMI is related to Anti-Malware Scan Interface, so I'm wondering why Chrome would be loading that. Maybe it's normal for system processes, but sometimes attackers might try to hide their activities by using legitimate processes or hooks into known security components. I should keep an eye on how often this happens and the surrounding events.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is being created twice. Whoami is a standard command used to get user information, so seeing it run isn't unusual. However, if it's executed in an unexpected context or with certain parameters, it could be malicious. But without more details on its usage here, I'm not too concerned yet.\n\nThere are events where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is part of the Windows console system; sometimes it's used by legitimate applications but can also be abused for persistence. If this process is making changes to the registry repeatedly or in an unusual way, that could indicate something suspicious. But I need to see if this behavior fits within normal patterns.\n\nI notice multiple instances where powershell.exe creates files and then deletes them shortly after. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1 is created and then deleted. This kind of activity can be a red flag because attackers might create temporary scripts to test permissions or execute malicious code before deleting evidence. The fact that it's a PowerShell script is concerning, especially if the process is creating such files without legitimate reason.\n\nAdditionally, there are processes with command lines like \"powershell.exe & {}\". This looks unusual. Typically, you'd see something more specific in the command line if it's running a script or command. The ampersand might suggest chaining commands, but without knowing what comes next, this could be an attempt to hide malicious activities or to execute multiple commands in one go.\n\nLooking further down, there are entries where powershell.exe loads various DLLs and interacts with registry values. Legitimate scripts might do this for various reasons, but repeated access to system files and registry modifications by a high-privilege process like PowerShell could be an indicator of malicious behavior, especially if it's trying to establish persistence or modify security configurations.\n\nThere are also events where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the data directory. Winlogbeat is an open-source tool for collecting Windows logs, so that seems benign unless it's being used inappropriately by an attacker. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, I have to consider if this could be part of a larger attack vector.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell.exe accesses, script file creation and deletion, unusual command lines, registry modifications, loading system DLLs, repeated process creations of cmd.exe and whoami.exe. These collectively create a concerning pattern that suggests potential malicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines and the manipulation of system files and registry entries are particularly worrying signs.\n\nI'm also noticing that many events have \"None\" for the file path, which might indicate they're process-related without direct file access, but combined with other events where files are created and deleted, it's still concerning. The overall volume of powershell.exe activities stands out, especially when coupled with the script creation and deletion.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I believe these logs show a pattern that could indicate an attack or unauthorized activity. There's enough here to suggest that further investigation is warranted to rule out malicious intent or identify potential compromises.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided system log events indicates a potential security concern. The multiple instances of powershell.exe access, script file creation and deletion, unusual command lines, registry modifications, and other activities collectively point towards possible malicious behavior. These actions could be indicative of an attack attempting to hide evidence or establish persistence. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct further investigation to assess the nature of these events and ensure system integrity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Review:** Each event was examined for process details, winlog tasks, and file information.\n2. **Powershell Usage:** Noted multiple accesses and unusual command lines, suggesting potential misuse.\n3. **File Operations:** Observed the creation and deletion of a PowerShell script, which is suspicious.\n4. **Registry Modifications:** Identified registry changes by powershell.exe, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n5. **Legitimate Tools Abuse:** Considered whether tools like whoami.exe and conhost.exe are being misused.\n6. **Pattern Recognition:** Noticed recurring themes that together form a concerning pattern of potential malicious activity.\n7. **Conclusion:** Determined the need for further investigation due to the combination of suspicious events.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe provided system logs exhibit a series of events that collectively suggest potential malicious activities. Key indicators include multiple accesses of powershell.exe with unusual command lines, creation and deletion of a PowerShell script, registry modifications, and other concerning actions. These patterns warrant further investigation to determine if the system has been compromised or if an attack is occurring.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The events indicate potential malicious activity requiring further investigation.}}"}

Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is the process \"whoami.exe\" being created. That's usually just a user checking their permissions, nothing malicious in itself. Then there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of certain files. Each time, it's using if statements to see if specific .bat files exist and exiting based on that.\n\nHmm, so those commands seem like they're trying to verify whether certain scripts or files are present on the system. This could be part of a script checking its dependencies before proceeding. But I'm wondering why there are so many similar checks—maybe it's testing different locations, which might indicate some kind of persistence mechanism or file infection.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is being accessed and loaded into memory. That's normal if someone is using PowerShell, but the fact that several instances are being created with specific command lines makes me think they're part of a larger script execution. There's also an event where a file is deleted in the AppData directory—specifically, a temporary .ps1 file. Deleting such files could be an attempt to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nAnother point is that some events are marked as 'Process Create' and others as 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. This suggests that multiple parts of PowerShell's architecture are being engaged, which might not be typical for standard usage. Additionally, there's a registry value set by chrome.exe, but that seems unrelated unless it's part of a broader attack vector.\n\nThe deletion of the temporary PowerShell script file is concerning because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid detection. The repeated checks for .bat files could indicate an attempt to spread or ensure the presence of malicious scripts across different directories. Also, one command line actually creates new items and sets content in batch files, which might be planting backdoors or commands that will execute later.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell invocations with file checks, deletions, and script creations suggests a possible attack chain. This could be indicative of an adversary setting up persistence mechanisms, testing for existing malware presence, or deploying new scripts across the system. The variety of tasks logged—process creation, file access, image loading, and registry changes—paints a picture of potentially malicious activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be alarming, the cumulative behavior raises red flags. The confidence is high because several indicators point to possible malicious intent, especially the script deletions and multiple file checks across different paths.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell invocations with command lines checking for specific files, combined with file deletion and creation events, suggest potential malicious activity such as persistence or evidence cleaning.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

All the events seem related to PowerShell activities on a system.\n\nFirst, multiple instances show 'powershell.exe' being executed with command lines that create new files and set content in .bat files. This could be part of legitimate scripting, but it might also indicate malicious activity like dropping scripts for persistence or other purposes.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry modifications and image loads, which are common during script execution. However, the repeated creation of files in different directories using New-Item and Set-Content stands out as potentially suspicious behavior. This could be an attempt to create a persistence mechanism or leave backdoors.\n\nI also notice that some entries don't have specific file paths, which might mean they're part of a larger script execution without direct file access.

{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are from powershell.exe. The command lines look like they're checking for specific files using Test-Path. For example, the first event checks if \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\elemento_padrao\\..\\\\registro_logico\\estrutura_principal_script.bat\" exists and exits with 0 or 1 accordingly. This seems repetitive because each subsequent event is doing a similar check but with different file paths.\n\nLooking at these command lines, they all follow the same pattern: checking if a specific .bat file exists in a certain directory structure. The paths are changing slightly each time, maybe testing multiple locations. Since this is PowerShell, it's a common tool for both admins and attackers, so I need to be cautious here.\n\nBut why would someone run these checks? It could be legitimate admin activity, like checking if certain scripts exist before proceeding with other tasks. On the other hand, malicious actors might use such checks to verify the presence of files they want to execute or delete later.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events have different task types in winlog. For example, there's a File Delete logged and a File created event. The File Delete event has a path pointing to a PowerShell script in the user's temp folder: \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\". That could be suspicious because deleting scripts might be part of an attempt to remove evidence or prevent execution.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the data directory with a .new extension. This seems like normal behavior for log shipping tools that rotate files, so probably not malicious on its own.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process create event, which is common and usually not concerning unless it's part of privilege escalation steps.\n\nPutting this together: multiple PowerShell instances checking for various script files could indicate someone setting up an environment or perhaps testing for certain conditions. The File Delete event stands out more because deleting files can be part of data exfiltration or cleanup after malicious activity.\n\nHowever, the other events don't show any direct signs of exploitation or unauthorized access beyond these checks and deletions. It's possible that this is just automated script execution or system monitoring tasks.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the repeated PowerShell commands could be part of a larger script trying to establish persistence or check for specific conditions necessary for an attack. The deletion of a temporary PowerShell script might also be risky if it's covering tracks. But without more context, like additional events showing data breaches or unauthorized changes, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven that the majority of events are benign-looking file checks and creation\/deletion by known tools, I'm leaning towards this being NOT INTERESTING because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond possibly exploratory behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch primarily consists of repetitive PowerShell commands checking for file existence and normal log file operations, with one suspicious file deletion. However, these activities don't indicate clear malicious intent and could be legitimate system checks or automated tasks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE_LEVEL\": \"75\"\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I've been given a bunch of log events from a system, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at each event, most of them involve powershell.exe processes. That's a common tool that can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So my initial thought is that there could be something suspicious here.\n\nLet me go through each log one by one:\n\n1. The first event shows powershell.exe being executed with a command line argument. The command checks if a specific file exists in a path like \"C:\\registro_ativo\\elemento_temporario...\" and exits based on that. This kind of file check can be part of malicious activity, especially if the file is something it shouldn't expect.\n\n2. Next events are about process access, image loading, file deletion, and pipe creation. The file deletion in particular stands out—powershell.exe deleting a file from a temporary directory might indicate some cleanup after an attack or exfiltration.\n\n3. There's also an event where cmd.exe is run with a command checking if a temp file exists and exiting accordingly. This could be part of a larger script trying to execute malicious commands only under certain conditions.\n\n4. Multiple registry value sets in powershell.exe processes are logged. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, making it a red flag for potential malware.\n\n5. There are several instances where whoami.exe is executed. While this command is often used benignly to check user permissions, in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of an elevation of privilege attempt or info gathering by malware.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of process creation and file system activity involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a favorite tool for attackers because it can execute commands and scripts that have legitimate uses but can also do damage. The repeated checks on specific files and deletion actions suggest possible malicious behavior—maybe trying to run a script only if certain conditions are met or cleaning up evidence.\n\nThe multiple registry writes are concerning too, as attackers often set registry keys to ensure their malware runs at system startup or to hide their presence. Combined with the file deletions and process creations, it's creating a narrative of potential malicious activity.\n\nWhile there could be non-malicious reasons for these actions (like scripts running for system maintenance), the combination is too specific and repeated to ignore. The confidence level here isn't extremely high but significant enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command-line arguments, file deletions in temporary directories, registry modifications, and repeated whoami.exe executions suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them are related to PowerShell. The 'process' field shows 'powershell.exe' repeatedly, which is a common tool used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities. That already raises some flags because attackers often use PowerShell due to its built-in capabilities and the ability to execute scripts.\n\nNext, examining the command lines in these processes, I see several instances where PowerShell is checking if specific files exist using Test-Path. The paths mentioned like 'C:\\modulo_secundario\\pacote_padrao\\estrutura_base\\src\\unidade_secundario.cs' and others seem to be testing for the presence of .cs (C# source code) files and .ps1 scripts. This behavior could indicate that an attacker is trying to verify if certain malicious scripts or components are present on the system, possibly as part of a larger script execution or payload delivery.\n\nThe tasks in 'winlog' vary but include actions like Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, and Registry value set. The ImageLoad events loading DLLs like MpClient.dll and clr.dll might be normal, but when combined with other activities, they could signify something more nefarious, such as the execution of malicious code or lateral movement.\n\nAnother point is the repeated creation of files in different locations, including user-specific directories like 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\...' and temporary folders. This could be part of an attempt to persist on the system or to write intermediate data for further attacks.\n\nThere's also a process create event with a command line that includes checking for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is a script known for capturing keystrokes—a classic indicator of malicious activity aimed at gathering sensitive information.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a pattern of file existence checks and attempts to load various components, possibly leading up to executing a script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) that could capture user input. This combination is concerning because it suggests potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\nWhile I can't be 100% certain without more context, the volume of PowerShell activity, especially involving checks for specific files and known malicious scripts, increases my confidence that this batch is indeed worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes checking for file existence and attempting to load potentially malicious scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one to see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe is being executed with a command line that checks if a specific PowerShell script exists. If it does, exit 0; else, exit 1. That seems odd because why would a script check for the existence of another script? Maybe trying to run some malicious script but fails if it's not there.\n\nNext, powershell.exe creates a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. I'm not sure what that does, but creating files in non-standard locations might be suspicious.\n\nThen, there are several events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. That could be normal admin tasks, but it's something to watch because script execution often interacts with the registry.\n\nI see whoami.exe being run a few times. Using whoami is common for getting user info, but if it's called multiple times or in unusual contexts, it might indicate privilege escalation attempts.\n\nThere are instances where calc.exe and Calculator.exe load urlmon.dll. That seems normal since they're system processes, but sometimes malicious scripts inject code into these apps.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe deleting a file in the Temp directory related to PSScriptPolicyTest. Powershell scripts often create temporary files, so deletion might be part of cleanup, but it could also hide traces of malicious activity.\n\nMultiple events show powershell.exe running with various command lines that include ls and get-childitem commands. These are typical for listing directories, but when combined with other activities, they could indicate data exfiltration or file traversal attacks.\n\nThere's also a file creation event by winlogbeat.exe in the Downloads directory. That seems related to log shipping, so probably not malicious on its own.\n\nLooking at all these together, there are several red flags. The repeated use of powershell.exe with different commands could be part of an attack chain—initial access, lateral movement, data exfiltration. The checks for script existence and deletions might indicate attempts to remove evidence or ensure persistence. Plus, the combination of process creations and file\/registry interactions suggests potential malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, some events are common admin tasks or legitimate script executions. It's hard to be certain without more context, but given the clustering around powershell.exe and suspicious file operations, it's probably worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts, including checks for script existence, deletions, and process interactions.

PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be a red flag because it's frequently associated with malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there are two events where conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe set registry values. Conhost.exe is part of Windows Subsystem for Linux and usually not suspicious on its own. Winlogbeat.exe sounds like it could be related to log management, maybe something legitimate like the Elastic WinLogBeat agent. But both setting registry values might indicate configuration changes, which can be normal but also potentially malicious if done unexpectedly.\n\nLooking at another powershell.exe event that creates a file in a non-interactive profile directory again. This repetition makes me think there's some automated process running PowerShell multiple times, possibly trying to establish persistence or execute scripts without user interaction.\n\nThe winlogbeat event is creating a .yml file in the data folder, which seems like it could be part of setting up logging configuration. However, if this is happening in an unusual context, it might warrant closer look.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses processes. Process access can be normal but sometimes indicates privilege escalation or lateral movement. Since there are multiple such events from the same process, I'm more concerned about potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple PowerShell instances performing file operations and registry changes, combined with other processes making registry modifications. This could indicate a script running in the background, possibly attempting to create persistence mechanisms, modify configurations, or access other processes which might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while some events individually might not be suspicious, the combination and repetition suggest potential malicious behavior that requires further investigation.
