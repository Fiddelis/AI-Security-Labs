That's a red flag because creating persistent tasks can be part of lateral movement or persistence techniques in an attack.\n\nAlso, there are attempts to delete files in the temp directory, which might indicate an attempt to cover tracks by removing scripts or logs. The repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events without any process info are suspicious too—they could mean remote execution is happening, possibly undetected.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities show signs of malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence and hiding evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges to execute calc.exe on startup, deletion of temporary files, and repeated remote command executions indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the first event says that a remote command was executed. That already catches my attention because executing commands remotely can be a sign of potential malicious activity, like remote access tools or scripts being run without proper authorization. But I need to look at all the events together to understand the context better.\n\nThe second event is from PowerShell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. I know that PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and also by attackers because it's powerful and can do a lot, including executing commands and handling files. The fact that it's creating a file here might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something suspicious.\n\nThe third event again involves PowerShell.exe setting a registry value. Registry modifications are common in malicious activities to maintain persistence or change system configurations. Attackers often use registry keys to ensure their programs run at startup or to hide their tracks. So this is another red flag.\n\nNext, conhost.exe sets a registry value as well. Conhost is typically related to console windows, so it's usually not malicious on its own. However, if it's modifying the registry without a clear reason, that might be concerning, especially since other processes are also doing similar things.\n\nThe fifth event shows chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. AMI? Wait, no—AMSI is Anti-Malware Scan Interface, so this could relate to security features. But sometimes malicious processes try to load legitimate modules to hide their tracks or avoid detection. Or maybe it's just normal operation, as Chrome might interact with system components.\n\nThe sixth event again has chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems odd because browsers typically don't modify the registry often. Especially when combined with other events from powershell and conhost, this could indicate some kind of coordinated activity across different processes.\n\nThe seventh event is another DNS query from chrome.exe. DNS queries are pretty common and can be part of normal browsing activity. But if it's paired with other suspicious actions, it might be worth looking into for signs of C2 (Command and Control) communication or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the last two events: powershell.exe creating another file in the Downloads folder named objeto_auxiliar.txt. Creating files is common, but the naming doesn't immediately seem suspicious. However, considering that there are multiple actions from PowerShell, including file creation and registry modifications, it adds up to a pattern of potentially malicious behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch includes activities like remote command execution, multiple processes (including powershell.exe) modifying the registry, creating files in user directories, and unexpected actions from chrome.exe. These could be indicators of malicious activity such as:\n\n1. **Persistence Mechanisms**: Registry modifications are often used by malware to ensure it runs at system startup.\n2. **File Creation**: Creating files in user directories might be part of data collection or establishing a presence on the system.\n3. **Process Execution and Interaction**: Multiple processes interacting with each other (powershell.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe) could indicate script execution or command chaining, which is common in attack scripts.\n4. **DLL Injection\/Loading**: The attempt to load amsi.dll might be an evasion technique or part of malicious behavior.\n\nThe remote command execution stands out as a significant indicator because it suggests unauthorized access or control over the system. While individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination of these activities across different processes and types (file, registry, network) raises concern about potential malicious intent.\n\nI'm also considering if this could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or user activity. However, the use of multiple techniques (registry changes, file creation in non-standard locations like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive) makes it less likely to be benign. Additionally, the involvement of PowerShell.exe is a common vector for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ability to execute commands.\n\nTherefore, the batch as a whole appears to exhibit behavior that would warrant further investigation. The confidence level is high because multiple red flags are present across different process types and actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including remote command execution, registry modifications, and file creations by PowerShell.exe and other processes, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
