{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is run normally. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nSecond event stands out. It's powershell.exe being executed with some command line arguments that include commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. These are legitimate PowerShell commands but often used in scripts for system information gathering or privilege escalation. The fact that it's called multiple times (events 8,9,10) with the same command is concerning because repeated execution could be part of a script trying to avoid detection.\n\nThird through seventh events: Powershell loading various DLLs and images. This is normal during PowerShell execution but combined with the previous events, it might indicate malicious activity like loading components for a payload or script execution.\n\nEvent 7: Powershell.exe creates a file in the Temp directory, specifically __PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1. Temporary files created by scripts can be part of legitimate operations, but also often used by malware to store malicious scripts temporarily before executing them. The fact that it's deleted right after (event 8) raises suspicions—malware might delete traces to avoid detection.\n\nEvents 9-12: More Process Create events for net.exe and net1.exe, which are standard network commands. However, the repeated use of these tools could indicate someone trying different ways to access or manage networks, possibly probing for vulnerabilities.\n\nLooking at all together, there's a pattern of creating temporary files in Temp directory, loading multiple image DLLs (possibly obfuscating), executing powershell scripts with user enumeration commands, and deleting the created file. This sequence is often seen in attack chains—reconnaissance, lateral movement, persistence.\n\nThe repeated Process Creates and Provider\/Engine Lifecycle events suggest a script or process that's being monitored or executed multiple times, which could be an indicator of malicious activity trying to run at different intervals or under different user contexts.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch shows potential signs of malicious behavior. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards possible exploitation, especially the use of PowerShell for script execution and file creation\/deletion in Temp.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated powershell.exe executions with potential malicious command lines, temporary file creation, and deletions indicative of script execution. The combination suggests possible adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst two lines: They're both showing a task related to \"Security Group Management.\" That might be normal admin stuff, like user group changes. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nNext line has cmdkey.exe being executed with the \/list argument. I know cmdkey is used for managing stored credentials. The \/list command shows saved passwords, which could be a security risk if unauthorized access happens. This could indicate someone trying to get credentials.\n\nThen there are several powershell.exe entries. Powershell can do a lot, both good and bad. Some tasks include accessing processes, creating files, and setting registry values. Creating files in user-specific locations (like Downloads or AppData) might be normal, but it's worth checking what those files contain. The RegistryEvent could mean they're modifying system settings, which is common for scripts but also something attackers might do.\n\nOne event shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is an agent used to collect logs, so that seems benign unless there's something odd about how it's being used here.\n\nThere's also calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's a standard Windows DLL, so not suspicious on its own, but sometimes attackers use legitimate tools for malicious activities, so context matters.\n\nLastly, whoami.exe is run. This command usually shows user information and is often used by scripts or tools to gather basic system info. Alone, it's not bad, but combined with other actions might be part of a larger script.\n\nPutting it all together: The cmdkey.exe use stands out because it directly interacts with credentials. Powershell's activity could be malicious if those scripts are doing something harmful like persistence or data exfiltration. Registry changes are another red flag as attackers often modify the registry to hide their tracks or create persistence mechanisms. Multiple powershell executions and file creations might indicate script execution, possibly from a compromised account.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being interesting because of cmdkey.exe and the potential misuse of powershell along with registry modifications, which could be signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows unusual process creations and file operations, including potential credential dumping via cmdkey.exe and suspicious PowerShell activities that may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
