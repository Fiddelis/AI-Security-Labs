Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is whoami.exe being run. That seems pretty normal; it's a standard command used to show user information. Not suspicious in itself.\n\nNext, there's cmd.exe being executed with some arguments that look like they're trying to create a service using sc create. The command line has \"sc create win32times binPath= \\\"cmd \/c start c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1\\\"\". Wait, that looks odd because the script path is NonExistingScript.ps1. Maybe it's trying to execute a non-existent script, which could be a red flag. Creating a service with a script that doesn't exist might indicate an attempt to run malicious code.\n\nThen there's another sc.exe event creating win32times again but pointing to a different script: c:\\\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, NonExistingScript.ps1 is the target. This repetition makes me think someone is trying multiple ways to execute scripts using these service creation commands. It could be an attempt to bypass detection or persistence.\n\nLooking further, there are events from services.exe and svchost.exe modifying registry values. Services.exe is legitimate, but combined with the previous sc create calls, it might be part of creating or managing a new service. Svchost.exe is also commonly used by malware because it's a legitimate Windows process, so any changes to its registry entries could be suspicious.\n\nThe powershell.exe events are accessed multiple times. Since PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, repeated accesses without clear purpose might warrant attention. The process access rule being triggered means the system is monitoring file handles or memory mappings of the PowerShell process.\n\nThere's a notepad.exe accessing registry values too. Notepad is usually benign, but if it's modifying sensitive registry keys, that could be concerning. However, without more context on what specific keys are being accessed, it's hard to say.\n\nI notice cmd.exe and chrome.exe also have events with ImageLoad or Registry value changes. Chrome loading amsi.dll might be normal as part of its operation since Anti-Malware Scan Interface is used for scanning scripts. The MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender is also standard. So those might not be suspicious on their own.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there are multiple attempts to create services with non-existent script paths and repeated use of sc.exe and cmd.exe for similar commands. This could indicate someone trying to establish persistence or deploy malware using scheduled tasks or services that don't exist, which is a common tactic in attacks. The combination of these events makes me think there's potential malicious activity here.\n\nI'm also considering the confidence level. While individual events might not be enough, together they form a pattern that suggests possible compromise. However, without seeing more context like the exact timestamps or other related events, I can't be 100% certain. But given the multiple attempts and non-existent script paths, my confidence is high but not absolute.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of attempting to create services with non-existent scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
