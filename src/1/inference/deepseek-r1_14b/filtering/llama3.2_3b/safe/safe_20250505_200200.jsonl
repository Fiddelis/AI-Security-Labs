{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are two events where `winlogbeat.exe` creates a file: one is the creation of `.winlogbeat.yml.new`. This seems normal because winlogbeat is an agent that collects logs, so it might be updating its configuration or data files.\n\nNext, I see `ssh.exe` creating a file at `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\.ssh\\known_hosts`. SSH clients usually store known host keys here for secure connections. That's standard behavior when using SSH, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from `powershell.exe` related to loading images: `mscoree.dll` and `mscorlib.ni.dll`. These are legitimate system files that PowerShell might load when running scripts or commands. No red flags here.\n\nThere's an event where `powershell.exe` deletes a file in the Temp directory: `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`. This could be part of PowerShell's policy testing, which is a normal process to ensure scripts comply with execution policies.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to represent standard operations: log agent updates, SSH key storage, and PowerShell activities like loading modules or cleaning up temporary files. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies that would warrant further investigation. The confidence level in this being non-interesting is high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal log file operations and standard PowerShell activity without indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
