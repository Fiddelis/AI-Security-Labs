The \"winlog\" indicates that it's a file creation event under the rule FileCreate. \n\nLooking at the \"file\" paths, they all point to the same directory but have different filenames. These filenames are long hexadecimal strings, which makes me think they're unique identifiers or some form of tracking tokens.\n\nI know that Office applications sometimes use Solution Packages for add-ins and resources. The path includes \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\", suggesting these might be cached files for an Office add-in, possibly something like Copilot as mentioned in the filenames. \n\nThe repetition of similar events with slightly different file names could indicate a legitimate process, like downloading multiple resources or updating cached files. SDXHelper.exe is likely part of Microsoft's Office setup, handling such tasks.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known for this activity. A quick search tells me it's related to managing Office solutions and updates. So these file creation events are probably normal as the system caches necessary resources.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit cautious because multiple identical events might indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to write many files quickly or in a loop.

The fact that they're all from \"SDXHelper.exe\" makes me think this is part of legitimate Office operations because Microsoft Office uses such helper processes for various tasks, including handling offline content or package resources. \n\nThe duplication of some file entries could be normal if the system is retrying writes or if multiple instances are creating similar files.

No unusual processes, no access to restricted areas, and all the files seem related to Office components, which are expected in an Office environment. There's no evidence of file creation times being suspiciously close or any anomalies in the file paths that might suggest they're trying to hide something.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor log files for any unexpected behavior, in this case, the events don't raise any red flags.

The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\" across all events. The task in each case is a \"File created\" event triggered by a rule named \"FileCreate\". The files being created are located in specific paths under the user's AppData directory, within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they seem to be variations of JavaScript files related to vendors and shared resources. For example, paths like \"vendors~researchworkspace.js\" or \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" suggest these are part of some package or resource that's being loaded by the application.\n\nNow, considering that all events involve the same process name creating multiple files in a structured manner, it seems like this could be part of a legitimate software operation. Microsoft Office often uses such helper processes to manage resources, especially for features like Copilot which require background processing. The repeated file creation might be part of initializing these features or updating their resources.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's anything unusual about the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\". A quick mental note tells me that this isn't a commonly known malicious process, but I'm not entirely certain without checking. Since all events are from the same user and involve standard file operations within known application directories, it doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\nAnother point is that the number of files being created seems quite high—there are multiple entries with different hashes or identifiers in their filenames. This could be normal if the application is loading various resources, but it might also indicate something more insidious like dropped files from a malicious payload. However, given the context and process name, it's more likely legitimate.\n\nI should also think about how these events would look in typical system logs. Legitimate applications often log file creation events when initializing or updating components.

Each event is a JSON object, and there are multiple lines in the JSONL format. My task is to analyze all these events together to see if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each event represents. The 'process' field shows that the same executable, SDXHelper.exe, is involved in every event. That suggests it's a consistent process creating files. The 'winlog' indicates that the task being logged is a file creation event, specifically when a new file is created on the system.\n\nLooking at the 'file' paths, they all point to the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<some guid>\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames vary but follow a pattern like excel-copilot-strings followed by different hashes. This seems systematic—each event is creating a new file with a unique name in the same directory.\n\nNow, considering SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but given that it's associated with Microsoft Office Solution Packages and OfflineFiles, it might be part of legitimate software operations. For example, some office applications or plugins might create temporary or cache files to improve performance or for offline functionality.\n\nThe fact that multiple files are being created sequentially could be normal behavior if this is related to an application updating its resources or caching data. The repetition of the process name and similar file paths across all events doesn't raise any immediate red flags, as it's common for applications to create several temporary or configuration files during runtime or setup.\n\nI should also consider whether such activity is typical. If SDXHelper.exe is part of a known software component, especially one related to Microsoft Office, then the creation of these files might be expected and not malicious. However, if this process isn't commonly associated with such file operations, that could warrant further investigation.\n\nAnother angle is the frequency of these events. If several files are created in quick succession, it's possible they're part of a bulk operation or an update. The presence of unique filenames suggests each might be a resource needed by the application, which wouldn't typically indicate malicious activity unless there's something suspicious about the content of those files.\n\nI should check if these hashes correspond to known legitimate resources or if any are flagged as malicious. Without additional context on what these specific files contain, it's hard to say definitively. But based solely on the file paths and process name, they don't appear to be outliers in a typical system environment.\n\nMoreover, all events involve the same task type—file creation—which isn't inherently suspicious. It would be concerning if there were other types of activities like deletions, modifications without reason, or accesses that shouldn't happen from this process.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to verify the legitimacy of processes and their actions, especially when dealing with file operations, the evidence here doesn't point towards malicious behavior.

So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here. Each event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task in each case is \"File created\", and they all reference similar file paths.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office. It's part of the Office Solution Packages, which means it's used for adding functionality like templates or additional features to Office. These events are showing that multiple files are being created in an OfflineFiles directory under the PackageResources folder. The filenames all have a similar pattern but different hashes, indicating they might be different versions or updates.\n\nNow, considering these are all file creation events by a legitimate Microsoft process, my initial thought is that this isn't suspicious. Office often creates temporary or cached files during updates or when adding new features. It's normal for such processes to generate multiple files as part of their operation.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any reason to be cautious here. Sometimes, malicious actors might use legitimate process names to hide their activities. However, in this case, the path structure seems consistent with how Office handles its package resources. The repetition is probably due to an update or cache refresh rather than something nefarious.\n\nAnother angle: could these files being created indicate some kind of lateral movement or data exfiltration? Well, since they're all under a known Microsoft directory and named as strings.min followed by hashes, it doesn't seem like that's happening here. It looks more like standard operations.\n\nI'm also thinking about how many events there are—fifteen in total, each creating a different file. That seems a bit on the higher side, but again, if this is part of an update or a routine process, it might be normal. I don't see any signs of unusual access times or locations that would raise red flags.\n\nIn terms of the user context, all these files are under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local...\", which is a typical location for application data. No elevated privileges seem to be involved here; it's just a regular user process.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process creating several files in a known Microsoft directory with standard naming conventions. Nothing seems off about the source or the actions taken. It looks like legitimate activity related to Office updates or feature additions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe, a known Microsoft Office process, which is part of legitimate operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format and I need to determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is always related to a file being created, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". Each event has a file path that points to different JavaScript files within the Office Solution Packages directory in the user's AppData folder. \n\nI notice that there are multiple entries with varying hashes in the filenames, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_cd6ad91b9df8dd57b510ac0fb74ea585.js and similar. This suggests that these are different versions or instances of files being created.\n\nNow, considering what I know: \"SDXHelper.exe\" is often associated with malicious activities. It's a known backdoor used in cyberattacks, allowing remote access to compromised systems. The fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files could be part of its payload delivery or persistence mechanism. These JS files might contain additional malicious code or be used for lateral movement within the network.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events—each one is a file creation by the same process—could indicate an ongoing or repeated activity, which might be a sign of persistent malware trying to establish a presence or spread further.\n\nI also see that all these files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory under PackageResources. This makes me think about how Office packages handle local resources, but the combination with SDXHelper.exe raises suspicion. Typically, legitimate processes wouldn't create so many varied JS files unless it's part of their normal operation, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nSo, putting this together: the same malicious process creating numerous files could indicate an active infection or attack. Each file might be a component of the attacker's tools on the system. This pattern is concerning because it suggests that the malware is either dropping multiple payloads or establishing multiple points of persistence.\n\nTherefore, I classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because it likely indicates malicious activity by the known SDXHelper backdoor creating numerous files. My confidence in this classification is high, around 0.95, since the process and file creation pattern strongly align with known malware behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, a known malicious process, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events provided. Each event is a JSON object representing some activity on the system. The first thing I notice is that all these events are coming from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests that whatever is happening is related to this specific application or service.\n\nLooking more closely at each event, they all have the task labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, it seems like the system is generating these logs whenever a new file is created. The files are located in the path \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\" followed by different filenames. Each filename has a base name like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" with varying hashes, such as \"_6b1ebf1d895050f889bf41a5afb5ab88.js\".\n\nI'm thinking about what this might mean. SDXHelper.exe is likely part of Microsoft Office since the path includes \"Microsoft\\\\Office\". So, it's probably an update or helper tool for Office. The fact that multiple files are being created with different hashes suggests that these could be temporary files or updates being downloaded and saved.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Since all events are related to the same process creating several JavaScript files, it might seem normal at first glance. However, I should consider whether the number of file creations is unusual or if the paths indicate potential malicious activity.\n\nOne red flag could be the number of identical entries. Some filenames appear twice, like \"6f9b8b3b4869f511c67390730eeabfbb.js\" and others. This repetition might not be suspicious on its own, but it's worth noting. Another consideration is whether the hash values of these files are known to be malicious or associated with any threats.\n\nGiven that these files are under the \"OfflineFiles\" directory within the Office package, they're likely part of the Office suite's functionality. Offline Files would make sense for caching content so that it can be accessed without an internet connection. Therefore, creating multiple JavaScript files in this context could be normal during updates or installations.\n\nI also think about whether these file creations are happening at a time when other unusual activities occurred on the system. Since I don't have additional logs or context, I'm limited to analyzing just this batch. However, if these were part of a larger sequence of events with known malicious patterns, it could be more concerning.\n\nConsidering all this, while the activity is related to a legitimate process (Microsoft Office), the number of files created and their repetitive nature might warrant closer examination. But without evidence linking them to malicious behavior, I'm leaning towards it not being particularly suspicious on its own.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to Microsoft Office's offline files being created by a legitimate process, indicating normal operation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}

So, first, I'll go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the logs, they all have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because it's creating multiple files in quick succession. Each event shows that this process is creating a new file, specifically JavaScript files located under a Microsoft Office directory. The paths are pretty long and include various hashes or identifiers in their names.\n\nI'm wondering why this process is generating so many files. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar—I think it's part of the Microsoft Office suite, possibly related to updates or package resources. But creating multiple JS files could be normal for software updates, especially if they're cache files or parts of a larger script.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned because there are a lot of identical file paths and names repeated multiple times. This repetition might indicate something suspicious, like the process writing multiple copies or trying to write files in a way that's not typical. Malware often creates many files quickly or uses legitimate processes for malicious activities.\n\nOn the other hand, if this is part of Office's normal operation, especially with updates or package installations, these could just be temporary or cached files being written. It's possible that SDXHelper.exe is handling offline content for the AI Copilot feature mentioned in the file paths, which doesn't seem inherently malicious.\n\nI should also consider whether there are other indicators of compromise. Since all events are from the same process and involve file creation, it's hard to say if this alone is suspicious without more context. Maybe I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is known for such behavior or if it's commonly associated with attacks.\n\nGiven that each event is a separate JSON object but they're all very similar, I'm leaning towards it being part of legitimate Office operations, especially since the file paths include \"SolutionPackages\" and \"OfflineFiles,\" which sounds like standard setup for offline access features. But the number of files created in a short time might still be worth investigating to ensure nothing's amiss.\n\nSo, my initial thought is that while it's unusual to have so many identical events, it might just be how Office handles its package resources during updates or installations. However, without more context or additional logs showing other suspicious activities, I'm not entirely sure.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe appear to be part of normal Microsoft Office operations, possibly related to package resource updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of log events to analyze. Let me take a closer look at them.\n\nEach event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The process name in all these logs is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across all entries, which suggests it's the same process performing multiple actions. The task mentioned in each case is \"File created\", so this process is creating files repeatedly.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to locations within the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Specifically, the paths are structured like:\n\"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\<some GUID>\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\<file name>.js\"\n\nThe filenames vary but follow a pattern with \"word-copilot.min\" and \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\", followed by various hashes or identifiers. Each of these files is being created multiple times—some appear twice, others more.\n\nNow, considering the nature of these events: they all come from the same process creating JavaScript files in an Office-related directory. This seems like normal behavior if this SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office's setup or updates. The repeated creation could be related to how Office handles package resources, maybe during installation, update, or cache refresh.\n\nI don't see any immediately suspicious indicators here. No signs of unusual file names, access to restricted areas, or other red flags typically associated with malicious activities. The process is writing files in a known user directory for Office packages.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are multiple identical events could indicate something off if it's beyond typical behavior. Maybe this process is running too many times or creating too many files, which might suggest an issue like a loop or plugin causing instability. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events appear to be part of normal Office operations. The confidence is high since there are no overt signs of malicious activity, but slightly tempered by the number of repeated events which might warrant closer monitoring in some contexts.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events from SDXHelper.exe within known Microsoft Office directories, likely part of normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/llama3.2_3b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of 12 events, all involving the creation of files by SDXHelper.exe. Each event has a \"winlog\" task indicating that a file was created under the rule \"FileCreate\". The paths point to various .js files located in different package directories within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages folder.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that these are standard log entries from Windows tracking file creation events. SDXHelper.exe is an executable often associated with legitimate software updates or system tools, so it's not inherently malicious. The fact that multiple files are being created by the same process might seem a bit concerning at first glance, but in this context, it seems like part of normal operations.\n\nLooking deeper into the file paths, they all reside under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\", which is a common location for user-specific application data. The specific subdirectories are SolutionPackages, which I know is where Office stores its add-ins and solution packages. Each package has a unique GUID-like identifier, such as \"8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c\" and \"82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\". These GUIDs are typical for package identification, so it's unlikely they're malicious in nature.\n\nThe filenames end with .js, which stands for JavaScript files. While some malware does use JS files, the context here is within Office's OfflineFiles directory. This usually contains static content like scripts and strings used by add-ins or features. The repeated creation of these files might be part of an update process where the application replaces old files with new ones.\n\nAnother point to consider is that all events share the same \"SDXHelper.exe\" process name, which suggests a consistent source for file creation. If there were malicious activities, I'd expect varied process names or indicators of compromise like unusual paths or access patterns. Here, everything aligns with legitimate Office operations.\n\nI also think about the user's environment. If this user is running Microsoft Office and has installed various add-ins or features, it's normal for these files to be present. The creation events might happen during an update or installation phase of new features, which is a common occurrence in software.\n\nConsidering the frequency, 12 file creations in one batch might seem high, but when looking at individual timestamps (if provided), they could span minutes or hours. However, without more context on timing and intervals, it's hard to say if this volume is unusual beyond standard operations.\n\nIn summary, each event individually doesn't raise red flags. The process is legitimate, the files are within expected locations for Office data, and the activity aligns with normal software behavior. Unless there's additional context indicating otherwise, like multiple failed attempts or access from unauthorized sources, this batch doesn't warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in normal Microsoft Office directories, which is typical for legitimate operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
