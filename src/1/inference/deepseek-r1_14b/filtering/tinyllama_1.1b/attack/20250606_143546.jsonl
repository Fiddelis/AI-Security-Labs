Let me break down each event.\n\nThe first two events show powershell.exe being used with some commands. The command line is obfuscated but seems to be creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path. This might be a red flag because using PowerShell for such operations can be common in attacks, especially if it's installing services.\n\nThen, there are multiple events where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' and the file path points to C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. This script is being executed many times, which could indicate something suspicious like a script drop or repeated execution for persistence.\n\nAdditionally, one event mentions 'Special Logon', which often relates to user logons with specific privileges, possibly indicating an escalation attempt. Another event is about 'Security Group Management', which might involve modifying group policies or permissions—another area of interest if done unexpectedly.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows a combination of events that suggest potential malicious activity: creating services via PowerShell, executing scripts remotely multiple times, and activities related to user logons and security groups. These could be indicators of an attack, such as service creation for persistence, script execution for payload delivery, and privilege escalation or lateral movement.\n\nHowever, I should consider if these actions are part of legitimate operations. The repeated remote command executions might be normal in some environments, but the specific script path and the combination with other events make me lean towards this being suspicious. \n\nGiven all these points, I classify this batch as INTERESTING because it exhibits multiple potential attack vectors without clear evidence of being legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of remote command execution and service creation using PowerShell, which could indicate malicious activity such as persistence or payload delivery. Additionally, the repeated access to specific files may suggest an ongoing exploit attempt.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries from svchost.exe setting registry values and creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That seems normal because svchost is a legitimate Windows process often used by services. But why are there multiple such events? Maybe it's part of system updates or something like that.\n\nLooking further, there are file creations under different paths. For example, Install\\AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe and some other files in the Download folder. These might be parts of a software update or patch process. I don't see any red flags here yet.\n\nThen, MpSigStub.exe is involved in creating files related to Windows Defender. That's expected since it's part of the antivirus software. The file paths seem legitimate, so no cause for concern there.\n\nSetup.exe is creating files under Microsoft Edge Core, which makes sense if an update or new version is being installed. Again, nothing unusual here.\n\nRuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value might be related to user runtime permissions or similar system functions. That's standard behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the powershell.exe events: there are process accesses and image loads. I see whoami.exe was run as well. Powershell can do a lot of things, both legitimate and malicious. But in this batch, it's mostly loading DLLs and accessing processes, which could be normal for scripts or system tasks.\n\nThe combination here seems to indicate regular system activity—updates, service executions, file creations by trusted processes. No signs of exploited vulnerabilities, unfamiliar file paths, or unusual access patterns that would raise a red flag. \n\nI don't see any high-confidence indicators of compromise like known malicious process names, unexpected registry modifications, or network connections. The events are all within the realm of normal system operations.\n\nSo, considering everything together, while each individual event might look suspicious on its own, the batch as a whole doesn't present an obvious threat. Therefore, it's probably not interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activity, including svchost.exe performing registry operations and file creations associated with updates, MpSigStub.exe handling antivirus-related files, and powershell.exe loading modules for legitimate processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe loading various DLL files and creating pipes. Powershell is a common tool but can also be used maliciously, so that's something to note. The repeated ImageLoad events might indicate some form of module injection or script execution.\n\nThen there are services.exe processes modifying registry values three times. That could be normal for system services, but it's worth checking what exactly is being set and if those changes are legitimate.\n\nI see a tarefa_logico.exe loading the same clrjit.dll as powershell, which might mean they're part of the same process or using similar libraries. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event where 'None' processes create files or access paths. The file path mentioned is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1. PowerShell scripts are common in attacks, so this could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe command lines show powershell.exe executing scripts that import modules and perform actions like Invoke-entrada_principal. Those commands aren't standard, which raises red flags. The mention of OutputDirectory pointing to $env:Temp suggests they're trying to write files there, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration.\n\nThen, multiple events show creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" using tarefa_logico.exe as the binary path. Creating new services can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious code to run on boot.\n\nThe high number of similar events—like repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks and the same command lines—indicates a potential automated or script-driven process, which is often seen in attacks to avoid detection by varying execution points.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe is being used to execute arbitrary scripts, services are being modified, new malicious services are created, and files are written to temp directories. These activities are indicative of possible unauthorized access, malware installation, or persistence techniques. The consistent use of specific file paths and command structures suggests a coordinated attack rather than normal system behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts, registry modifications by services.exe, creation of new services with non-standard names, and execution of potentially malicious scripts from specific file paths indicate possible unauthorized access or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. I'll go through each event step by step and see what patterns emerge.\n\nStarting with the first few events, I notice that powershell.exe is being used multiple times. That's notable because PowerShell can be a tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. The events show various tasks like Registry value set, Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when combined with other behaviors, they might raise flags.\n\nLooking at the file paths associated with powershell.exe, there's a temporary file being created and then deleted: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1. Temporary files are often used by scripts to test policies or execute code, which could be part of malicious activity like persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.\n\nNext, I see several Registry value sets from processes like HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe. These are common system processes, but changes in the registry can indicate configuration changes by malware for persistence or to alter system behavior.\n\nsvchost.exe is involved in creating files within the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. This is a known location used by Windows Update, so while it's normal for updates, the fact that svchost.exe is creating multiple files here might suggest something unusual, especially if these files are being created outside of expected update cycles.\n\nThe combination of powershell.exe performing multiple actions and other system processes modifying registry entries and downloading files could indicate a broader campaign. It's possible that an attacker is using legitimate tools in a way that blends in with normal activity but is actually deploying malicious scripts or altering system configurations to maintain access.\n\nAlso, the file creation events under different directories (like AppData and Windows\\PowerShell) by powershell.exe might be part of script execution or data collection activities. The deletion of the temporary PowerShell script could be an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nTaking all these points into account, the batch shows multiple indicators that could point towards malicious activity, including the use of PowerShell for file operations, registry modifications by various processes, and unusual file creation\/deletion patterns. These collectively suggest potential compromise or attack activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe performing suspicious actions, including creating and deleting temporary files, loading images, and registry modifications. Additionally, svchost.exe is involved in creating files within the SoftwareDistribution directory, which could indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let's see what each one is about.\n\nThe first event has process as \"None\", which might mean it's a Windows event rather than a specific application. The winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That sounds suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of unauthorized access or malicious activity. Also, the file path mentioned is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". I know that .ps1 files are PowerShell scripts, which can definitely be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The fact that it's in a directory named something like \" registro secundario\" or \"auxiliary component\" doesn't immediately ring a bell as a standard system directory, so that could be concerning.\n\nLooking at the second event, it's almost identical to the first one: same task of executing a remote command and the same file path. Repeating the same action might indicate an attempt to run this script multiple times, which isn't usual unless it's part of a legitimate process. But given the nature of the task and the file involved, repeating could be a red flag for automated malicious activity.\n\nThe third event again has \"Execute a Remote Command\" in winlog, but the task is listed as \"Windows Update Agent\". That seems a bit conflicting because I thought Windows Update Agent typically handles updates automatically. But if it's executing a remote command, maybe it's attempting to download or run something outside its usual scope. The file path here is None, so no associated file, which might mean it's just the command execution without any files involved.\n\nPutting all three together: two events with the same script execution and one that also involves a remote command but under a different task. The repeated use of \"Execute a Remote Command\" catches my attention because attackers often use such commands to execute malicious scripts or payloads. Also, PowerShell scripts are commonly used for attacks due to their flexibility and ability to perform tasks silently.\n\nI'm wondering if these events could be part of an attempt to deploy malware or carry out some form of unauthorized system changes. The file path in the first two events seems non-standard, which makes me think it's not a default Windows script. Maybe an attacker is trying to run this script multiple times to ensure it's executed, perhaps after gaining initial access.\n\nAnother angle is whether these could be false positives or legitimate scripts. Sometimes, system updates or certain software might trigger such commands. But given the combination of remote execution and specific file paths, it seems less likely to be a false positive. The repetition also suggests something more deliberate than a one-off event.\n\nI should consider the confidence level. While each individual event could be borderline, together they form a pattern that's concerning. However, without more context or additional events showing further malicious behavior (like network connections or changes in system permissions), it's not a certainty. But given the nature of the tasks and file associations, there's enough here to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show attempts to execute remote commands involving a PowerShell script, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
