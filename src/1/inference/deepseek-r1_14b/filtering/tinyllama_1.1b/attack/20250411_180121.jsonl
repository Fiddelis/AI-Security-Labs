{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of logs and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most events involve powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. But sometimes it's just legitimate use, so I need to see the context.\n\nLooking at the tasks: there are a lot of 'Registry value set', which could indicate persistence mechanisms. Malware often sets registry entries to run on startup. Also, 'Image loaded' events loading .dll files might be trying to inject code or load malicious libraries.\n\nThere's a file created in C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a PowerShell script test file. Then it gets deleted. This could be an attempt to execute the script and then clean up evidence. That's concerning behavior.\n\nAnother point is multiple 'Process accessed' events on powershell.exe. Attackers might access other processes to inject code or escalate privileges.\n\nThere's also a pipe created by both chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which might be used for inter-process communication. This could be part of a larger attack chain, like command and control communication.\n\nHowever, some logs show legitimate activities, like loading framework DLLs that PowerShell needs. But the combination of registry changes, file creation\/deletion in temp folders, and multiple process accesses leans towards malicious intent.\n\nSo overall, the batch shows suspicious behavior that could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe events with suspicious activities including registry modifications, file creation\/deletion, and loading of DLLs. These actions may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe and powershell.exe. Chrome is doing network connections and DNS queries, which is normal for a browser. But then I see powershell.exe doing registry changes, loading various DLLs, and creating files in the user's temp directory. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used maliciously.\n\nLooking deeper, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is downloading files from GitHub repositories using WebClient.DownloadFile(). The URLs point to raw.githubusercontent.com with paths like LICENSE.txt. This seems suspicious because it's fetching content that might be part of a script or payload. Repeated downloads from different branches and modules (like modulo_temporario, estrutura_temporario) could indicate an attempt to gather components for malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events in the temp directory with names like __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1. This suggests that a PowerShell script is being written and executed, which aligns with the command-line arguments showing script execution from downloaded files. The use of multiple temporary files might be to avoid detection or to execute malicious code in stages.\n\nThe fact that these events are spread across several lines indicates persistent activity, possibly establishing persistence mechanisms or dropping additional payloads. Combining all this, it looks like a potential script is being executed after downloading components, which could be harmful.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including repeated file downloads from GitHub via PowerShell and creation of temporary files indicative of malicious scripts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is running with command lines that look empty or just \"& {}\". This might indicate some kind of obfuscation or attempt to hide the actual command being executed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I need to be cautious here.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are several Registry value sets, Process accesses, Image loads, File creations, and deletions. The file operations include creating a temp PS script, which was then deleted shortly after. This behavior could be part of testing permissions or persistence mechanisms. Malware often creates temporary files to execute scripts or store data.\n\nThere's also an event where cmd.exe is run with \"\/c\", which typically means it will execute the command and then terminate. The command line here seems empty, but sometimes that can mean redirecting output or other things, so it's worth noting.\n\nAnother point is the use of conhost.exe and whoami.exe. Conhost is often used by PowerShell to host console applications, so this isn't unusual, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger script execution.\n\nThe FileDeleteDetected event for the temp PS script suggests that something was written there and then removed quickly. This might be an attempt to avoid leaving traces on disk. It's a common tactic in malware to clean up after themselves.\n\nConsidering all these together: multiple powershell processes, file operations in Temp directory, registry modifications, deletion of a temporary scriptâ€”these patterns could indicate malicious activity like testing for persistence, dropping files, or executing commands that need cleanup.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the combination of events seems to align with possible attack behavior. The confidence isn't super high but significant enough given the indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities, including file creation\/deletion in temp directory and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I'm given a bunch of JSONL events and need to determine if the batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n- The process field shows powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub into temp directories. That catches my attention because PowerShell scripts can be used maliciously, and downloading files could mean they're trying to execute something.\n  \nNext events are about winlogbeat.exe creating a file with a specific path. It's doing this multiple times. I know that the .winlogbeat.yml.new file is part of the configuration for the winlogbeat service, so maybe it's just setting up logging correctly. However, seeing the same action repeated three times might be normal during setup but could also indicate some script is running repeatedly.\n\nThen there are events where various processes like powershell.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, etc., are modifying the registry (RegistryEvent task). Registry modifications can be a red flag because attackers often set or delete registry keys to maintain persistence. Also, seeing multiple different processes doing this might be suspicious.\n\nAnother event shows calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. That's interesting because calc.exe is commonly used in payloads, and loading specific DLLs could be part of malicious activities like downloading files or injecting code.\n\nThen there are process accesses for powershell.exe and svchost.exe. Accessing processes can be normal, but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate something more.\n\nLooking further down:\n- schtasks.exe is used to delete a task 'spawn'. Task deletion could be part of cleaning up traces or preventing analysis.\n- whoami.exe execution is common for gathering system info, which attackers often do.\n- cmd.exe is running commands to delete registry entries related to Run keys. Removing entries from the Run key can indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms that execute on startup.\n\nThe last few events show powershell.exe with empty command lines and multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. Empty command lines might be obfuscation, making it hard to see what's actually being executed. Provider Lifecycle could relate to initializing components, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it raises an eyebrow.\n\nPutting this all together: There are several indicators that suggest potential malicious behavior. The use of powershell.exe downloading files from GitHub into temp directories is a big red flag. Repeated attempts with different command lines might indicate failed attempts or different phases of an attack. Registry modifications by multiple processes could be part of establishing persistence, and deleting tasks or registry entries suggests trying to cover tracks.\n\nHowever, some events like winlogbeat creating configuration files are normal if that's the monitoring tool in use. Also, calc.exe loading a DLL is ambiguous without knowing the full context. But considering all together, the batch shows multiple signs of possible malicious activities, especially the PowerShell downloads and registry tampering, which often indicate an attack.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this as interesting because the combination of downloading files via PowerShell, modifying the registry across different processes, deleting scheduled tasks, and attempting to hide traces suggests a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple potentially malicious activities including PowerShell downloads from external sources, repeated Registry modifications, process deletions, and attempts to remove system traces.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where PowerShell is being used with commands like Remove-Item on various .zip and .txt files in the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because deleting temporary files could be part of a script trying to remove evidence or clean up after malicious activity.\n\nI notice that several events involve different files in the TEMP folder being deleted, such as tarefa_base.zip, component_logico.zip, etc. The consistent use of Powershell with these file removal commands raises flags because attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n\nThere are also entries where Powershell is loading images (like clrjit.dll and clr.dll), which could indicate that it's executing code or scripts. Additionally, there's an event involving whoami.exe being executed, which might be used to gather system informationâ€”something an attacker could do as part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of ImageLoad events in Powershell processes. While this isn't necessarily malicious on its own, combined with other activities, it adds to the concern about potential exploitation or loading of malicious libraries.\n\nFurthermore, one event shows a file deletion related to PSScriptPolicyTest, which could be part of script execution policy testing, often seen during attacks to bypass restrictions.\n\nOverall, the batch shows multiple instances of Powershell executing commands that delete temporary files and accessing system components. These activities don't seem like normal user behavior and could indicate malicious intent or an ongoing attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are deleting various temporary files, which may indicate malicious activity attempting to remove evidence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first log shows winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the data directory. That seems normal since it's likely the beat process writing its configuration or data files.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell command removing a file from the TEMP folder. The command line is & {Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\estrutura_padrao.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}. I'm not immediately sure if this is malicious. It could be part of cleanup scripts, but sometimes attackers delete traces.\n\nThen, multiple events show powershell.exe creating files in various locations like the StartupProfileData and a temporary directory. Creating files isn't unusual, but the specific paths might raise flags. The file names are .ps1 script test files and .txt objects, which could be part of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there's whoami.exe being executed twice. This is often used to gather user information. If run by an attacker, it could indicate reconnaissance. But it could also be a legitimate admin checking permissions.\n\nThe chrome.exe event writes to the registry, which is standard for browser activities like setting preferences or extensions. Probably not concerning on its own.\n\nI notice several ProcessAccess events from powershell.exe accessing other processes. This might be suspicious because PowerShell often has legitimate uses but can also be used to access other running processes maliciously. It's a red flag when combined with previous actions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell.exe creating files, deleting others, and accessing processes. The repeated use of PowerShell is concerning. Also, the deletion of files in TEMP and creation of specific .ps1 scripts could be part of a script to hide or execute malicious code. The whoami.exe runs might be for information gathering.\n\nWhile some events are normal, the pattern suggests potential malicious activity. There's a high volume of powershell activities that don't immediately seem legitimate. I'm not entirely certain it's an attack, but there are enough red flags to warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events including file creation and deletion in TEMP directory may indicate suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
