{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at four JSON objects here, each representing an event.\n\nFirst event has process name chrome.exe and a log task about Image loaded for MpOAV.dll located in the Windows Defender directory. That seems normal because Chrome might load various DLLs, especially security-related ones like Defender's components.\n\nThe next two events are both from chrome.exe with Registry value set tasks. These could be related to Chrome adjusting settings or configurations, which is typical for a browser process.\n\nThen there's an event from powershell.exe where it accessed some process. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be malicious if used inappropriately. The fact that it's accessing a process might raise an eyebrow, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the files involved, only the first event has a specific file path pointing to Defender's MpOAV.dll, which is a known legitimate file. The others either don't involve files or reference standard operations for those processes.\n\nI don't see any red flags like multiple failed attempts, unusual file accesses outside of expected behavior, or signs of privilege escalation. All these events seem within the realm of normal operations for their respective processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal process activities involving Chrome and PowerShell accessing resources in a typical manner.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first event, it's from chrome.exe and mentions a DNS query. That seems normal since Chrome does a lot of DNS lookups for websites. The next two are also Chrome processes showing network connections. Again, not unusual unless there's something fishy about the sites being accessed.\n\nLooking at the fourth event, cmd.exe is running some commands to create scheduled tasks with \"calc.exe\" as the task command. That catches my eye because calc.exe is often used in malicious activities to execute commands or spawn other processes. The use of schtasks here might indicate an attempt to persistence by creating startup tasks, which is a common tactic for malware.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. I know that legitimate programs can load various DLLs, but sometimes attackers inject malicious code into legitimate processes. However, in this case, it might just be normal operation since URLMON is part of Windows.\n\nThe fifth event shows schtasks.exe creating another task with calc.exe again. This repetition makes me more suspicious because multiple scheduled tasks pointing to the same potentially harmful executable could be a sign of malicious activity trying to establish persistence across reboots.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe is involved in registry value sets and file creations. Svchost is a common process for services, but sometimes it's used by malware to hide their activities. The creation of tasks with specific names like \"pacote_secundario_005_OnLogon\" seems arbitrary, which might be an indicator of something being set up at startup or logon.\n\nThere are several events where svchost.exe interacts with the registry and creates files in the Tasks directory. This could be part of setting up persistence mechanisms, as malware often creates registry entries or scheduled tasks to ensure it runs on system startup or logon.\n\nOther processes like conhost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and powershell.exe also show registry activity. While these are legitimate processes, unusual registry modifications by them might warrant closer look. Powershell in particular is a favorite for attackers due to its scripting capabilities, so seeing it modify the registry could be concerning.\n\nThe last several events again involve Chrome.exe making multiple registry changes. It's unusual for a browser process to interact with the registry so频繁ly. This could indicate some form of tampering or an attempt to hide malicious activities by modifying system configurations through registry entries.\n\nPutting all this together, I notice a pattern of creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the command, repeated modifications to the registry and file system by svchost.exe, and unusual registry activity from multiple processes. These behaviors collectively suggest potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence and possibly executing commands without user interaction.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as scheduled task creations with calc.exe, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and unusual network and DNS activity from Chrome. These patterns suggest possible persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
