{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' being executed. That's a common utility used to find out user information. Not inherently suspicious unless it's part of something else.\n\nNext up is 'powershell.exe' accessed. PowerShell can be both a legitimate tool for admins and also commonly used by attackers for scripting and lateral movement. But just accessing it doesn't mean anything malicious yet.\n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' which triggered a registry value set event.Cmd is standard for command-line operations, and modifying the registry isn't unusual. Could be part of normal system configuration.\n\n'Services.exe' setting registry values multiple times. Services.exe is related to services management in Windows. Modifying registry keys here might be part of legitimate service installations or updates.\n\nA 'sc.exe' process creating a new service with a command that includes a script from \"C:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1\". The path looks suspicious because it's referencing a non-existing script, which could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code. That raises my eyebrow because it's trying to run something that doesn't exist.\n\nThere are several instances of various processes like 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and others accessing or modifying the registry. These are typically normal operations unless there's an unusual pattern or frequency, which I don't see here yet.\n\nThe last few events involve 'chrome.exe' loading DLLs, which is standard for browser operation. No red flags there.\n\nPutting it all together, the standout event is the use of 'sc.exe' to create a service that references a non-existing script path. This could be an attempt at persistence or executing malicious code, which makes the entire batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains events indicating potentially suspicious activity, such as multiple registry modifications and a process creation involving 'sc.exe' with a script path that may not exist.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
