{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's the process \"whoami.exe\" being created with the command line pointing to C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe. That seems normal because whoami is a standard system tool used to display user information. No red flags there, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious. Accessing it alone isn't suspicious unless it's doing something bad next. Let me check the other events where powershell is involved.\n\nThird event: cmd.exe is run with a command that adds an entry to the HKCU registry Run key. The command line looks like it's executing \"cmd.exe \/c REG ADD...\" which appends a new value called \"registro_auxiliar\" pointing to C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. That's interesting because adding entries to the Run key typically means creating a persistence mechanism for a program. If estrutura_principal.exe is malicious, this could allow it to run at startup.\n\nFourth event: powershell.exe sets a registry value (rule: RegistryEvent). This could be related to the previous cmd command. Maybe the PowerShell script is modifying the same or another part of the registry to establish persistence or execute commands.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating processes like whoami and powershell, along with modifying registry entries, raises suspicions. It's possible that an attacker is using these tools to create a backdoor by adding malicious scripts or executables to run at startup. The cmd.exe command suggests they're trying to install something persistently, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nI'm confident this batch is worth investigating because the activities indicate potential unauthorized access and persistence mechanisms.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple process creations and registry modifications indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
