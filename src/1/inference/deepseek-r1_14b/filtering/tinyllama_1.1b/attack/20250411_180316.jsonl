Additionally, WMIC.exe was used with a command to delete notepad.exe processes, which is unusual and potentially harmful if used to terminate legitimate processes.\n\nThere's also the use of whoami.exe, which might be part of privilege escalation tactics, and svchost.exe accessing registry objects, which could be an attempt to modify system configurations or hide malware.\n\nThe combination of these events suggests possible malicious behavior.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of log events to see if they're interesting or not. So, the user provided a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My job is to analyze all these events together and decide if they merit investigation.\n\nFirst off, I'll start by looking at the processes involved. I notice that 'powershell.exe' appears multiple times with tasks like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, and even File Delete logged. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused in attacks. The fact that it's being used extensively might raise some flags.\n\nThen there's 'cmd.exe' showing up several times too, especially with commands like \"\/c\". cmd is another common command-line tool that's frequently used by attackers because it's built into Windows and doesn't require installation. The repeated use of 'cmd.exe' without clear context could indicate something suspicious.\n\nI also see 'conhost.exe' a couple of times. Conhost is the console host process, often used by other processes to interact with the command line. Its presence alongside powershell.exe might be part of a chain of commands or scripts, which isn't inherently bad but could be a sign of malicious activity if combined with other indicators.\n\nLooking at the tasks logged, there are multiple instances of Registry value sets and Process accesses. These actions can be concerning because attackers often modify registry entries to maintain persistence or gain privileges. The File Delete logged event in the context of powershell.exe is another red flag; deleting files could indicate an attempt to remove evidence or disrupt system operations.\n\nThe Image loaded tasks involve various DLLs, some from legitimate locations like System32 and Microsoft.NET directories. However, the repeated loading of these modules might be part of a larger script or payload execution. It's hard to say definitively without more context, but combined with other events, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the variety of processes and their interactions. The batch shows multiple process creations and accesses across different binaries, which could suggest a sequence of actions possibly related to an attack chain. For example, using cmd.exe to execute powershell.exe with certain commands is a common tactic in phishing or malware campaigns to evade detection.\n\nAdditionally, the repeated RegistryEvent tasks are significant. Attackers often use registry modifications for persistence, so seeing this across multiple processes might indicate attempts to establish long-term access on the system.\n\nI should also consider the command lines. Some powershell.exe entries have \"& {}\" which is a way to execute commands without outputting anything, possibly to avoid detection by monitoring tools. This technique is often used in malicious scripts to hide their activity.\n\nThe whoami.exe process caught my eye as well. While it's commonly used to check user information, its execution might be part of an attempt to gather system details or privileges. Combined with the other activities, it adds another layer to the potential malicious behavior.\n\nTaking all these points together, each individual event on its own might not be alarming enough to trigger immediate concern, but when analyzed as a whole, they paint a picture of potentially malicious activity. The combination of powershell.exe, cmd.exe usage, registry modifications, and file deletions is consistent with behaviors seen in attack patterns.\n\nMoreover, the presence of multiple related processes and events over a period suggests that this isn't an isolated incident. It could be part of an ongoing attempt to compromise the system or establish persistence. The confidence level here is pretty high because the pattern aligns with known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) used by cyber attackers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" due to the combination of indicators pointing towards possible malicious activity. There's enough here that would warrant further investigation into these processes and their interactions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The events involve multiple instances of powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and conhost.exe with potentially suspicious tasks such as Registry value sets, Process accesses, and File Delete logged.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, most of the events are related to PowerShell processes. I see multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with various command lines. Some of these commands check for the existence of specific .bat files and exit based on that. This could be part of legitimate script execution, but it might also indicate something malicious like checking if a malicious script exists before proceeding.\n\nThere are events showing process creation (Process Create), image loading (ImageLoad), and registry value changes (RegistryEvent). These are common in both benign and malicious activities because many processes load images and interact with the registry. However, the combination of repeated PowerShell executions with specific checks might raise suspicion.\n\nI also notice that some events show file creations or accesses, like .winlogbeat.yml.new being created. This could be related to log shipping tools or SIEM setup, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is normal behavior.\n\nThe use of multiple command lines in PowerShell suggests potential script execution attempts. The fact that each check exits based on the presence of a specific .bat file might be an attempt to ensure certain malicious scripts are present before proceeding with further actions, which could indicate a larger attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there's enough evidence of potentially suspicious activity involving PowerShell and registry modifications to classify this batch as interesting.

Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. The logs show various activities: loading images (like MpOAV.dll and others), file creations and deletions in temporary folders, and registry operations. For example, creating files like '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1' in the Temp directory might indicate script execution or testing.\n\nThere's a pattern where powershell.exe creates a file, deletes it, then creates another one elsewhere. This could be part of a process to test if certain scripts exist or are allowed, which is a tactic used by attackers during lateral movement or persistence checks.\n\nAlso, several registry value sets from chrome.exe and powershell.exe might indicate attempts to modify system configurations, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the command lines, some have explicit script operations using Set-Content and New-Item. These actions could be writing malicious scripts to disk, which is a red flag. The paths mentioned like \"modulo_logico\" and \"elemento_auxiliar\" seem arbitrary but might be part of a structured attack plan.\n\nThe repetition of certain tasks, like multiple ImageLoad events for the same DLLs, suggests that powershell.exe is being used consistently, possibly to load malicious modules or tools.\n\nConsidering all these points together, it's clear there's significant activity from powershell.exe with potential indicators of compromise. The combination of file manipulation, registry changes, and script execution makes this batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion, registry modifications, and loading DLLs suggest potentially malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me start by going through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event shows a PowerShell process with a command line that creates some .bat files in specific paths. That's a bit concerning because script execution can be malicious, but it might also just be legitimate scripting. I'll note the file creation events as potential indicators.\n\nNext, there are several entries where PowerShell is accessing various files and registry values. The FileCreate task shows new files being made, which could be part of normal operations or setup processes. However, the paths like \"C:\\modulo_secundario\\...\" and others seem a bit arbitrary and might not align with standard system directories, raising suspicion.\n\nI also see multiple ImageLoad events for DLLs related to Windows Defender. This is a bit odd because it's unusual for PowerShell scripts to load these modules unless they're trying to obfuscate their activities or access certain functionalities that require elevation.\n\nLooking further down, there are several Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks. These seem repetitive and might be part of the script checking multiple conditions. The use of Test-Path cmdlets to check for files' existence could indicate an attempt to ensure certain scripts exist before proceeding, which is a common tactic in malicious activities to avoid detection.\n\nThe command lines often include complex paths with \"..\" which suggests they're navigating up directories. This might be an effort to reach specific locations on the drive, possibly accessing areas where user permissions are different or to hide the script's true location.\n\nPutting it all together, while each individual event could have benign explanations, the combination of multiple file creations in unusual paths, repeated checks using Test-Path, and the use of PowerShell for these operations suggests a potential malicious activity. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some actions like creating files might be part of system administration tasks, but the repetitive nature and specific paths lean towards something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events showing file creations in unusual paths and repeated checks for script existence suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. Let me look at the command lines.\n\nOne event shows powershell.exe executing a script that checks if a file exists in specific paths. If the file doesn't exist, it exits with 0; else, 1. This seems suspicious—maybe trying to check if certain files are present before proceeding with something else.\n\nAnother event has a similar structure but checking different paths. It's like multiple checks across various directories, which could be part of a larger script trying to locate specific files or ensuring prerequisites are met.\n\nThere are also events where PowerShell loads images and accesses registry values. These activities can be normal, but combined with the file creation and access events, they might indicate an attempt to drop files or modify system configurations.\n\nA whoami.exe process was started, which is usually harmless unless it's part of privilege escalation. But in this case, it doesn't seem linked directly to other malicious actions, so maybe it's just a user checking permissions.\n\nThe file creation events point to specific paths where temporary PowerShell scripts are being created. Temporary scripts can be a sign of scripting activities that might not be intended for logging, but when combined with multiple checks and registry modifications, it raises concerns about potential persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the justification, there's a pattern of repeated file checks, script execution, image loading, and registry modifications. These behaviors together are indicative of potentially malicious activity, possibly involving script-based attacks or lateral movement within a network.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while individual events might not be alarming, their combination strongly suggests an attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command lines checking for file existence across different paths, combined with file creation and registry modification activities.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nThe first few events show processes like powershell.exe and whoami.exe being created. Powershell is a common tool for admins but can also be used maliciously, so I should keep an eye on it. However, the commands here don't seem immediately suspicious—just checking if certain files exist and exiting based on that.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe accesses the registry or loads various .NET DLLs. This is normal for Powershell scripts as they often interact with system components. But I should check if these interactions are typical or if any of them look out of place.\n\nThen, towards the end, I see several events where Powershell is being executed with command lines that check for the existence of specific .cs files and exit based on their presence. This pattern repeats multiple times, which might indicate some automated process or script checking certain directories. Since all these commands are similar and don't show any malicious activities like downloading files or executing scripts, it doesn't raise red flags.\n\nConsidering all events together, there's no evidence of unusual behavior, exfiltration attempts, or signs of a breach. The repeated checks for specific files might be part of a system's health monitoring or deployment scripts. Without more context on the environment and standard procedures, it's hard to say definitively, but based on what's here, I don't see any clear indicators of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal process creations and file access checks by PowerShell and other utilities without evidence of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries related to PowerShell. Specifically, there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that check the existence of certain files. For example, commands like `Test-Path` are used to see if specific .ps1 scripts exist. This behavior could be normal for script execution checks, but it's a bit repetitive and varies across different paths.\n\nThere's also file creation and deletion events involving temporary files in various directories, like C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. The creation of these files by PowerShell might indicate the execution or testing of scripts. Additionally, there are registry value sets, which could be part of script configuration but might also be used for persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the file deletions after creation. This pattern—create a temp file and then delete it—can sometimes be a sign of malicious activity where files are created temporarily to execute code without being detected by antivirus scans.\n\nMoreover, several events show that powershell.exe is loading different DLLs, such as MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. While some of these might be legitimate, the combination with other behaviors could raise suspicions.\n\nThe repeated use of different paths in the command lines suggests an attempt to check for files across various locations, possibly indicating a broader scope or trying to avoid detection by checking multiple potential script repositories.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual events might not necessarily be malicious, the overall pattern—repeated PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion and multiple file checks across various directories—raises concerns. This could indicate scripting behavior that's attempting to establish persistence or perform unauthorized actions on the system. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with repeated file creation\/deletion and checks across various paths suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, the logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. The fields include process information, Windows log details, and file paths where applicable.\n\nLooking at the first event: It's PowerShell executing a command that checks if a specific .ps1 script exists. If it does, exit with 0; else, exit with 1. That seems like a way to check for the presence of another script. The task is 'Engine Lifecycle', which I think refers to the start or stop of a service.\n\nThe second event is similar but checking a different path for the same script. This repetition might indicate multiple attempts to verify if the malicious script exists on the system.\n\nNext, there's an event where PowerShell loads MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal since it's part of Windows Defender, so that doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent for collecting logs, so this is probably just setting up configuration files and isn't concerning on its own.\n\nAnother event has PowerShell creating a file related to the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. Again, normal behavior when initializing user profiles for non-interactive sessions.\n\nPowerShell accessing or modifying registry values multiple times could be suspicious, especially if done by scripts that aren't typically used for system administration. This might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or changing configurations to allow malicious activities.\n\nThere's an event where svchost.exe is involved in network connections and DNS queries. SvcHost is a common process that hosts various services, so it's not inherently bad, but unusual network activity from it could be a red flag.\n\nMultiple Chrome.exe entries with network connections and DNS queries are expected if the user is browsing normally. However, the frequency might raise an eyebrow, especially if combined with other events.\n\nI notice several PowerShell executions checking for specific script files and modifying registry values. This behavior could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious scripts once they're confirmed to be present.\n\nThe confidence level here isn't super high because some of these actions can be legitimate, but the repetition and combination of events suggest potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances checking for a script's existence, modifying registry values, and unusual file operations could indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's go through them one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst event shows PowerShell deleting a file. That's concerning because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities. The file path seems legitimate, but the deletion might be part of an attack to cover tracks.\n\nThe next few events are about Pipe Created and Provider Lifecycle tasks in PowerShell. These don't look too suspicious on their own, but combined with other events, they could indicate script execution or lateral movement.\n\nI notice multiple entries where the command line is a long string with ls, get-childitem, and gci commands. This seems like a script running directory listings recursively, which might be part of data gathering or reconnaissance.\n\nThere's an event about loading MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's normal since it's part of legitimate software, but sometimes attackers use such paths to hide malicious activities.\n\nA file creation event by winlogbeat.exe doesn't raise flags unless the tool is being misused, which isn't evident here.\n\nAnother File Created event in PowerShell StartupProfileData-NonInteractive could be standard behavior, but I'm cautious because non-interactive profiles might not log much activity.\n\nRegistry value set and Process access events are also logged. These can be part of normal operations but could signal configuration changes or process manipulation by malware.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands suggests possible malicious scripting.
