I'm seeing multiple entries where PowerShell is being used with specific commands that search for patterns related to passwords in various file types like XML, DOC, TXT, and XLS. This kind of activity could be malicious because it might indicate someone trying to extract sensitive information.\n\nI notice that the same command line appears several times, which suggests repeated attempts or a script running multiple times. That repetition raises flags because attackers often use scripts to automate their tasks, especially ones that look for credentials or sensitive data.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events in temporary directories, like creating a PowerShell script test file. This could be part of an attempt to execute malicious code or test the environment's security.\n\nLooking at other processes like svchost.exe and Calculator.exe writing to the registry might not seem suspicious on their own, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it makes me think about persistence mechanisms. Attackers often use legitimate tools for malicious purposes, including creating registry entries to maintain access.\n\nThe overall pattern—repeated PowerShell commands searching for passwords, file creation in temp folders, and multiple registry writes—creates a concerning picture.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of activity from Chrome.exe, including DNS queries and loading AMSI.dll. That seems normal since Chrome is a common application. But then there are multiple network connection detections from Chrome—three in a row. That might be worth looking into because frequent connections could indicate something suspicious, but it's also possible it's just regular browsing.\n\nNext, I see several events involving powershell.exe. Powershell can be used maliciously, so any activity here is a red flag. There are file creations with specific names like 'objeto_logico.txt' and 'estrutura_ativo.txt', which might be related to some script or payload being executed. The command-line in one of the events shows powershell.exe accessing processes and registry values, which could indicate privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere's also activity from cmd.exe and schtasks.exe. The command line for cmd.exe includes deleting scheduled tasks using schtasks, which is interesting. Deleting tasks might be an attempt to remove traces or disable certain system functions. This kind of behavior can be malicious if it's part of a larger script trying to maintain persistence.\n\nAnother event shows WMIC.exe being used with a command-line argument to delete processes where the name is 'notepad.exe'. Using WMIC for process deletion could be a way to terminate legitimate or other malicious processes, which might be part of a script aiming to control system behavior.\n\nLooking at all these together: multiple network connections from Chrome, powershell activity including file creation and registry changes, cmd deleting scheduled tasks, and WMIC terminating processes—this combination raises red flags. It seems like there's a sequence of actions that could be indicative of malicious behavior, such as creating files, modifying the registry, deleting tasks, and terminating processes.\n\nHowever, some of these activities can also occur during legitimate system operations or user activity, especially with tools like powershell being commonly used for both good and bad purposes. The number of events involving potential indicators of compromise is notable, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. But given the variety and specificity of the actions, especially the deletion of scheduled tasks and process termination via WMIC, I'm leaning towards this batch being interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple suspicious activities including Powershell command-line activity, deletion of scheduled tasks, and network connections from Chrome.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if it's interesting or not. Let me start by going through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries where processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and powershell.exe are being used. Some of these have tasks related to Registry value sets, Process Create, and File Delete logged. The repetition stands out—there are multiple instances of cmd.exe setting registry values, which might be normal administrative activity, but in bulk, it could indicate something suspicious.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries that deletes specific files in the Temp directory. That caught my eye because deleting temporary files isn't unusual, but the exact paths mentioned seem tailored, like \"unidade_temporario_calc.txt\" and \"estrutura_auxiliar_calc_decoded.exe.\" These names are pretty specific, which makes me think they might be part of some malicious activity trying to clean up traces.\n\nAlso, there's a cmd.exe process with an unusual command line that deletes files in the Temp directory. This could be part of a script or malware trying to remove evidence of its presence. The fact that it's deleting multiple specific files is concerning because legitimate processes usually don't target such precise filenames.\n\nThe use of powershell.exe multiple times also raises a flag, especially when combined with registry modifications and process access events. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for lateral movement and executing malicious scripts, so the repeated ProcessAccess tasks could indicate someone trying to gain deeper system access or persistence.\n\nI'm noticing that some events have 'None' in file or process details, which might be incomplete logs, but it's hard to say without more context. However, the combination of these activities—multiple registry changes, process creations, and deletions—creates a pattern that seems more than just regular system usage.\n\nPutting it all together, the repetitive use of tools known for their malicious potential, coupled with specific file deletions, makes me think this batch is indeed interesting. It could indicate an ongoing attack or at least exploratory behavior by someone with malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple instances of processes known for their potential misuse, such as cmd.exe and powershell.exe, performing suspicious activities like registry modifications, file deletions, and repeated process creations.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if the given batch of system events is interesting for investigation. Let's break down each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the events, most are related to powershell.exe processes. There are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being executed with command lines that look a bit off, like 'powershell.exe & {}'. This could be an attempt to execute some script or command via PowerShell, which is often used by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious code.\n\nI notice several tasks under winlog: things like \"Registry value set\", \"Process Create\", and \"Image loaded\". The RegistryEvent indicates that powershell.exe is modifying the registry, which might be a sign of persistence mechanisms being set up. Malware often uses the registry to ensure it runs on every boot.\n\nThere are multiple Process Create events for both powershell.exe and whoami.exe. Whoami.exe is a legitimate tool used to determine user information, but repeated creation might indicate that an attacker is using it to gather information about the system's users or privileges.\n\nThe ImageLoad events show that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll. While these are part of .NET framework which PowerShell relies on, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like PowerShell with custom scripts that load malicious libraries or execute commands.\n\nAnother point is the Pipe Created event. This could be a sign of communication between processes, possibly for command and control or data exfiltration.\n\nThere's also an entry where RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe are modifying the registry. While notepad.exe might seem harmless, any unexpected registry modifications by such processes could be suspicious. Similarly, RuntimeBroker.exe is part of Windows but could potentially be used maliciously if compromised.\n\nConsidering all these events together, it seems like there's a lot of activity involving PowerShell, which is commonly used in attacks. The combination of process creations, registry modifications, and image loading could indicate that an attacker is attempting to establish persistence or execute malicious code on the system. While not every use of these tools is malicious, the frequency and nature of these events make them worth investigating for potential security threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious command lines, registry modifications, and other activities indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of log events. The goal is to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **Calculator.exe**: This process loaded the urlmon.dll file. That seems normal because Calculator is a standard system application and urlmon is related to URL handling, which it might need for some functionality like help links or updates.\n\n2. **svchost.exe**: It set a registry value. SvcHost is a common Windows process used by various services. Registry changes are routine, especially during service operations, so this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\n3. **winlogbeat.exe**: Created a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup for log management. It's creating a new configuration file, which makes sense during setup or updates. No cause for concern here.\n\n4. **powershell.exe**: There's a process access event. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. However, the event just shows that another process accessed it; without additional context like script execution or network activity, this isn't alarming on its own.\n\n5-8. **chrome.exe**: Multiple events here include DNS queries and network connections. The first three are standard as Chrome resolves domain names for browsing. The last two network connection events are typical when navigating to websites. No signs of unusual behavior from Chrome.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, all these activities seem within normal operational boundaries. There's no indication of unauthorized access, data breaches, or signs of malware. Each event is something a benign process would do during regular operations.\n\nI should consider if there's any combination of events that might suggest something more serious. For example, multiple failed login attempts or unusual file accesses across different processes could be concerning. But here, each event individually and collectively appears normal.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All activities are within expected norms for standard system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
