The files are all under the same directory: C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\. These seem to be node_modules folders with various JavaScript files like debug.js, sort.js, etc.\n\nI remember that git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in Node.js projects because of npm. So when you clone a repository or install dependencies, git might create these files as part of the checkout process. The file paths are typical for node_modules, which contains modules and packages needed by a Node application.\n\nEach event shows a different file being created, all within the same directory structure. This looks like a normal setup where someone is working on a project that uses Node.js. Installing dependencies or cloning a repository would naturally result in multiple files being created in node_modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

It seems like the same process is creating multiple files in this specific location.\n\nI know that semver is a package related to semantic versioning, commonly used in JavaScript projects. The node_modules folder is standard for npm packages, so these events look like part of installing or updating a Node.js module. Each file created is a function file, which makes sense during the setup of a package.\n\nSince all events are from git.exe and relate to file creation within a known software development directory, there's nothing unusual here. No signs of malicious activity like multiple failed logins, access to restricted areas, or unexpected processes. It looks like normal development activities, possibly someone cloning a repository or running npm install.\n\nI'm not seeing any red flags such as attempts to modify system files, writes to unusual directories, or other suspicious actions that would warrant an investigation.

So, all these events are from the same process: git.exe. Each event is a file creation under different paths within a node_modules directory.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the files being created are standard for a Node.js project setup. For example, there's package.json, index.js, license files, READMEs, and test directories. These are typical when installing or updating dependencies using npm, which often involves cloning repositories where git is used as part of the process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all within \"C:\\Users\\...Downloads...\" which suggests this might be a user working on their own projects, perhaps setting up a new environment or adding some modules. The specific node_modules folders under different package names like side-channel, signal-exit, slice-ansi, and sshpk are all common npm packages.\n\nI don't see any signs of suspicious activity here. No executables being created outside the expected locations, no files with unusual extensions, and nothing indicating an exploit or malicious script execution. It seems like normal development operations.\n\nSo, while each event individually is a file creation, collectively they don't raise any red flags.

I'm going to go through each event one by one to see if there's anything that stands out as potentially malicious or suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: it's about Microsoft Edge updating its files. The process name is specific, and the file path points to an update file. This seems normal since software updates are common and not inherently malicious.\n\nNext, I see multiple events related to \"Special Logon\" and \"User Account Management.\" These could be part of regular user activity or system processes managing accounts, so they might not indicate anything suspicious on their own unless there's a pattern of repeated failed logons or unusual times.\n\nLooking at the event where services.exe logs a task called \"Logon,\" that's typical for background services and shouldn't raise red flags. The taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll is also normal as it's part of Task Scheduler functionality.\n\nThen, there's an entry from powershell.exe creating a file in the PowerShell profile directory. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, this event shows a legitimate use case—creating a startup profile for non-interactive sessions. Without additional indicators, like execution of scripts or unusual commands, this doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThe chrome.exe events are about DNS queries and registry changes. These activities are standard for web browsers accessing domains and managing settings, so they don't raise concerns here.\n\nI notice svchost.exe being called with a specific command line parameter for BthAvctpSvc. Svchost is a common system process that hosts various services, and this particular service (BthAvctpSvc) relates to Bluetooth audio processing, which isn't typically associated with malicious activity. The file path here is also standard.\n\nThere's another event involving MsMpEng.exe loading taskschd.dll, which again points to legitimate Windows processes, likely related to system health or updates.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file in the user's directory is expected if this tool is being used for log management. It doesn't indicate any malicious intent unless there's unauthorized access or data exfiltration, which isn't evident here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe creating files under its update directory is part of the normal Edge update process, so no issues there.\n\nCompatTelRunner.exe and MpCmdRun.exe also loading taskschd.dll are standard for their respective functions—compatibility and antivirus-related processes. The file paths involved don't suggest any malicious activity.\n\nConhost.exe modifying registry values could be part of console host operations. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious, but it's not an uncommon event.\n\nMpCmdRun.exe loading MpClient.dll is expected as part of Windows Defender operations, so that's normal.\n\nMintty.exe and git.exe events seem related to software development tools. Git creating a file in a user project directory is typical for someone working on code. Unless there's evidence of unauthorized access or malicious scripts, this isn't concerning.\n\nThe final event from the system showing \"None\" task likely indicates an informational log that doesn't affect security posture.\n\nOverall, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity across these events. Most events are related to legitimate processes like software updates, user account management, and application usage. While some could be potentially concerning in isolation, the entire batch appears normal when considered together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, file operations, and logon events without any indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}

The node_modules folder typically contains dependencies and packages installed with Node.js.

The key pieces of information in each event are the process name, the task from winlog, and the file path.\n\nThe process name is consistently \"git.exe\" across all events. That makes me think that these are all related to Git operations. Now, looking at the task field, they all mention \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is about a new file being created.\n\nNext, I'm examining the file paths. They're all under \"C:\\Users\\...\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\", and then various node_modules directories with different files like .js, .json, and documentation files like man pages. This looks like a standard setup where someone is working on a Node.js project because of the presence of node_modules.\n\nSince all events are generated by git.exe creating files within a node_modules directory, it seems like this is part of a Git repository's normal operation when cloning or updating dependencies. Each time a file is created during a clone or fetch, Git would create these files, and each creation triggers an event.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The paths are typical for a software development environment, and the process involved is a well-known tool like Git. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown processes creating files, or attempts to modify sensitive areas outside the project directory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, these events are part of normal Git operations during development.

That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control and development. So it's not unusual to see it creating files, especially if someone is working on a project.\n\nThe windows log task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means each event is about a file being created. The files are all located in the path \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\tcomb\\lib\\\", with various filenames like fromJSON.d.ts, func.js, fail.js, and so on.\n\nHmm, node_modules is a directory typically found in Node.js projects. So this looks like Git is cloning or creating files within a project's node_modules folder. But why would Git create multiple JavaScript files here? Maybe the user is running some npm commands that involve writing to these files as part of installing packages or during development.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

Each line is a separate event, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, they all seem similar. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file details. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\", which tells me this activity is related to Git, a version control system. The Windows log task is labeled as \"File created\" with the rule being \"FileCreate\". That suggests each event is about a file creation action.\n\nLooking at the files being created, all paths start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\tcomb\\\" followed by various filenames. These look like they're part of a Node.js module because \"node_modules\" is standard in such setups. The specific files include changelog.md, index.d.ts, index.js, and several .js files under the lib directory. Some examples are Any.js, Array.js, Error.js, etc.\n\nNow, considering Git's typical behavior when working with Node modules, especially during an install or clone process. When you run `npm install`, Git might be used to check out dependencies, and this could involve creating various files as part of the module setup. The creation of these .js and .d.ts files makes sense in that context.\n\nI should think about whether creating multiple files at once is normal. If someone is setting up a project or updating dependencies, it's common for several files to be created. Also, all events have the same process name and similar file paths, indicating they're part of the same operation.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior here? The files being created are standard Node.js modules and documentation files. There’s nothing in the filenames or paths that suggests they’re malicious, like executable files outside the module structure or scripts with suspicious names.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes attackers might use legitimate tools for their activities to blend in. However, in this case, it's Git creating expected files during a typical Node module setup. Without additional context like unusual timestamps, multiple failed attempts, or access from unknown sources, there’s no clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, since all events are consistent with normal Git operations when handling Node modules, I’d say the confidence is high that this isn't concerning. The pattern matches expected behavior without any red flags.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which are typical during npm install or project setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
