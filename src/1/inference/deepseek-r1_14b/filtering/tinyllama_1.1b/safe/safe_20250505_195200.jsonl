I'm given a batch of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine whether the entire batch is relevant for investigation. The output should be a single classification: either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\", along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the process SDXHelper.exe. The paths of these files are all under the same directory within the user's AppData folder, specifically in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames vary but follow a pattern with \"excel-copilot-strings\" as a base and varying suffixes.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Excel add-ins or custom solutions. It's common for such processes to create multiple files when installing or updating add-ins, especially if they're dealing with resources like JavaScript files. The repetitive nature of these events suggests that it's part of a normal installation or update process.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's no indication of any unusual activity. All files are within expected locations for Office-related data. There's no sign of known malicious file names or locations outside the standard directories. Additionally, since all events are from the same process and in the same location, it doesn't raise flags for something like a spreading infection or unauthorized access.\n\nI also consider that sometimes legitimate software updates can generate multiple log entries as they deploy various components. The fact that each event is just a file creation without any associated errors or permission denials supports this idea. There's no evidence of failed attempts or other anomalies that would suggest malicious intent.\n\nFurthermore, the consistent naming pattern in the filenames indicates they might be different parts of a larger resource or configuration files necessary for the add-in to function. This kind of activity is typical during software setup or updates and doesn't align with common attack vectors like data exfiltration, encryption (which would involve more varied file types), or direct system compromise.\n\nTaking into account all these points, I don't see any red flags that would necessitate an investigation. The events appear to be part of a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office add-ins. Therefore, the batch is likely not interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe within a standard Microsoft Office directory, which appears to be part of normal Excel add-in installation or update processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The process name in each is \"SDXHelper.exe\", which seems familiar but I'm not sure if it's malicious. The task is \"File created\" according to the winlog rule.\n\nI notice that there are multiple file paths, all under the same user and within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Each path ends with a different .js file, but they all follow a pattern: excel-copilot-strings followed by a long hex string.\n\nFirst thought is whether this is normal behavior. Since it's related to Office and Copilot, which are legitimate features, these files might be part of Microsoft's updates or new feature packages. The fact that there are multiple such files could indicate they're being downloaded or cached as part of an update process.\n\nBut why so many? Maybe the system is installing multiple components for Copilot. Each .js file could be a resource needed for the feature to work properly. Since all events come from the same parent process and location, it doesn't seem suspicious at first glance.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known as a legitimate process. A quick search tells me it's part of Microsoft's Diagnostics or possibly related to Office updates. That reduces the chance of it being malicious.\n\nAlso, all events are file creation events in the same directory. No deletions, modifications, or other actions that might indicate tampering. The paths are deep within user-specific AppData folders, which is standard for application data storage.\n\nConsidering all these points, while it's always good to be cautious, this batch doesn't show any overt signs of malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity standpoint. All the events are in JSONL format, each being a separate line with similar structures.\n\nFirst, all events have the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because it suggests a single process is responsible for multiple file creation events. I'm wondering if this is normal behavior or if it could indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the event details, each entry shows that a file was created under the task in Windows logs as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files are located in a path within the user's AppData folder, specifically under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. That makes me think these might be related to Office add-ins or custom solutions.\n\nThe filenames all follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_[hash].js\". The varying parts after the underscore seem to be different hashes or identifiers. I'm thinking these could be JavaScript files, possibly scripts used by the Excel application or its add-ons.\n\nNow, considering that this is from a legitimate Microsoft Office package, it's possible these files are part of normal operations. However, creating so many files in quick succession might not be typical. I should check how many such files are expected to be created during normal operation. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is generating multiple JS files rapidly, it could indicate an issue or attempt to create a large number of files, which sometimes is a tactic in attacks like file flooding or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother angle is the naming pattern. The consistent prefix and varying suffixes suggest that these might be unique identifiers for each script, but without knowing the exact count expected, it's hard to say if this is normal. Malware often uses such patterns to create multiple files as part of a payload distribution or to avoid detection.\n\nI also notice that some file paths repeat, like \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_86ba5bba225de51a895b0be3e7d18f6f.js\" appearing twice. This duplication might not be significant on its own, but combined with the high volume, it raises questions about whether this process is functioning as intended or if there's a loop or error causing repeated writes.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because SDXHelper.exe sounds like a legitimate process from Microsoft, especially within the Office suite. The creation of multiple JavaScript files in an expected location might be part of how Excel handles its add-ins or dynamic content. However, if these files were being created outside the usual patterns or in unexpected locations, it would definitely warrant further investigation.\n\nAnother consideration is whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. I recall that Microsoft Office uses various helper processes for different functionalities, so this might just be one of them managing resources like scripts or add-ins. If these events are part of the standard setup or updates, then they're not malicious.\n\nBut if I had to assign a confidence level, I'd say 0.2 because while it's more likely legitimate, there's still some uncertainty without deeper context about what SDXHelper.exe does and whether creating multiple JS files is normal for this process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process within a Microsoft Office-related directory.

This seems like a standard user profile directory. The specific subdirectories include SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles, which are typical for Microsoft Office's add-ins or packages.\n\nThe filenames contain various hashes, like \"8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c\" and different resource names such as \"vendors~...\", \"excel-copilot-strings_...\", etc. These look like they could be part of Office's package resources, possibly JavaScript files used by add-ins or components.\n\nSince all events are from the same process creating multiple files in a standard user directory structure, this doesn't raise any immediate red flags. It seems normal for an application to create or update resource files during operation. There's no indication of unauthorized access, unusual file paths, or suspicious activities like deletion or execution.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. Maybe it's part of some legitimate software? I should check that. If it's a Microsoft-related tool, then these file creations are expected. Alternatively, if it's unknown, it might be suspicious.

This repetition suggests that it's part of a normal process, possibly during an update or installation of Microsoft Office features, like language packs or additional resources.\n\nThere's also one event from \"cleanmgr.exe,\" which is related to disk cleanup, and this doesn't seem suspicious on its own since it's a standard system tool.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they don't exhibit signs of malicious activity. The repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe aligns with typical Office software behavior when updating or managing resources.

The task in each case is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file paths are all within the same directory structure under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages.\n\nThe file names seem to follow a pattern, mostly variations of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" with different hashes as suffixes.

Let me start by looking at the data provided.\n\nEach line in the JSONL file represents an event. They all have similar structures. The \"process\" field shows that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The \"winlog\" indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called \"FileCreate\". The \"file\" path points to various JavaScript files inside an Office SolutionPackage directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nFirst off, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe might be related to software like Fiddler or other debugging tools. But in this context, it seems like it's creating multiple JavaScript files. That might not be unusual if it's part of a legitimate process, maybe during an update or installation of some Office add-ins.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all the created files are under \"PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\" with different hashes in their filenames. This suggests that these could be cached or backup files used by Microsoft Office, perhaps for the AI Copilot feature. The naming convention (like officeaicopilot-strings.min_*) indicates they're string resources for that feature.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if multiple file creations from SDXHelper.exe are normal. If this is a legitimate process tied to Office updates or caching, then it's not suspicious. However, if this activity is outside the usual patterns, like occurring at unusual times or creating files in unexpected locations, it might be concerning.\n\nBut given that all events show the same parent directory and consistent naming, it doesn't seem to indicate any malicious intent.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, all the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. Each event has three main components: process information, Windows log details, and file path information.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" every time. This seems consistent across all events except for one where it's \"winlogbeat.exe\". The task in each event is labeled as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which suggests that a file was created.\n\nThe files being created are located in the path:\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\\\PackageResources\\\\OfflineFiles\\\\\"\n\nThe filenames vary but follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings_ae472176788f34d49d54e390a436dca9.js\" and similar. This looks like they are JavaScript files with long hex strings as their extensions.\n\nNow, considering the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", I recall that this is a legitimate Microsoft Office process related to managing add-ins or solution packages. So it's not unusual for this process to create files in its associated directories. The fact that multiple files are being created seems normal, especially if they're part of an update or package installation.\n\nThe only outlier is the event where the process is \"winlogbeat.exe\", which is likely a log management tool, perhaps shipping logs out. This might be creating some configuration file, which doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nI'm checking if these file creation events could indicate malicious activity. Since they're all under an Office Solution Packages directory and the process is legitimate, it's less likely to be suspicious. However, a large number of files created in quick succession might warrant closer look, but in this case, each event seems isolated without additional context.\n\nThere are 14 events in total, with multiple instances creating similar-named JS files. I'm considering if the repetition is normal or could it indicate some form of scripting or automated process that's writing multiple small files. But again, given the context of Office Solution Packages, this doesn't seem out of place.\n\nI also note that all these file paths are in the user's AppData directory, which is a common location for application-related data and temporary files. So creating files here isn't inherently malicious unless it's part of an exploit or persistence mechanism, which there's no evidence of here.\n\nIn terms of indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see any known malicious file hashes or filenames. The JS files are named with long hex strings, which is a common way to store unique identifiers for files, often used in legitimate software updates or cache mechanisms.\n\nAnother angle: Could \"SDXHelper.exe\" be involved in some exploit? To my knowledge, it's a standard Office component. If there were signs of unexpected behavior from this process elsewhere (like network connections to unknown domains, unusual memory usage), that could be concerning. But with the given data, there's no such indication.\n\nThe winlogbeat event creating a .yml file is also benign; likely configuring the tool or storing some state information.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor for unexpected file creations, especially in sensitive directories, the pattern here seems consistent with legitimate Office operations.

There's no indication of unauthorized access, strange file locations, or unusual naming conventions that would raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, this batch doesn't seem interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the creation of files by the SDXHelper.exe process within expected Microsoft Office directories. These appear to be legitimate file operations associated with Office features, such as Copilot.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
