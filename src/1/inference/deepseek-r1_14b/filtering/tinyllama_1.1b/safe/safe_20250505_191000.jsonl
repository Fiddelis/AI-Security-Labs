{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events related to processes being created. There's \"SDXHelper.exe\" loading different DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. That seems normal because those are common system files. Then there's \"svchost.exe\" setting registry values, which is typical for services running under that host.\n\nI see two instances of \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the user's downloads directory. Winlogbeat is likely an agent used to collect logs, so it makes sense it's writing configuration files. No red flags there.\n\nExcel.EXE appears multiple times with various command lines and loaded DLLs like combase.dll, urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Some of these are system-related, but others might be anti-malware or Office components. The file creations under the Recent folder point to Excel opening files named real_values.csv.LNK, which is just short for .LNK files, indicating shortcuts were created. That seems normal if someone was working with that CSV.\n\nThere's a \"RuntimeBroker.exe\" setting registry values again, which is standard for certain Windows services. Then several events have null process names but tasks like User Account Management or Special Logon. These are likely related to user logins or group policies being applied, which is expected in system logs.\n\nFinally, there are multiple \"None\" task entries with no other data, probably just noise from the system logging process itself.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these events look like normal system activity. No unusual processes, unexpected file accesses, or signs of malicious behavior. The repeated Excel activities and logon events don't raise any alarms based on what I know.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains normal system activities such as process creations, image loads, and file operations that are typical for a Windows environment. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of two events. Each event is in JSONL format. Both entries have the same structure, so let me break it down.\n\nFirst, both events show that the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\". That makes sense because Excel is a common application and seeing its process isn't unusual. Next, looking at the winlog section, each event mentions a task of \"Dns query\" with the rule \"DnsQuery\". I know DNS queries are part of how systems resolve domain names to IP addresses, so it's a standard network activity.\n\nI'm thinking about whether this combination is suspicious. Since both events are identical and involve Excel making DNS queries, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags. Maybe someone is working with data that includes URLs or looking up something using Excel's functions, which would trigger these DNS lookups.\n\nConsidering the possibility of malicious behavior, I don't see anything here that stands out as unusual. There's no indication of failed login attempts, access to restricted files, or other indicators of compromise. The events are repetitive but not necessarily indicative of an attack.\n\nSo, after analyzing both events together, I don't find enough evidence to classify this batch as interesting for investigation. It seems like normal user activity involving Excel and standard network queries.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains two identical events showing Excel making DNS queries, which is not unusual or indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
