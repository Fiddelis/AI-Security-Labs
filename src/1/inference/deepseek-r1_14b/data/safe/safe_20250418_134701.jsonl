Each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The first thing I notice is that every single event has the process name \"git.exe\". That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control, and its associated files being created could be normal during development.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, all these events are labeled as \"File created\" with a specific rule. The paths in the file entries are all under the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Specifically, they're creating files inside \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\". This seems like part of a typical setup where type definitions or modules are being installed or updated.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual activity here. Git is often used in development environments, and creating multiple files under node_modules during an operation like an install or build is normal. There's no indication of file paths that would raise red flags, such as executable files outside the expected directories or attempts to access sensitive areas.\n\nThe user context is \"fiddelis\", which doesn't seem suspicious. All actions are happening within their personal directory structure. The repeated creation of these specific .d.ts files suggests they're related to TypeScript definitions for a project using Cypress and Lodash, which is standard in front-end development.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple file creations by Git under node_modules don't indicate malicious behavior.

Each event is a JSON object and they all seem to be from the same process: git.exe. The task in each case is \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths are all within a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash.\n\nHmm, so first off, I'm thinking about what these events represent. Git is being used here, probably during a development workflow. The files being created are TypeScript definition files (d.ts) in the Cypress types for lodash functions. These are standard when using Node.js modules because they define interfaces that TypeScript can use.\n\nNow, why would multiple file creation events from git.exe be interesting? Well, if someone is setting up or updating their project dependencies, it's normal for npm install to create a bunch of files in node_modules. Git might be tracking these changes as part of the repository's history.\n\nBut wait, could there be something suspicious here? Malicious actors sometimes use legitimate tools like git for command and control or exfiltration. However, in this case, all the events are related to creating type definition files which are expected when installing or updating node modules. There's no indication of any unusual file paths outside the project structure or any executables being created.\n\nAlso, considering that these are multiple consecutive file creations from the same process, it might just be a build step or an install script running as part of CI\/CD or a developer workflow. Without seeing other events like file deletions, access to sensitive files, or network activities, there's no clear sign of malicious behavior.\n\nI'm also thinking about how logging works. Sometimes, legitimate processes can generate a lot of log events, especially during installations or updates. Git itself isn't inherently malicious; it depends on what those files contain and how they're being used.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the volume of events is notable, each individual event doesn't raise red flags. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, encryption, deletion, or other signs typically associated with cyberattacks. Therefore, this batch seems to be part of normal software development activities rather than anything malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple consecutive file creation events by git.exe for standard TypeScript definition files in a node_modules directory, indicating normal development activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes. The user has specified that I should consider the combination of all events and provide only one result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nLet me start by looking at each event in detail. Each line represents a JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nThe process name is consistently \"git.exe\" across all events. The winlog task mentions that a file was created, triggered by the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths vary but they all seem to be within a specific directory structure under \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\". Each event points to a different .d.ts file in this path.\n\nNow, considering these events together, I notice that each one is creating a file, and all are related to the Cypress types for Lodash's functional programming utilities. The filenames like identical.d.ts, identity.d.ts, includes.d.ts, etc., suggest they're TypeScript definition files, which are typically used in development environments to provide type information for JavaScript\/TypeScript projects.\n\nThe fact that git.exe is creating these files makes sense if this is a developer working on a project using Cypress and Lodash. Git often interacts with the file system when cloning repositories or pulling updates, so it's normal for it to create new files during such operations.\n\nI should also consider whether these events could indicate malicious activity. Since all the files being created are standard TypeScript definitions in a node_modules directory, which is typical for npm packages, there doesn't seem to be any indication of suspicious behavior here. No unusual file names or paths, and no evidence of execution or access patterns that would raise red flags.\n\nAnother angle is to think about whether creating multiple files in quick succession could be part of a malicious script's activity. However, given the context of git.exe and the nature of the files, it's more likely legitimate development activity rather than something nefarious.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any other context I might be missing, such as whether these events happened during an unusual time or if there are other logs that correlate with this batch. But based solely on the information provided, the pattern appears consistent with normal file creation during a git operation.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, each event individually doesn't raise concerns, and collectively they don't either. They represent legitimate file operations in a development environment using common tools like git and npm packages.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple files being created by git.exe during normal development activities related to TypeScript definitions in a node_modules directory, indicating routine behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's take a closer look.\n\nFirst, all the events are from the same process: git.exe. Each event reports that a file was created in Windows, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files are located in a path that seems to be part of a node_modules directory within a course folder called \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The specific files created are TypeScript definition files (d.ts) related to lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nSo, considering that git.exe is commonly used for version control, it makes sense that during normal operations, especially when cloning or updating repositories, git might create new files. Node_modules is a standard directory in JavaScript\/Node.js projects where dependencies are stored. Lodash is a popular library, and its type definitions would be part of the project's setup.\n\nGiven that all these events are happening under the same process and within a typical project structure, this doesn't raise any red flags. It looks like routine file creation during development or build processes. There's no indication of unusual activity such as access to sensitive files, multiple failed attempts, or activities outside the expected behavior for git.exe.\n\nI'm also considering if there's any possibility that these events could be part of malicious behavior, but nothing here points to that.

Since they're all from git.exe and involve file creation in a node_modules folder related to Cypress types, it seems like someone is working on a software project using Git. The files being created are TypeScript type definitions for various utility functions (like isError, isFinite, etc.), which makes sense if the person is setting up or updating their development environment.\n\nThere's nothing here indicating any unusual activity typically associated with malicious behavior. No signs of unauthorized access, strange process names, or file accesses in restricted areas. All the paths are within a standard project structure, and the files being created are expected in a typical Node.js project setup, especially if they're using tools like Cypress for testing.\n\nI also consider whether repeated file creation events from git.exe could be suspicious on their own. While it's true that Git operations can sometimes log multiple events, in this case, since all the files are part of the same module and follow a logical naming convention, it doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are 14 such events here, each creating a different .d.ts file. This could be part of an automated process during a build or setup phase. It's not unusual for developers to generate or update type definitions when setting up their environment, especially with tools that automate this process.\n\nAnother point is the consistency in the log entries. Each event is very similar, which is typical for legitimate processes where multiple files are being handled sequentially. If there were variations or inconsistencies in the file paths or process names, that might warrant closer investigation.\n\nI also think about whether these logs could be part of an attack vector. For instance, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools like Git for lateral movement or data exfiltration. However, in this case, since all activity is confined to a node_modules directory and relates to type definitions, there's no indication of any malicious intent or unauthorized access.\n\nConsidering the user context as well, if \"fiddelis\" is a legitimate user account working on their project, then these logs are part of normal development activities. There’s nothing suggesting that this activity is being performed by an external or unknown entity.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such events, especially in a security context, there's no evidence here pointing towards malicious behavior.

Each one starts with \"process\":{\"name\":\"git.exe\"},\" winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)\"},\" and then a file path under \"file\":{\"path\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\n1. **Process Name**: All events are from git.exe. Git is a version control system commonly used in software development. It's not inherently malicious, so seeing it in the logs doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\n2. **Task Type**: The task logged is \"File created\". This means each event is indicating that a file was created. File creation events can be normal in a system, especially during installations or updates. In this case, since it's git.exe performing these actions, it might be part of the development workflow, such as cloning repositories, checking out branches, or installing dependencies.\n\n3. **File Paths**: The paths listed are all within \"C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" with various .d.ts file extensions. These look like TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming utilities. Node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js applications where third-party libraries are stored. Cypress is a popular testing framework, and lodash fp stands for lodash's functional programming utilities.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that git.exe is creating multiple files within the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. This could be part of installing or updating dependencies during development. Since these events are related to normal file operations during software development, they don't appear suspicious on their own.\n\nI also consider whether there's any indication of malicious activity here. For example, if git.exe was being used in an unusual way, like executing scripts or accessing restricted areas, that might warrant closer investigation. However, creating files within a project's node_modules directory is expected behavior when using npm or yarn to install packages, especially in a development environment.\n\nAnother point to note is the consistency of the events.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. I've been given a bunch of JSONL events where the process name is git.exe and each event indicates that a file was created in a specific path under the node_modules folder for cypress and lodash. \n\nHmm, so first off, git.exe is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The files being created are TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) which are typically generated by tools during development. The paths all point to different functions within lodash's type definitions, like startCase, subtract, sum, etc.\n\nI remember that when developers work with Node.js and npm packages like lodash, they often install them via npm, and sometimes these installations or updates can trigger the creation of new files in node_modules. Git is commonly used in such environments to track code changes, so it's not unusual for git.exe to be involved in file operations related to development.\n\nLooking at each event, the same process (git.exe) is creating multiple files in a specific directory structure. The pattern suggests that this might be part of a script or automated process during development, like running tests or building the project, which could involve generating type definitions or other supporting files.\n\nI should consider whether such activity is normal. In a typical development workflow, especially with tools like npm scripts or CI\/CD pipelines, it's common for multiple files to be created or modified in node_modules as dependencies are installed or updated. The use of git here might be part of a post-install script that checks out the latest version of packages or clones repositories, which could explain the file creation events.\n\nIs there any indication of malicious behavior? Well, nothing stands out immediately. There's no unusual executable being run, no access to sensitive files, or signs of data exfiltration. The files created are all type definitions, which are standard in TypeScript projects and don't contain sensitive information by themselves.\n\nHowever, the number of events could be a point of consideration. If this were an isolated incident, it might not raise flags, but having multiple file creation events under node_modules from git.exe might suggest some automated or script-driven process. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of false positives. Sometimes legitimate activities can mimic malicious ones. In this case, since all files are under a well-known project (cypress and lodash), which are widely used and trusted, it's less likely that these events are part of an attack.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether git.exe is being misused. Git itself isn't inherently malicious, but if it were being used in a way that's out of the ordinary for the system, like cloning repositories from unknown sources or committing sensitive data, that could be concerning. But here, all events are about file creation related to type definitions, which seems within normal development practices.\n\nI should also check if these files are part of a legitimate update process. Sometimes when dependencies are updated, their type definitions get recreated or modified. Git might be involved in tracking these changes, leading to multiple create events.\n\nIn conclusion, while the volume and specific nature of these events might seem unusual at first glance, they fit well within typical development activities involving version control and dependency management. There's no clear indication of malicious intent based on the provided data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are part of normal development activity involving file creation by git.exe during TypeScript type definition setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

All the events are in JSONL format, and each line is a separate JSON object. Let me start by looking at what each event contains.\n\nEach event has three main fields: process, winlog, and file. The process field shows that the name is \"git.exe\", which makes me think these are actions taken by the Git version control system. The winlog indicates that a file was created, as per the rule \"FileCreate\". The file paths all point to different .d.ts files located in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp.\n\nLooking at the file paths more closely, they're variations of functions like unescape.d.ts, union.d.ts, unionBy.d.ts, and so on. These all seem to be TypeScript definition files for Lodash's functional programming utilities. The fact that multiple such files are being created in quick succession makes me wonder if this is part of a larger process.\n\nNow, considering the context—Git is often used in development environments, especially when dealing with version control for projects like node_modules. It's possible that someone is setting up or modifying their project environment, perhaps installing new packages or updating dependencies. The creation of these files might be part of a build process or an automated script that clones repositories and sets up the necessary files.\n\nI'm also noting that each file path varies slightly but follows a consistent naming convention. This pattern suggests that this isn't random activity but rather systematic actions taken by Git during operations like cloning, fetching, or updating repositories. Given that all these events are generated by git.exe and relate to creating files in the node_modules directory, it seems like a developer is working on a project that uses Lodash with TypeScript.\n\nSince the activities are tied to legitimate development processes and there's no indication of any unusual behavior such as access from unknown locations, attempts to access sensitive data, or unexpected file creations outside normal workflows, I don't see signs of malicious intent. The events appear to be part of standard software development activities, specifically related to setting up a project environment.\n\nMoreover, the paths are all within expected directories for npm packages and their types. There's no evidence here of anything like unauthorized access, data exfiltration attempts, or other red flags typically associated with malicious behavior. It's more about establishing the project setup, which is a common occurrence in development environments.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's always good to monitor such activities, especially in sensitive environments, there doesn't seem to be any cause for alarm here. The events are consistent with normal Git operations during software development, particularly related to TypeScript and Lodash package setup.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by the Git process during typical development workflows, specifically related to setting up a project's node_modules directory with TypeScript definitions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The presence of .d.ts files indicates TypeScript definitions, which are common in such environments. Git.exe creating these files doesn't seem unusual because during development, especially when pulling or updating dependencies, git can create new files as part of the checkout process.\n\nI also consider that this is a single user's environment—looking at the path, it's under their personal Downloads folder for a course on Software Quality. So, it's likely part of their project setup or development work. There's no indication here of any malicious activity, such as files being created in unexpected locations, unusual file names, or multiple processes accessing restricted areas.\n\nMoreover, each event is consistent and follows the same pattern: git.exe creating a .d.ts file in the cypress types directory. This repetition suggests it's part of a normal build or dependency management process rather than something suspicious like multiple different files being created by various processes.\n\nIn summary, while I'm not an expert, the pattern here looks like standard development activity with no red flags.

The file paths all lead to different .d.ts files under the node_modules directory for cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst, I recognize that Git can perform various operations like cloning repositories, checking out branches, or syncing files. In this case, multiple files are being created, which is typical during a checkout or clone operation when new files are added to the repository.\n\nThe paths point to TypeScript type definition files (.d.ts) for lodash within the Cypress node modules.

The files being created are in the path \"C:\\Users\\...\\\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\", with various filenames ending in .d.ts. Those extensions (.d.ts) usually indicate TypeScript declaration files, which are part of the type definitions for libraries.\n\nNow, considering the context, Git creating multiple files in a node_modules directory suggests that this is part of a software development workflow. The presence of \"cypress\" and \"lodash\" points to these being part of a JavaScript or TypeScript project using Cypress for testing and Lodash for utility functions. \n\nTypically, when developers work on projects, they clone repositories, install dependencies, which might involve creating files in node_modules. The fact that multiple files are created at once isn't unusual—it could be during an npm install or yarn add command.\n\nI'm also noting that all events have the same structure and origin. There's no indication of any anomalies like failed operations, access to restricted areas, or unexpected processes.

On the other hand, \"NOT INTERESTING\" means it's normal and doesn't require further action.\n\nIn this case, these logs align with typical Git operations during development. The creation of type definition files is a standard part of setting up a project's dependencies.

Ten or more file creations in quick succession could sometimes indicate something amiss, but given the context (node_modules and Git), it's likely just part of the build process.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any red flags here.

Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nLooking at each event, they all have similar structures. The process name is \"git.exe\" every time. The winlog task is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. The file paths vary slightly but are all within the same directory structure: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\. Each event has a different .d.ts file being created, like isElement.d.ts, isEmpty.d.ts, and so on.\n\nNow, considering the classification options: INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING. I need to decide if this batch as a whole is something that should be looked into further.\n\nFirst, \"git.exe\" is commonly associated with Git version control system activities. When someone clones a repository, installs dependencies, or works in a development environment, it's normal for files to be created by scripts or tools like npm or yarn, especially when dealing with Node.js modules like Cypress and lodash.\n\nThe file paths point to types definitions (.d.ts) which are part of TypeScript projects. These files are generated during the setup of a project, especially when using tools that manage dependencies. The fact that multiple such files are being created in sequence suggests that it's part of a build process or dependency installation.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided here), if these events occurred within a short period, it strengthens the case that they're part of a normal development activity rather than malicious behavior spread out over time. Malware or APTs usually don't create files in such a structured and repetitive manner related to known software tools.\n\nHowever, sometimes attackers might mimic normal activities. But in this case, the file paths are specific to a legitimate project setup. There's no indication of any unusual location outside the expected project directories or files that don't match common development assets.\n\nAnother consideration is whether these events are part of an ongoing process. If this is happening during initial setup or after a recent code push, it might be normal. If there have been no prior signs of compromise and the user's environment is otherwise secure, this batch is more likely benign.\n\nI should also think about the confidence level. While nothing jumps out as suspicious, I can't entirely rule out the possibility that an attacker is using git.exe for some malicious activity. However, given the context provided by the file paths and consistent task being \"File created\", it's highly probable that this is part of legitimate development work.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these points, I would classify this batch as NOT INTERESTING because the events align with typical user activities in a development environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show multiple file creations by git.exe within a node_modules directory, which is common during development setup.

All the events have similar structures: they mention \"git.exe\" as the process name, the task is labeled as \"File created\" under a specific rule, and the file path points to various .d.ts files in a Cypress types directory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The process name being \"git.exe\" suggests that these events are related to Git operations. Since Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments, it's normal to see Git-related processes generating file creation events, especially during initial setup or when cloning repositories.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all reside within a node_modules directory under \"cypress\/types\/lodash\". This indicates that these are TypeScript type definitions for Lodash functions used by Cypress. The fact that multiple .d.ts files are being created makes sense because installing or updating dependencies in npm (Node Package Manager) often triggers the generation of these type definition files.\n\nI also notice that each event is almost identical except for the specific file path. This repetition could be part of a normal installation process where several files need to be created or updated. It's not unusual for multiple files to be generated during such operations, especially in projects that use TypeScript and have many dependencies.\n\nConsidering the frequency and nature of these events, I don't see any red flags. There's no indication of unauthorized access, suspicious file names, or activities outside the scope of a typical development environment. All actions align with standard Git and npm behaviors when setting up or modifying project dependencies.\n\nAdditionally, since all events are related to the same process and the same type of operation (file creation), there's a high likelihood that this is part of a routine setup or update rather than malicious activity. Malicious actors often vary their tactics and wouldn't typically generate such repetitive and predictable log entries unless they're attempting to blend in, but even then, it would be less likely in this context.\n\nMoreover, the file paths don't point to any sensitive areas beyond the project's node_modules directory, which is a common and expected location for third-party libraries and their type definitions. There's no evidence of these files being executed or accessed in an unusual manner, which could have raised suspicions.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to monitor logs for potential threats, this batch doesn't exhibit any signs of malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have to determine if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. The events are all in JSONL format, each line being a separate event.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I notice that each event has \"git.exe\" as the process name. That makes sense because git is a common tool used by developers for version control. So, it's likely that someone is working on a project using Git.\n\nThe task in each event is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that files are being created. The file paths all point to different .d.ts files inside the node_modules folder of a Cypress project. These are TypeScript type definition files, which are standard in Node.js projects for providing type information to TypeScript.\n\nI see multiple such events, each creating a file under the same directory structure. For example, there's \"some.d.ts\", \"sortBy.d.ts\", and so on. These all seem like they're part of the Cypress types package, which is a dependency in many Node.js projects.\n\nConsidering that git.exe is performing these operations, it might be during an initial clone or a fetch operation where the repository is downloading the necessary files. Alternatively, if someone is installing dependencies via npm or yarn, Git might not be involved directly, so this could be part of the build process.\n\nBut wait, why would Git create files in node_modules? That seems odd because Git typically deals with version control and source code, not necessarily creating files within dependency directories. Maybe it's a script that's checking out tags or something else, but that's less common.\n\nHowever, on second thought, perhaps the user is using a tool like husky or another pre-commit hook that might involve Git operations in a way that interacts with node_modules. Or maybe this is part of an automated process that mistakenly used Git to create files where it shouldn't have.\n\nAlternatively, could this be an indicator of malicious activity? If someone gained access and was trying to drop files, they might use tools like Git as part of their activities. But given the file paths are all .d.ts files inside a standard Cypress types directory, that doesn't immediately raise red flags.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes during development, especially with certain plugins or custom scripts, you can have unexpected processes writing to node_modules. It's also possible that this is a legitimate operation if someone is working on their setup and running commands that involve both Git and npm\/yarn.\n\nBut since all events are similar and repetitive, it suggests a bulk operation. Maybe the system was updating dependencies, or perhaps there's an issue with how files are being written during installation.\n\nI'm leaning towards this not being malicious because the file paths are standard, but I can't be 100% certain without more context. However, seeing multiple file creations in node_modules by Git.exe is unusual enough to warrant some attention, but maybe it's just a one-off event and doesn't indicate ongoing malicious behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, I would classify it as INTERESTING because it's an unusual pattern for Git.exe to create files in the node_modules directory. While not necessarily malicious, it's worth investigating to understand why Git is involved here and ensure there's no unauthorized access or misconfiguration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory suggest potential unusual activity that warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. I'm given four JSONL events, each containing process info, a winlog task, and a file path. The process name is git.exe each time, the task is File created under a specific rule, and the files are all in different .d.ts paths within a node_modules folder related to cypress and lodash.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Since all events involve git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development or when tools like npm install run, it might not be suspicious on its own. These are common actions when building JavaScript\/TypeScript projects with Cypress and Lodash.\n\nI should consider if there's any unusual pattern here. All four events have similar structures and paths, so no anomalies in the data provided. The file extensions are .d.ts, which I know are TypeScript declaration files, commonly generated during builds.\n\nAnother angle is checking for multiple writes from the same process, but since git can handle multiple operations, especially during a clone or install, this isn't alarming. No signs of unexpected processes or access to sensitive areas in the file paths.\n\nSo, overall, these events seem normal and not indicative of malicious activity. The confidence level should be low as there's nothing unusual here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple file creation events by git.exe in a node_modules directory, which is common during development activities and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The key details to note are the process name and file paths.\n\nFirst, every event shows that \"git.exe\" is the process involved. This is a common tool used for version control, so it's not inherently suspicious on its own. However, I should consider if git.exe is being misused in some way.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, each event indicates that a file was created (rule: FileCreate). The files are located under different subdirectories within \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\inatel\\\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\\\node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\\". These paths seem to be part of a Node.js module structure, specifically related to Cypress and lodash types.\n\nThe file names vary, but they all end with \".d.ts\", which stands for \"definition TypeScript\" files. These are typically used in TypeScript projects to define interfaces and types. The presence of multiple such files being created at once might suggest that a package is being installed or a project is initializing.\n\nI should consider whether creating these files could be part of normal development activities. Cypress is often used in testing, and node_modules directories are standard in Node.js applications. Therefore, this batch could simply be the setup phase of a project where dependencies are being installed.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any unusual pattern here. Are multiple \".d.ts\" files created in quick succession? That could indicate a script or automated process, which might not be suspicious on its own. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate build process.\n\nI also consider the user context. The path includes \"fiddelis\", which is likely a username. If this user is known to work with such tools, it's normal. But if there's no prior activity from this user or if the timestamps are outside their usual working hours, that might raise some flags.\n\nAnother angle is the use of JSONL format for logs, which isn't inherently suspicious but could indicate automated log collection.\n\nGiven all these points, while there's nothing overtly malicious evident in the events provided, I'm not entirely certain. It's possible that this activity is part of a legitimate process, like installing or updating a Node.js package. However, without more context about the user's behavior and the surrounding network or system activities, it's hard to be 100% sure.\n\nThe confidence level isn't extremely high because there's no clear indication of malicious intent here. It's on the lower end but not zero since unusual file creation patterns could warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple entries show git.exe creating files in a node_modules directory, which is typical during development setup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
