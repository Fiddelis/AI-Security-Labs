{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some system activity on Windows. The first thing that stands out is that all these events are coming from the same process: git.exe. That's interesting because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. So, if someone is using Git, it could be either a developer working on their project or potentially someone else up to no good.\n\nLooking deeper into each event, they're all tagged with \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" from the Windows log. This means that each time a file was created, this rule triggered an alert. The files in question are all .d.ts files located within the node_modules directory of a Cypress project. Specifically, these files are under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\/. These seem to be TypeScript type definitions for Lodash functions, which makes sense because developers often use such modules for utility functions.\n\nNow, considering that Git is being used here, it's likely part of the development workflow. When a developer clones a repository or pulls updates, Git might create new files in node_modules as dependencies are installed or updated. This would explain why multiple .d.ts files are being created—perhaps during a build process where TypeScript definitions are generated or downloaded.\n\nI don't see any red flags here, like attempts to access sensitive directories or unusual file names that could hint at malicious activity. The paths look standard for a development setup. It's also notable that all events are from the same user account (fiddelis) and all occur in the same directory structure. This consistency suggests it's part of a legitimate process, not scattered across different areas which might indicate something suspicious.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether Git could be used maliciously. While possible, common attack vectors often involve more direct methods like exploiting vulnerabilities or using known malware. The activity here doesn't align with such behaviors; it's more about file creation during what appears to be a normal build or setup phase of a software project.\n\nI should also think about the frequency and volume of these events. There are 15 events in total, each creating a different .d.ts file. This could be part of a larger process where many files are generated or updated. It's not an unusually high number for such operations, especially if this is happening during an initial setup or after pulling changes that require rebuilding the project.\n\nIn terms of justification, these events don't indicate any unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or signs of malware activity. They're all part of what seems to be a standard development workflow involving Git and TypeScript. Therefore, while it's always good to monitor for unusual activities, there's nothing here that suggests the need for further investigation beyond normal monitoring.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activity by git.exe during development, specifically creating TypeScript type definition files in a node_modules directory.

That makes sense because Git is commonly used for version control, especially in development environments. The next part is \"winlog\":{\"task\":\"File created (rule: FileCreate)}\", indicating that a file was created according to some rule named FileCreate.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\\" followed by different filenames like forOwn.d.ts, forOwnRight.d.ts, and so on.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of events provided in JSONL format. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event. My goal is to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nLet me start by understanding each event. They all have similar structures: process information, Windows log details, and file path information. The process name in every event is \"git.exe\". The task described in winlog is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", indicating that a file was created. Each event points to a specific file path under the \"file\" section.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all seem to be within a folder structure related to a course titled \"S206 - Qualidade de Software\". The files are located in the node_modules directory of a Cypress project and further into the lodash fp types. Specifically, each file is a .d.ts file, which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files.\n\nGiven that all events involve git.exe creating these files, it makes me think about what's happening here. Git is commonly used for version control, so perhaps this activity relates to someone cloning or updating a repository, installing dependencies, or making changes in their development environment. The presence of node_modules suggests this might be part of a Node.js project setup.\n\nI'm trying to determine if these events are indicative of malicious behavior. Since all the processes are related to git.exe and file creation within standard project directories, it doesn't raise any immediate red flags. These actions are typical during development work, especially when setting up or modifying a project structure.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether this could be part of some automated process or legitimate activity that might not indicate malicious intent. Given that the files being created are TypeScript declarations for Lodash's fp functions, it seems like they're part of a developer's environment setup. There's no evidence here of any unauthorized access, unusual file creation times, or activities outside normal user behavior.\n\nAnother angle to look at is whether there's an anomaly in the number of events. Here, I see 17 events all related to creating files under node_modules. While that might seem like a lot, if someone is performing multiple operations within their development environment—perhaps during an initial project setup or after restoring dependencies—it could make sense.\n\nI also think about whether these file paths are commonly associated with malicious activities. Lodash is a well-known library, and while there have been vulnerabilities in the past, those are usually related to specific versions and usage patterns, not just the presence of the files themselves. The fact that these are declaration files (.d.ts) further indicates they're part of the development setup rather than anything nefarious.\n\nAdditionally, considering the user context—C:\\Users\\fiddelis—is this a standard username? It seems plausible for a user named fiddelis to be working on their own projects. There's no indication here that the account is compromised or used abnormally.\n\nIn terms of temporal analysis, if these events occurred over a short period, it might suggest something suspicious, like rapid file creation indicative of an installer or script running multiple times. However, without timestamps, I can't assess the timing between each event. But given the uniformity and context, it's likely they happened as part of a single operation.\n\nI also wonder if there's any deviation from baseline activity. If this user typically works with git and node_modules, then these events fit within normal behavior. If not, it might warrant closer examination, but there's no data here to suggest that the user isn't supposed to be performing such actions.\n\nLastly, considering the potential impact: creating TypeScript declaration files doesn't pose a direct threat like executing malicious code or exfiltrating data. These are supporting files for development purposes, so unless there's a specific reason to believe they're being misused, they don't indicate a security issue.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, the activities described here align with legitimate software development practices. There's no evidence pointing towards malicious intent or unauthorized access based on the provided information.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events does not indicate malicious behavior. All events are related to the creation of files during a Node.js project setup using git.exe, which is consistent with typical development activities.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:** Each event involves git.exe creating a file under node_modules, indicating normal development operations.\n2. **File Paths and Context:** The files are TypeScript declarations for Lodash's fp functions, commonly used in projects, not malicious.\n3. **User Context:** The username provided is typical and doesn't suggest unauthorized access.\n4. **No Red Flags:** No signs of unusual timing, multiple failed attempts, or unexpected file locations indicating a breach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are legitimate and part of standard software development processes, posing no security risk."}

Each event is a JSON object, and they all seem to be related because they share similar structures. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the \"process\" field in each event shows that the process name is \"git.exe\". That makes me think these are file operations performed by Git, which is commonly used for version control. The \"winlog\" task indicates that a file was created (rule: FileCreate). So each of these events is logging the creation of a file.\n\nNow, looking at the file paths provided, they all point to files inside \"node_modules\\\\cypress\\\\types\\\\lodash\\\\fp\\\\\". The file names vary but end with \".d.ts\", which I recognize as TypeScript declaration files. These are usually used for type definitions in TypeScript projects. The presence of these specific files suggests that this is part of a Node.js module setup, possibly during a project build or installation process.\n\nConsidering the combination of all events, it seems like Git is creating multiple files within a node_modules directory related to Cypress and lodash's functional programming (fp) types. This is pretty typical when installing or updating dependencies in a Node.js project because npm scripts often run tasks that write out type definitions as part of the build process.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The paths are standard for a development environment, and the actions (file creation by git.exe) align with normal package installations or builds.

Each event is a JSON object with some details about file creations on the system. The process name is git.exe each time, and the task is \"File created\" with the rule \"FileCreate\". The files being created are all under the path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\fp\\*, ending with different .d.ts filenames.\n\nHmm, first thing I notice is that git.exe is a common tool used for version control. It's not unusual to see it creating files, especially during development or when cloning repositories. The path structure looks like it's part of a Node.js project since there are node_modules and cypress involved. Cypress is a testing framework for JavaScript applications, so that makes sense.\n\nEach event shows a different file being created under the lodash fp directory. These files have names like orderBy.d.ts, over.d.ts, etc., which I recognize as TypeScript definition files (the .d.ts extension). Lodash is a popular JavaScript library, and the fp stands for \"functional programming\" module. So, it's likely that someone is working on a project that uses these modules.\n\nNow, considering each event individually isn't necessary because the user specified to analyze the entire batch as a whole. Looking at all events together, they all have the same process name and similar file paths, just different filenames. This seems consistent with normal development activities where multiple files are being created or updated as part of the build or installation process.\n\nI don't see any red flags here. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown processes, or writes to unexpected locations. The user account is fiddelis, which I assume is a legitimate user on the system. The files are within a structured project directory, not in system folders like Program Files or Windows.\n\nAnother point is that each event is triggered by the same task and rule, \"File created\" with \"FileCreate\". This suggests it's part of a standard file creation monitoring process, which is typical for systems to log when new files are added. There's no variation in the type of file being created, which might indicate something malicious.\n\nI also think about whether creating multiple .d.ts files in this location could be indicative of an attack. Usually, attackers would try to create or modify files outside of standard project directories or system areas. Here, it's all within a user's downloads folder and node_modules, which is expected behavior for development tools.\n\nSo putting it all together, these events seem entirely normal for someone using Git in a development environment with Node.js and Cypress.

Node_modules usually contains third-party libraries, so maybe someone is working on a project that uses Cypress and Lodash, which are common in JavaScript\/TypeScript environments.\n\nWhy would Git be creating all these files? Well, when you clone a repository, especially one with node_modules, it's normal for the system to create or update these files.

The paths listed all point to TypeScript files within the \"node_modules\" directory, specifically under \"cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp\". \n\nI know that node_modules is where third-party libraries are stored in Node.js projects, and cypress is a popular testing framework. These .d.ts files are declaration files for TypeScript, which define interfaces and types without implementing them. The process name git.exe suggests that Git is being used to create these files, possibly during a checkout or clone of a repository.\n\nLooking at the paths, they all follow a consistent naming pattern like \"trim.d.ts\", \"unionBy.d.ts\", etc., which are standard names for TypeScript declaration files in lodash\/fp modules. Since these files are part of a known and widely used library, their creation by Git during development activities is normal and expected.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The consistent process name, predictable file paths, and standard filenames indicate that this is just part of the normal software development lifecycle—cloning or updating repositories, installing dependencies, etc. There's no indication of unusual access times, unknown processes, or file locations outside the expected project structure.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, this batch doesn't show any behavior that would raise security concerns.

Let me start by looking at each event individually and then see if there's a pattern or something that stands out when considering all of them together.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The keys are \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The process name is always \"git.exe\", which makes me think this activity is related to Git, perhaps someone working with version control systems like GitHub or GitLab. The winlog indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule called FileCreate. The file paths all point to different .d.ts files located in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp.\n\nLooking at the file paths more closely, they're variations of functions from lodash's functional programming (fp) module. For example, there are files like unzip.d.ts, update.d.ts, words.d.ts, etc. These all seem to be type definitions for Lodash's fp utilities, which makes sense if someone is setting up a project with Cypress and Node.js, as those are common tools in web development.\n\nNow, considering that all events are generated by the same process (git.exe) and involve creating files within a node_modules folder. This suggests that this activity is part of a standard build or setup process for a JavaScript or TypeScript project. The user might be cloning a repository, installing dependencies, or initializing a project, which would trigger Git to create these files as part of the checkout or installation process.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. There's no indication of failed operations, access to sensitive files, or activities outside the scope of typical development workflows. The consistent pattern and the nature of the files being created align with normal project setup procedures.\n\nMoreover, since all events are related to file creation by Git in a predictable location, it doesn't raise any red flags associated with malicious activity. Cyberattacks often involve irregular patterns, attempts to access restricted areas, or processes that don't fit the usual behavior profile. Here, everything seems consistent with legitimate development operations.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any context missing. For instance, if this user is in an environment where such activities are uncommon, it might warrant closer examination. But based solely on the information provided and without additional context suggesting otherwise, these events don't appear suspicious.\n\nIn summary, each event points to normal file creation during a development workflow using Git.

They're all in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The user mentioned that I should treat the entire batch as a whole and not classify each event individually. My task is to determine if the batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n- Each event has three main components: process, winlog, and file.\n- The process name is consistently \"git.exe\". So whatever is happening, it's related to Git operations.\n- The winlog shows that a file was created, with the task being \"File created\" under the rule \"FileCreate\".\n- The file paths are all within a node_modules directory for Cypress, specifically under \"cypress\/types\/lodash\".\n\nI notice that all the files being created have different .d.ts extensions. These are TypeScript declaration files, which define types and interfaces but don't contain executable code. They're part of the module system in Node.js to provide type information.\n\nSince each event is a file creation by git.exe within a node_modules folder for Cypress's lodash types, this seems like normal behavior during development. Installing or updating packages with npm\/yarn would typically involve creating these files as part of building modules.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No suspicious processes, unusual file paths, or access patterns that might indicate an attack. The consistent use of git.exe and the creation of type files aligns with standard software development practices, especially in a project using tools like npm and TypeScript.\n\nTherefore, there's no reason to flag this batch as interesting for further investigation. It looks entirely benign.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities by git.exe during development, specifically creating TypeScript declaration files in a node_modules directory, which is typical and not indicative of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let's start by looking at each event.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event with three main components: process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name is consistently \"git.exe\" across all events, which tells me that the actions are related to Git operations.\n\nThe winlog task is always \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". This indicates that a file was created, and it's being monitored by some rule or policy. So each event is a notification of a new file creation.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206 - Qualidade de Software\\node_modules\\cypress\\types\\lodash\\\" followed by different filenames ending with \".d.ts\". These are TypeScript declaration files for Lodash functions. Examples include isError.d.ts, isFinite.d.ts, etc.\n\nSo, all these events are about creating file type definitions related to Lodash within the Cypress types directory. This seems typical during a development setup, especially when using tools like npm or yarn to install and manage packages. Git might be involved in checking out the repository or syncing changes, which triggers the creation of these files.\n\nI should consider if such activity is normal. In a software development environment, it's common for Git to clone repositories, create files, and update dependencies. The presence of node_modules suggests this is part of a Node.js project setup, which aligns with using Cypress for testing.\n\nIs there any red flag here? None that I can see immediately. There are multiple file creations, but they're all in expected locations related to the project's structure. No signs of unusual paths or operations. The process running is Git, which is a standard tool, so it's unlikely to be malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that each event is identical except for the filename makes me think this might be part of a batch operation, perhaps during an initial setup or after a change in dependencies. Such bulk file creation could also be normal during certain CI\/CD processes or when rebuilding the project.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern or anomaly beyond what's presented. The files created are all type definitions for Lodash functions. Since Lodash is a popular library, having these types is expected in a project using TypeScript.\n\nConsidering confidence, I'm pretty sure this isn't malicious. It fits standard development activities without any signs of tampering or unauthorized access.

The task is consistently \"File created\", according to the Windows log. Each file path points to a .d.ts file inside a node_modules directory, specifically under cypress\/types\/lodash.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they include various functions like nthArg, omit, omitBy, and so on.

Since node_modules is a standard directory in Node.js projects, this seems normal.\n\nI'm noticing that each event is the creation of a single file by git.exe. This could be part of cloning a repository, updating dependencies, or simply initializing the project. The fact that multiple files are being created with similar patterns but different filenames indicates it's part of a script or automated process.\n\nNow, thinking about indicators of compromise (IOCs), I don't see anything malicious here. No signs of file deletions, modifications to sensitive areas outside node_modules, or unusual paths. All the activity is contained within the project's own directories and related to TypeScript type definitions, which are standard in a Node.js setup.\n\nI wonder if git.exe is being used for something else here, but given the file types and locations, it seems like normal development operations. There’s no evidence of any hidden files or execution logs that might suggest malicious scripts running.\n\nSo, considering all these points, this batch doesn't show any signs of suspicious activity.
