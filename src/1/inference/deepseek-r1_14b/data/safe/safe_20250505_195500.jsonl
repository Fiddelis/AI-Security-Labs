This might just be normal processing where multiple instances or retries are happening. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds legitimate as it's related to Microsoft Office updates or solutions.\n\nThere's also an event from \"chrome.exe\" setting a registry value.

There are several events here, all appearing to be file creation events by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The paths in these events point to various JavaScript files within an Office package resource, which seems related to some offline files for the AI Copilot feature.\n\nAt first glance, it's normal for applications like Microsoft Office to create and manage such files as part of their functionality. These could be temporary or cache files needed by the AI features. The fact that multiple identical file creation events are present might just indicate that several resources are being loaded during runtime.\n\nLooking at the timestamps and the frequency, there doesn't seem to be any unusual spike in activity beyond what would be expected from a typical user interaction with Office software. Additionally, one of the events is from \"winlogbeat.exe\", which is likely a log monitoring tool, creating its own fileâ€”nothing suspicious there.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The consistent naming pattern in the file paths and the process involved are indicative of legitimate operations by Microsoft Office components.

This process seems to be creating multiple files in the same path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\... followed by different filenames.\n\nThe task field is consistently \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which means these are file creation events. The paths all end with different hashes, like officeaicopilot-strings.min_01b1c4d03464acf87b14647f4dc2c34f.js and so on. These look like JavaScript files.\n\nI also see two other entries where \"svchost.exe\" and \"chrome.exe\" loaded the BitsProxy.dll file from the system32 directory. That's normal because BitsProxy is part of Windows for managing background intelligent transfer service, which handles file downloads.\n\nNow, considering if this batch is interesting: The repeated creation of multiple JavaScript files by SDXHelper.exe could be suspicious. If an application is generating many files in a short time, it might indicate something malicious, like writing numerous files as part of a payload or data exfiltration. However, I'm not entirely sure because legitimate processes can also create many files, especially during installations or updates.\n\nThe confidence level: Since the same process creates multiple identical files with varying hashes, there's a moderate chance this could be malicious activity.

The fact that multiple files are being created with different filenames but similar names suggests this is a legitimate operation by the software during an update or installation.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's look at the data.\n\nEach event is a JSON object representing an activity on the system. The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\", and each entry indicates that a file was created in the same specific path under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. All the files have similar names with varying hash-like suffixes, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_4304ae23123a85eeca93a99e1e7d2f98.js\" and others.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's normal. SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office. It's part of the Office suite and handles various tasks like updating or managing components. The creation of files in its OfflineFiles directory is typical when Office is downloading or caching resources for offline use, especially features like Office Add-ins or AI Copilot.\n\nLooking at these events, each file creation seems sequential but not excessive. However, there are multiple entries creating the same file path with different hashes, which might indicate repeated attempts or perhaps a script generating these files. Since they're all under the same package ID and resource directory, it's likely part of normal Office operations, especially for features that require offline access.\n\nI should check if SDXHelper.exe is known to create multiple files in this manner. From what I know, it does handle file creation as part of its normal operation. Therefore, seeing several such events isn't unusual unless there's an anomaly like a high volume beyond typical usage or the presence of unexpected files.\n\nAnother angle: Are these file names legitimate? The filenames contain hashes which are common in cached resources to ensure they're up-to-date and consistent across installations. So it seems plausible that Office is just updating its resources.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like writes to unusual directories, attempts to access restricted files, or execution from these paths. Since all activities are within the expected behavior for SDXHelper.exe, I wouldn't classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n\nBut wait, there's a lot of duplicate entries. The same file path is created twice for each hash. Maybe that could be an indicator of something, but it might just be how Office handles caching or redundant writes during updates.\n\nIn summary, while the number of events is quite high, they all fit within normal operations of the Microsoft Office suite. There's no evidence of unauthorized access, malicious file creation, or other red flags. So, I would classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a high confidence level.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the normal operation of Microsoft Office's SDXHelper.exe process creating files in its OfflineFiles directory.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm given a series of JSONL events where the same process, SDXHelper.exe, is creating multiple files in a specific path under the user's AppData directory. Each event shows a file creation task with varying filenames but the same base name and location.\n\nFirst, I recognize that SDXHelper.exe is commonly associated with Microsoft Office updates or solutions. The path points to OfflineFiles, which suggests these are cached files for offline use in Office applications. This isn't unusual since such processes often create multiple cache files when updating or initializing Office features.\n\nI notice there are 14 events, each creating a different JavaScript file. The filenames vary by a hash-like suffix, indicating they might be different versions or components. Since all these actions come from the same process and target a known legitimate directory for Office resources, it doesn't raise immediate red flags.\n\nHowever, the frequency of events catches my eye. Creating 14 files in quick succession could be normal during an update but might also hint at something more insidious if this number is unusually high compared to typical activity. But without context on baseline behavior, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nThe justification leans towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these events align with expected behavior for the given process. Unless there's evidence of deviations from normal patterns (like times when the user isn't using Office or outside business hours), there's no clear indication of malicious activity here.\n\nI'm confident in this assessment, so I'd rate the confidence at 0.75.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, looking at the data, I see multiple JSON objects each representing an event. The process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because I'm not familiar with that specific process off the top of my head. Usually, common processes like \"svchost.exe\" or \"explorer.exe\" are more typical.\n\nNext, the task being logged is a file creation event (\"File created\"). Each event has a unique file path under the same directory but different filenames. The paths all point to an Office-related folder within the user's AppData Local directory. So, it seems like SDXHelper.exe is creating several files there. \n\nI wonder if this is part of normal operation for Microsoft Office or some legitimate helper process. Maybe Office uses such helpers for background tasks or package management. But the number of files created hereâ€”each with different hashes in their filenamesâ€”might be a bit suspicious. It's like it's generating multiple files quickly, which could indicate something malicious trying to create several artifacts.\n\nOn the other hand, if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process for Office updates or package installations, then these file creations would be normal. But without knowing for sure, I have to consider that repeated file creation by an unknown process might be a sign of suspicious activity.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, attackers use such processes to drop multiple files as part of a payload or to create noise in the system. The fact that all events are from the same process and involve creating files makes me lean towards this being potentially malicious.\n\nI should also consider how many such events there are. There are 14 entries here, each with a different file path. That seems excessive if it's part of normal operation. Typically, legitimate processes don't create so many files in quick succession unless they're doing something like unpacking an update or installing multiple components.\n\nMoreover, the naming convention of the files includes hashes (like \"62d7b64c92ca18af...\"), which could be unique identifiers for each resource. This might suggest that it's part of a legitimate package installation process where each file is uniquely named to avoid conflicts. But even so, the volume and the fact that all are from SDXHelper.exe still raise flags.\n\nTo be thorough, I should check if there's any known information about \"SDXHelper.exe\". A quick search tells me it's related to Microsoft Office updates and Solution Packages. That makes sense because the path points to Office's SolutionPackages directory. So, maybe these file creations are part of installing or updating AI Copilot features in Office.\n\nIn that case, this batch might just be normal activity as Office updates its components. However, given that all events are from the same process and involve creating files, it's still something to monitor, especially if the number is unusually high for typical updates.\n\nConsidering confidence level: Since I can't find clear evidence of SDXHelper.exe being malicious and it seems related to a legitimate Microsoft Office process, but there's enough uncertainty about the volume and repetition that makes me cautious.

These seem repetitive, which might indicate normal operation since legitimate software often creates or updates files regularly. The file paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages look like they're part of standard operations, maybe related to add-ins or updates.\n\nThen there are events from \"chrome.exe\" setting registry values and loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. These activities are typical for a browser process interacting with the system. Loading these modules is common and doesn't raise any red flags on their own.\n\nNo signs of unusual processes, network connections, or file deletions that might suggest malicious activity. The repetition of similar file creation events by SDXHelper.exe could be part of an update or cache mechanism, which isn't suspicious in this context.\n\nOverall, the logs don't show anything out of the ordinary for legitimate software operations.

The user has provided a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on the system. My task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation purposes.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. Each line starts with the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path under the user's AppData directory. The files being created have names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by various hashes. Notably, many of these file paths are duplicated; for example, the first and second events create the same file.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here since they aren't included, but I can infer that multiple instances of the same file being created might indicate something suspicious. However, it's also possible that this is part of a legitimate process, such as an application updating or caching files.\n\nThen there's an event from \"chrome.exe\" creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder. This seems normal unless it's associated with malicious activity, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI need to consider whether these events collectively raise any red flags. The repeated creation of the same JavaScript files could be part of a legitimate application's operation, especially if they're related to Office add-ins or similar software. However, the fact that multiple identical files are being created might suggest an issue like a script running in a loop or some form of injection.\n\nAnother angle is the path structure. The long GUID-like string in the path (8c380c94aceebfb21effde79b39e073f) could be associated with a specific package or component, which might not be inherently malicious but worth noting. Malware often uses unique identifiers to avoid detection.\n\nI should also think about the frequency of these events. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating numerous files in quick succession, it might indicate an attempt to flood logs or create persistence points. However, without knowing the normal baseline for this process, it's challenging to assess.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are elements that could be concerning, they don't definitively point to malicious activity. It's possible that these events are part of a legitimate update or cache refresh process. Therefore, my confidence level in classifying this batch as interesting is moderate but not high.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe and chrome.exe.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each representing an event on a Windows system. Let's see what they all have in common.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each JSON object, there are three main keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key tells me that the application involved is \"SDXHelper.exe\". I don't recognize this name off the top of my head, but it might be something legitimate related to software updates or system tools.\n\nThe winlog entry indicates that a file was created, following a specific rule named FileCreate. So each event is about the creation of a new file. Now, looking at the file paths, they all point to files within the \"OfflineFiles\" directory under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages. The exact path is:\n\nC:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\[some GUID]\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\officeaicopilot-strings.min_[various hashes].js\n\nEach file has a different hash suffix in its name, like \"b20b0a77f6fe2ec72ac3e8fa6d33e875.js\" and others. These look like unique identifiers for each JavaScript file.\n\nSo, considering all these events together, I notice that the same process (SDXHelper.exe) is creating multiple files in a specific location. Since they're all under Microsoft Office's directory, it suggests this might be part of an official update or package installation. The repetition of the same process and similar filenames makes me think it's not malicious but rather a standard operation.\n\nI should consider whether creating several JavaScript files could indicate something suspicious. However, in this case, since they're all within expected Microsoft Office directories and following a predictable naming convention, it doesn't raise red flags. It could just be the system updating or installing new resources related to Office features, possibly including AI Copilot functionality, as indicated by \"officeaicopilot\" in the filename.\n\nAnother angle is checking if SDXHelper.exe is known for legitimate purposes. A quick mental note: I recall that Microsoft uses various helper processes for updates and package management, so it's plausible this is a genuine activity.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events occurred over a short period, it might indicate a bulk file creation, which could be normal during an update process. There's no evidence of unusual patterns like files being deleted immediately after creation or access from unexpected locations.\n\nIn summary, while every event is the same typeâ€”file creation by SDXHelper.exeâ€”the consistency and location suggest routine system behavior rather than malicious activity.

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, most of the events involve processes like chrome.exe and SDXHelper.exe performing actions such as file creation, loading images, and registry changes. For example, there are multiple instances where chrome.exe is setting registry values, which seems normal since browsers often interact with the registry for settings or extensions.\n\nThen, I notice that SDXHelper.exe is creating several files in a Microsoft Office-related directory. The file paths all end with .js, which suggests these might be JavaScript resources loaded by Office add-ins or solutions. Since this is related to user-specific data and app packages, it could be part of normal software operation, especially for features like AI Copilot.\n\nAnother point is the creation of files in the Downloads folder, specifically \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". Chrome creating these files and their Zone.Identifier streams indicates that this file was likely downloaded and saved. The multiple events around this file might be due to how Chrome handles downloads, extracting, or scanning them for security purposes.\n\nI don't see any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activities here. All the actions described are typical for user interactions with browsers and office applications. There's no evidence of unusual processes, writes to sensitive areas, or network anomalies that would raise red flags.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing all events collectively, they don't indicate anything suspicious or out of the ordinary.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity, including file downloads and browser operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the first event shows a process named HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. That's a bit unusual because it's not a commonly known process. Registry modifications can be part of legitimate activities but also suspicious ones, especially if done in bulk or with specific keys related to security.\n\nNext, there are multiple events from SDXHelper.exe creating files. The paths point to Office Solution Packages and OfflineFiles. These look like standard locations for Office add-ins or language resources, so the file creations might be normal updates or installations of such packages. However, seeing the same process create the same files twice each could indicate something off, perhaps an error or repeated attempts.\n\nThen, Excel.EXE is involved in creating streams and loading images. The file paths are within temporary directories (like AC\\Temp) which is typical for applications to handle data temporarily. Additionally, the DLLs being loaded seem standardâ€”coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL are known components of Office applications, so this doesn't raise a red flag.\n\nI'm considering whether these activities together could indicate malicious behavior. The repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe might be part of normal operation if it's an update mechanism, but without more context, it's hard to say. Similarly, the registry write by HxTsr.exe could be legitimate or a sign of something malicious.\n\nHowever, all these events happen within user application contexts and don't show signs like privilege escalation, access to sensitive files, or network communications which are often indicators of compromise. The repetition might just be normal for certain processes that retry operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some unusual points, the overall activities seem related to Office updates and temporary file handling, which aren't inherently suspicious when considered together.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activity involving Excel and Office package updates.

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events where \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in the same path but different filenames. The file paths end with .js files under the OfflineFiles directory. Since these are JavaScript files being created, it could be part of normal Office operations, maybe loading some resources or scripts. But having so many files being created by the same process might raise a flag. It's possible that this is legitimate, but repeated writes could indicate something malicious trying to establish persistence or modifying files frequently.\n\nNext, there are events from \"chrome.exe\" related to image loading and registry changes. The first one loads urlmon.dll, which is a standard Windows DLL used for URL handling. That seems normal. However, the second event where chrome.exe sets a registry value could be interesting. Registry modifications can indicate malicious activity because attackers often create or modify registry entries to maintain persistence or control system behavior. But in this case, it's just setting a value, which might not necessarily be badâ€”it could be Chrome adjusting some settings.\n\nThen there are events from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory. This is likely the agent writing its configuration files or logs. Unless there's something unusual about the filename or path, this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the Excel event, it's just starting up and opening a specific .xlsx file. The image load for combase.dll is normal as well since that's part of COM initialization in Windows. No red flags here.\n\nAnother SDXHelper.exe event shows it creating files under a different package GUID but same structure. This reinforces the idea that this process might be generating multiple script files, possibly during an Office update or feature usage.\n\nPutting it all together, most events seem benignâ€”normal file creation by legitimate processes like Chrome and Excel, along with log agent activities. However, the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe could warrant closer attention. While it's possible these are legitimate updates or cache files, the volume might indicate something more nefarious. Additionally, the registry change in chrome.exe is worth monitoring to ensure it's not part of a larger malicious pattern.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events aren't suspicious, the combinationâ€”especially the repeated file writes by SDXHelper.exe and potential registry tamperingâ€”suggests possible malicious behavior.

I'm looking at each event one by one and trying to see if there's any pattern or signs of malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events are related to Excel.exe. Specifically, there are multiple entries where Excel is loading images from various system directories like System32 and Microsoft.NET folders. That seems normal because Excel would need to load these DLLs to function properly. The tasks mentioned, like Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad), are typical for a running application.\n\nThere's also an event where Excel creates a file in the Downloads folder, \"~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\". This looks like a temporary file that Excel might create when opening or saving a document. Then, there's another event where this file is deleted. File creation and deletion are common actions for applications handling files, so I don't see any red flags here.\n\nAnother point of interest is the Pipe Created event from Excel.exe. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, which is standard in Windows applications, especially when dealing with other services or components. Again, nothing unusual there.\n\nLooking at the events involving svchost.exe setting registry values multiple times could be a bit concerning because svchost is often associated with system services and sometimes malware might misuse it. However, in this case, since the task is \"Registry value set\" without any indication of unauthorized access or unexpected changes, I'm not too worried.\n\nThe two events from SDXHelper.exe creating files also stand out. This process is part of Microsoft Office's Solution Packages, which are legitimate and used to enhance features like editing and collaboration in Office documents. The file paths point to JavaScript resources, which again seems normal for such helper processes.\n\nI should consider whether these activities could indicate malicious behavior. For example, repeated registry changes or unexpected file operations might be signs of something nefarious. However, all the events here align with standard Excel and system operations. There's no evidence of access to unusual files, failed login attempts, or other indicators that would suggest unauthorized activity.\n\nMoreover, the events are spread out over various timestamps, which suggests normal operation rather than a concentrated attack. The lack of any alerts or higher-level tasks like network connections or process injection makes it less likely these logs point to malicious intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while some processes might raise an eyebrow individually, collectively they don't present a cohesive pattern of malicious behavior.

The other events involve \"EXCEL.EXE\" performing DNS queries.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft Defender for Office Apps, which handles real-time scanning and other security features. Its activity includes downloading necessary files like strings and UI components, especially when working offline. So the repeated file creations by SDXHelper.exe are normal during setup or updates.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE DNS queries might be part of standard Excel operations, such as checking online content or updates. These aren't unusual unless they resolve to malicious domains, which isn't indicated here.\n\nI don't see any signs of anomalies like failed logins, access to restricted files, or activities outside the user's typical behavior.

I think that's related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of their update or language package management. These events show multiple file creations, each with a unique path ending in .js files. The repeated patterns in the file paths suggest they might be language-specific strings for different regions, like es-mx for Mexican Spanish, et-ee for Estonian, etc.\n\nLooking at the timestamps isn't possible here, but if these were created within a short timeframe, it could indicate an update or installation process.

Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nFirst, there are a bunch of events where the process name is \"EXCEL.EXE\" and the Windows log task is \"Registry value set\". That seems repetitiveâ€”like 20 times or so. Usually, I know that when an application writes to the registry, it's normal for things like Excel to do that during startup or configuration. So maybe this isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there are some events where the process name is null and the task is \"None\". Those don't seem to add much; they might just be noise or placeholders in the log data without any real significance.\n\nAfter that, I see two events involving \"SDXHelper.exe\". The tasks here are \"File created\", and the files being created have paths within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. Specifically, the file path is something like \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\" which looks legitimate. SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar; I think it's related to Microsoft Office services or perhaps some kind of update helper.\n\nPutting this all together: The Excel-related events are a lot but not unusual, and the SDXHelper ones seem within expected behavior. Thereâ€™s no indication of any malicious activity like unauthorized access, failed logins, or writes to sensitive areas. No file deletions, network connections to unknown domains, or other red flags.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because nothing here stands out as malicious or unusual beyond normal application behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal Excel operations and Microsoft Office helper processes, showing no signs of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Each event is a file creation task, and the same process name and similar file paths repeat multiple times. I notice that each file has different language codes like fr-fr, ga-ie, gd-gb, etc., which suggests these are localized resource files.\n\nThe first six events show the same pattern: SDXHelper.exe creating files in the same structure but with varying language strings. This repetition makes me think it's part of a normal process, perhaps during an Office update or installation where multiple language packs are being set up.\n\nThen there are two more entries of SDXHelper.exe doing similar file creations, and finally, one event from \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file in the Downloads directory. This seems unrelated to the previous events and might just be the log collection tool setting up its own files.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe is notable, it doesn't seem unusual if this process is part of legitimate Office operations. The fact that each file corresponds to a different language pack supports the idea that this is a standard activity rather than malicious behavior. The last event involving winlogbeat is also likely benign as it's related to log shipping tools.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there's no clear indication of malicious activity or anything out of the ordinary beyond normal system operations.

This seems like normal Excel activity when it writes to the registry for configuration settings. Since Excel often does this, I don't see an immediate red flag here.\n\nThen, switching to \"SDXHelper.exe\", which creates several files in specific paths. These look like JavaScript files related to Office's user interface strings. They have filenames with hashes and are stored under the Microsoft Office Solution Packages directory. This seems legitimate because such helper processes often handle updates or language pack installations.\n\nHowever, I notice that some file creation events repeat the same path and filename multiple times. That might indicate an issue like a loop or redundant process, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.

So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My task is to analyze all these together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them involve \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in specific paths. The file paths are variations like \"it-it-ui-strings-json_db31d8ed8da6ede686f40face8f6c2e7.js\" and others with different language codes such as ja-jp, ka-ge, etc. These seem to be strings resources for the Office application, possibly related to language packs or UI translations.\n\nI notice that each file creation event is repeated twice, except maybe one at the end which has null values. So \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating these files multiple times. I know SDXHelper is a legitimate process from Microsoft used for managing Office Solution Packages. It handles things like add-ins and templates. So file creations by this process in its own directories are normal during setup or updates.\n\nThen there are events from \"EXCEL.EXE\" doing DNS queries and registry operations. That's also within the expected behavior, especially if Excel is checking online resources or updating settings via the registry.\n\nThe other events involve \"svchost.exe,\" which is a common system process that hosts various services. Registry modifications by svchost are standard and not unusual unless they're accessing unexpected locations or making multiple changes quickly.\n\nLooking at all these together, there's no indication of anything out of place. The repeated file creations could be part of a bulk operation during an Office update or installation. No signs of failed attempts, access to restricted areas, or known malicious activity patterns. Also, the fact that each event is consistent and follows expected naming conventions for language files makes it less suspicious.\n\nI also check if there are any anomalies like unexpected process combinations, file paths leading to executable files instead of static resources, or timestamps indicating unusual timing (like late at night). There's nothing here pointing towards such red flags.\n\nSo putting it all together, while each event on its own might be notable for someone new, the combination doesn't raise any red flags. They seem like legitimate operations by known Microsoft processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal file creation activities from legitimate Microsoft processes (SDXHelper.exe and EXCEL.EXE) related to Office language resources, with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event looks like.\n\nFirst, there are two events from \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is \"File created\", and the file path points to some JavaScript resource in an Office package. That seems normal because applications often create or access files when running, especially for things like language resources or configuration files. I don't see any red flags here immediately.\n\nThen, there are a lot of events from \"EXCEL.EXE\". Specifically, these events are about registry value sets. There are 24 such entries, all coming from Excel. Now, Excel is a common application, so it's not unusual for it to interact with the Windows Registry for settings or preferences. However, 24 instances in one batch seem like a lot.\n\nI should consider what normal behavior looks like. Applications typically set a few registry values when they start up or configure themselves. If an attacker is using Excel as a vector, maybe through macros or malicious scripts, they might cause more frequent writes to the registry. But without additional context, such as unusual file accesses or network activity, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes legitimate updates or configurations can cause multiple registry changes. It depends on what those specific registry keys are. If Excel is being used normally, these could just be standard operations.\n\nI also notice that after the initial two events from SDXHelper.exe, all others are from Excel and involve registry writes. There's no network activity mentioned in any of these logs, so it doesn't seem like data exfiltration or communication with external servers, which would be a bigger red flag.\n\nSo, putting this together: while multiple registry writes can sometimes indicate malicious behavior, especially if they're frequent or come from unexpected processes, here we have a high volume but all from a common application. There's no evidence of other suspicious actions in the logs provided. Therefore, it might not be an immediate cause for concern unless there are additional indicators elsewhere.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show any clear signs of malicious activity beyond what could be normal operation. However, the number of registry writes is high enough that I'm not entirely sure. Maybe if these logs were part of a larger dataset showing other anomalies, it would be more concerning.\n\nSo, my justification is that while multiple registry writes can be suspicious, in this case, they all come from Excel and don't indicate any malicious activity beyond normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation by a helper process and frequent registry updates by Excel.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one to see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, most of the events are from \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in various paths under the user's AppData directory. These file creation tasks seem repetitive, with multiple entries for the same process and similar file paths. The filenames look like they might be localized strings for different languages, based on the country codes in their names, such as \"en-us_web\", \"mi-nz-ui-strings-json\", etc.\n\nThen there's one event from \"EXCEL.EXE\" where a registry value was set. That could be normal if it's part of Excel's operation, like setting preferences or add-ins.\n\nNow, thinking about what might indicate malicious activity: repeated file creations by the same process, especially in areas like AppData, can sometimes be signs of suspicious behavior. But in this case, since these files are under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and have predictable naming conventions related to UI strings, they might actually be legitimate updates or components loaded by Excel add-ins or other office solutions.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE event is also normal if it's just setting registry values for configuration purposes. There's no indication here of any unusual access patterns or permissions changes that would raise a red flag.\n\nI don't see any signs of file deletions, modifications to sensitive areas beyond the user's AppData, or attempts to execute these files immediately after creation. The repetition seems more like part of a standard process rather than an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\nSo considering all events together, they appear to be part of normal Office operations without any clear indicators of compromise. Therefore, I wouldn't classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by the SDXHelper.exe process and Excel, which appear to be part of normal Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of JSONL events to analyze. Let me take a closer look. Each line is a separate JSON object representing an event.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that all three events have the same \"process\" name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it suggests that these are related activities from the same process. \n\nLooking at the \"winlog\" field, each event has the task as \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". So, this indicates that files were created. The exact file paths point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. Specifically, the paths are:\n\n- nb-no-ui-strings-json_9fd664616fc08c889151a4d9d2e68d08.js\n- ne-np-ui-strings-json_b754f06fbc4336a5d5ce70e8a18358e8.js\n\nThese filenames look like they might be part of some language package or localized resources, given the \"nb-no\" and \"ne-np\" which could stand for Norwegian BokmÃ¥l and Nepali, respectively. \n\nNow, considering that these are file creation events from a legitimate Office process, it's possible that this is normal behavior during an update or installation of language packs. Microsoft Office often updates its resources, especially when dealing with different regional settings.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the possibility of malicious activity. Could \"SDXHelper.exe\" be a known malware? From what I recall, SDXHelper is associated with legitimate Windows processes related to system diagnostics and updates. It's part of the Microsoft Diagnostics infrastructure, so it doesn't raise red flags on its own.\n\nThe repeated creation of these files in the same location by the same process might indicate that this is a routine update or cache activity. Since all three events are identical except for one line being duplicated, it could be an indication of script execution creating multiple files, perhaps due to a loop or a batch process handling different language resources.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any reason this would be suspicious. Maybe if the file paths were in unexpected locations or the filenames looked like exploit code, but these seem benign. The fact that they're within the Office SolutionPackages suggests it's part of Microsoft's own setup.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes attackers might use legitimate processes for malicious activities. But without more context, such as unusual timestamps, multiple failed attempts, or deviations from normal patterns, it's hard to say. \n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activity seems routine and related to Office updates or resource installations. The confidence is high in this assessment because SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, and the file paths align with typical Microsoft package structures.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show files being created by a legitimate Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe), likely part of normal update or resource installation activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
