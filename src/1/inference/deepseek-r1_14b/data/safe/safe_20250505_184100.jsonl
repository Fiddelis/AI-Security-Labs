This seems suspicious because an update process creating links to Discord might be trying to establish persistence or create shortcuts for malicious purposes.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad tasks from Discord.exe, which is normal since it's a legitimate application loading its DLLs. However, combined with the Update.exe activity, I'm concerned about potential unauthorized changes to the system.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nThe first event is the creation of DiscordSetup.exe being run. That seems normal because people often download and install Discord. The second event shows that the image was loaded, which again is typical during installation.\n\nNext, there's a file created in SquirrelTemp for Update.exe. I know Squirrel is related to updates for applications like Discord, so this might be part of its update process.\n\nThe subsequent events are all about Update.exe being accessed and loaded with various DLLs. These seem like standard operations for an application needing to run and access system libraries. There's nothing unusual here that stands out as malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a config file. That makes sense if it's the log gathering tool itself running.\n\nThe multiple ProcessAccess events on Update.exe might seem suspicious at first glance because repeated accesses could indicate something nefarious. However, considering the context of Discord's update process, these are likely legitimate activities as part of the software's normal operation to check for updates or apply them.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual file creations outside expected locations, nor are there any failed processes or errors that might indicate tampering or attacks. All the files involved are within standard user directories and known system paths.\n\nIn summary, while the volume of events is notable, each event falls under normal behavior for a user installing and running Discord with its update mechanism.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are all in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. Each event contains details about a process, a Windows log task, and sometimes a file path.\n\nStarting with the first event: It's an update.exe loading clrjit.dll. That seems normal for system processes; .NET Framework components are standard. No red flags here.\n\nThe next events are all related to Discord.exe. The tasks vary from Process Create, Image Load, Pipe Created, to accessing other processes or files. For example, there are multiple instances of Discord being created with different command lines and parameters. This looks like Discord launching various processes, including GPU processes and network services, which is typical for a running application.\n\nLooking at the file paths: The events mention loading Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll from standard locations within the user's AppData folder. These are legitimate files used by Discord for its operations, so nothing suspicious there.\n\nI notice that some events don't have file information, while others specify files being loaded or created. For example, Update.exe creates a shortcut in the Start Menu, which is normal behavior for an installer or updater to add entries to the start menu.\n\nAnother point: The events show multiple accesses and creations of processes related to Discord and Update.exe. However, these actions are consistent with Discord's normal operation—launching different components, accessing files, and updating shortcuts. There’s no evidence of unusual file operations, network activity, or access to unexpected locations that would indicate malicious behavior.\n\nThe command lines for Discord.exe include various flags like --type=gpu-process and --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService. These are standard parameters used by Discord to manage its processes and services, which align with known behaviors of the application.\n\nConsidering the volume of events—there are 18 in total—it might seem high, but given that they're all from a single application (Discord) performing normal operations, it's not unusual. The repetition is expected as part of Discord's process initialization and management.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies like unexpected file writes to system directories, use of administrative privileges without reason, or calls to external domains. However, in this batch, all files are within the user’s AppData, which is a standard location for application data, and there are no signs of communication with external servers or unusual network activities logged here.\n\nThere's an event where Update.exe creates a file path ending with \"Discord Inc\", but that seems to be creating a start menu shortcut, which again is normal. The repeated access of processes by Update.exe could indicate it's part of the update process, ensuring Discord is running correctly post-update.\n\nIn summary, all events are consistent with Discord running normally and an updater script (Update.exe) performing standard tasks like updating shortcuts and accessing necessary files. There’s no indication of any malicious activity or unusual system calls that would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are normal process operations related to Discord and an updater script, with no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events from a user's machine. The events are in JSONL format, with each line being a separate JSON object. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\n1. The first event shows \"Update.exe\" being accessed with a ProcessAccess rule. This might be normal if it's part of an update process.\n2. Next, Discord.exe is started with some command line arguments for installation. It's flagged under ProcessCreate. Since Discord is a legitimate application, this seems okay unless the arguments look suspicious. The arguments here seem standard for Discord updates or installations.\n3. Again, Update.exe is accessed, which could be related to the Discord update process.\n4. Discord.exe loads an image (app-1.0.9190\/Discord.exe) under ImageLoad. This is typical when an application starts up.\n5. It also loads ffmpeg.dll, which is a common library for video and audio processing, so that's normal.\n6. A pipe was created by Discord.exe, which might be for inter-process communication; nothing unusual here.\n7. Another ProcessCreate event for Discord.exe with more command line parameters. This seems to be Discord starting in a specific mode or handling crash reports (crashpad-handler). The presence of --url and other flags looks legitimate for its operation.\n8. Again, Discord.exe is accessed under ProcessAccess. Could be part of the update or running processes.\n9. More ImageLoad events loading Discord.exe and ffmpeg.dll, which are standard.\n10. Multiple Pipe Created events by Discord.exe. These might be internal communication pipes between different parts of the application, which is normal.\n11. Update.exe creates a shortcut for Discord.exe. This is typical during software installations or updates to create entries in the start menu or desktop.\n12. Finally, several ImageLoad events for Update.exe and some system DLLs. These are expected when running executables that might require .NET framework components.\n\nLooking at all these events together, I don't see any red flags. The activities seem consistent with Discord updating itself or launching its processes normally. There's nothing like failed login attempts, access to unexpected files, or network connections that would raise concerns. All the processes and file accesses are within the expected behavior of a legitimate application update.\n\nI should also consider if there's anything unusual in the frequency of events. There are multiple instances where Update.exe is being accessed or Discord starts with different parameters. However, given that it's an update process, this makes sense over a period of time as the software checks for updates and deploys them.\n\nAdditionally, checking for any anomalies like unknown file paths or external domains in URLs: all the paths point to local directories (e.g., AppData), and the URL provided is 'https:\/\/f.a.k\/e', which seems like it might be an internal server or part of Discord's infrastructure. There’s no indication of malicious domains or unusual network activity.\n\nThe command lines also don't show anything suspicious. For example, --squirrel-install suggests it's using Squirrel for updates, which is a known package manager by Microsoft. The crashpad-handler indicates it's dealing with crash reports, which is standard for applications to improve stability.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own could warrant attention if taken out of context, the combination here appears to be part of Discord's legitimate update and installation process. There are no signs of malicious activities like unauthorized access, strange file creations, or network exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events correspond to normal application behavior, specifically the Discord application updating and launching its processes with standard activities such as process creation, image loading, and pipe creation.

The output should be a single JSON result with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, let me look through each event to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few lines show Discord.exe processes being created and accessing or terminating. Then there are events involving reg.exe modifying the registry. For example:\n- Line 2: reg.exe adding a value under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord\n- Line 7: Another reg.exe command setting up an open command for Discord.\n\nI notice that these are legitimate Windows commands, but I wonder if they're part of some malicious activity. Modifying the registry to change how Discord is associated with files could be normal during setup, but it might also be a sign of something else.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple process creations and terminations of Discord.exe, along with image loads and file accesses. These seem like standard operations for an application launch and updates. \n\nLine 14 has Update.exe creating a shortcut in the Start Menu, which is typical during software installation or updates. Then there are several ProcessAccess events for Update.exe, which again seems normal if it's interacting with other processes.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's any pattern indicating malicious behavior. For instance, repeated process creations\/terminations without a clear purpose could be suspicious, but here they're tied to Discord and its update mechanism.\n\nThe use of reg.exe is common for legitimate purposes, like setting application associations or shortcuts. However, it's also a tool that attackers might misuse, so I need to check the command lines carefully.\n\nLooking at line 2: The command sets the default icon for Discord. It seems straightforward but uses escaped quotes and paths, which is normal in such commands. Line 7 modifies the shell open command to include --url and %%1, which are parameters for handling URLs or files, so that also looks legitimate if part of the application's setup.\n\nI don't see any signs of known malicious activity like unusual file creation, access to restricted areas, or irregular network connections. All events point towards Discord's normal operations, possibly during an update or initial setup.\n\nThe confidence level: Since all activities can be explained as part of Discord running and updating itself, without indicators of compromise (like writing to unexpected locations or using known malicious tools), the confidence is low that this batch is malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal operations involving Discord.exe, reg.exe, and Update.exe for process creation, registry modifications, and file handling.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's see what each event shows.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from \"Update.exe\" accessing processes and creating files. For example, one event has a file path pointing to \"Discord.lnk\". That seems suspicious because it's an .lnk file, which can be used in malicious activities like shortcut spoofing or as part of ransomware.\n\nBut then, looking further, I notice other events from Discord-related processes like \"Discord.exe\" and \"DiscordSetup.exe\", including command-line arguments. These are normal for Discord since it's a legitimate application with its own setup and crash handler processes. The creation of pipes by Discord might be part of inter-process communication, which is typical.\n\nThe presence of Update.exe accessing files and registry values could be concerning, but without more context, like unusual behavior or multiple failed attempts, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. However, the combination with Discord's legitimate processes makes me think that maybe this is just regular activity after an update or installation.\n\nAlso, I don't see any signs of data exfiltration, encryption, or other clear indicators of a breach. The events are consistent with normal software operations, even though some actions by Update.exe could be red flags if isolated. But since they're part of a larger batch that includes legitimate processes, it might not be malicious.\n\nSo overall, while there are elements that could raise an eyebrow, without more context or clear signs of compromise, the batch doesn't seem to require immediate investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be related to normal process creation and termination activities, including legitimate software like Discord.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_184100.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of system log events to analyze. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are related to \"Update.exe\" and \"Discord.exe\". For example, there are multiple entries where Update.exe is accessing processes and files, like creating a file on the desktop: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Desktop\\Discord.lnk. That's interesting because it seems like Update.exe is interacting with Discord-related files.\n\nThen, I notice several events involving reg.exe commands. These look like they're modifying the Windows Registry. For instance, one event shows reg.exe adding a value to HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the key \"Discord\" and the data pointing to the Update.exe path including Discord.exe as a process start. That's a bit concerning because it looks like they're setting up an autorun entry for Discord, which could be legitimate but sometimes attackers use registry modifications to maintain persistence.\n\nThere are also events where reg.exe is adding entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes for \"Discord\" and \"URL Protocol\". This seems like the creation of a custom protocol handler. If I'm not mistaken, this would allow Discord to handle URL links starting with their protocol, which could be normal but can also be used maliciously if it's part of a social engineering attack or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe events involving \"Pipe Created\" under Discord.exe are also worth noting. Named pipes are often used for inter-process communication. While legitimate applications use them, attackers might as well to establish a backdoor or command and control channels. However, in this case, since it's Discord, which is known to use such mechanisms internally, it might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ProcessCreate events for reg.exe. Each time reg.exe runs with specific commands to modify the registry. This could indicate some automation or script running multiple times, trying to set up these registry entries. If I were investigating, I'd check if these modifications are happening at unusual times or in an unprivileged context.\n\nAlso, there's a ProcessTerminate event for Update.exe, which ends its execution after several accesses. It might be part of the update process completing normally, but combined with other events, it could raise flags.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple registry writes to set up autorun and protocol handlers, plus named pipe creations, especially when initiated from an external script or process (like Update.exe), can indicate potential malicious activity. The repeated use of reg.exe commands suggests automation, possibly by a script meant to persist the system after reboot, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there's a combination of activities that could be part of legitimate operations (like software updates or normal Discord behavior), but the specific registry modifications and multiple process creations with reg.exe are red flags often seen in attacks. The confidence level is high, maybe around 0.85, because while some events might not be malicious on their own, together they form a pattern that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple registry modifications and file creation activities by Update.exe and reg.exe, which could indicate potential malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, all these events are related to Discord.exe processes. The first log shows a process creation with some command line arguments. It looks like Discord is starting with specific flags, including GPU process type and user data directory. Then there are subsequent logs about accessing the process, loading images (DLLs), creating pipes, and so on.\n\nI notice that all these events are standard operations for a Discord client. When you start Discord, it creates processes, loads various DLLs like ffmpeg for media handling, and establishes pipes for inter-process communication. The command-line arguments seem normal too; they're specifying things like GPU preferences, disabling certain features, and handling network services.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. No unusual file accesses, no strange network connections mentioned, and all the loaded modules are expected for a Discord installation. Even though there are multiple events, they all fit within the normal behavior of the application starting up and running.\n\nSo putting it all together, this batch doesn't indicate anything suspicious.

Then, there are multiple image load events for the main executable and ffmpeg.dll, which is common for Discord since it handles audio and video.\n\nI notice several Pipe Created events, which are typical when applications create named pipes for interprocess communication. That doesn't raise any red flags on its own.\n\nThen, I see reg.exe being used to add registry entries under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord. Specifically, they're setting the URL Protocol and DefaultIcon values. This looks like Discord is registering itself as a protocol handler, which is standard behavior for applications wanting to handle their own URLs (like discord:\/\/ links). The command lines are straightforward and match expected behavior.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activities here. No unexpected file accesses, network connections, or unusual process interactions.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the logs start with an event involving `reg.exe`. It's being used to add a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord\\shell\\open\\command. The command line shows that it's setting the default value to point to Discord's executable path. This is pretty standard for creating a custom protocol handler, so on its own, this might not be suspicious.\n\nNext, I notice multiple events from `Discord.exe`. It starts with a Process Create event, which is normal when an application launches. Then there are several entries of Network connection detections and Dns queries. Discord being a communication app would naturally make network connections to servers, so these aren't unusual.\n\nLooking deeper, there's a Pipe Created event, more registry accesses, and file operations like loading ffmpeg.dll and some temporary files related to unpacking. These activities are typical for an application like Discord, which might involve multimedia processing and background tasks.\n\nI'm also checking if there are any signs of malicious behavior, such as unusual file accesses, multiple failed attempts, or processes running with elevated privileges. Everything here seems within the expected behavior for Discord—launching, accessing resources, making network connections, and handling files related to its operation.\n\nSince all these events align with what Discord is known to do during normal operations, there's no indication of any malicious activity or anomalies in this batch of logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to the Discord application performing normal operations such as launching, accessing resources, and making network connections.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

All these events are related to Discord.exe processes and some other activities on a Windows system. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve Discord.exe accessing files or processes multiple times. For example, there are several \"Process accessed\" tasks. That in itself might not be too concerning if it's just normal operations, but I should check for anything unusual.\n\nThere's also a File Created event where a .lnk file is being created on the Desktop and another one in the Start Menu Programs folder. These are shortcut files, so maybe someone is setting up a quick launch for Discord. But again, that might be normal unless it's part of some malicious activity.\n\nThen there are Pipe Created events. Pipes can be used for interprocess communication. A lot of these could mean that Discord is communicating with other processes or services, which might be legitimate, especially if Discord runs in the background or integrates with other apps.\n\nThe standout event here is where reg.exe is used to modify the registry. The command line shows adding a new value under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Discord with the name \"URL:Discord Protocol\". This looks like it's setting up a protocol handler for Discord, so that when you click on a Discord link, it opens in the app.\n\nPutting this all together, what stands out is the use of reg.exe to modify the registry. That could be part of legitimate setup steps for an application, but it's also something that malware might do to create persistence or install hooks. The combination of multiple process accesses and file creations along with a registry modification makes me think there's potential for investigation.\n\nI'm not seeing any overt signs of malicious activity like failed logins, access to sensitive files, or network connections in the provided data. But the registry change is significant because it could indicate an attempt to integrate Discord more deeply into system operations, which might be suspicious depending on the context.\n\nSince there's a mix of normal and potentially concerning activities, I'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING but with moderate confidence. The justification would focus on the unusual registry modification alongside repeated process accesses.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple events related to Discord.exe accessing processes and files, along with a suspicious use of reg.exe to modify the Windows Registry by adding a new protocol handler.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the logs are all in JSONL format, each line a separate event. The events involve Discord.exe, which is the Discord client application. That makes me think these could be normal operations since Discord is a communication platform that often connects to networks and interacts with system resources.\n\nLooking at the individual events:\n\n1. Most of them have \"Network connection detected\" with the rule NetworkConnect. This suggests that Discord is establishing network connections, which it does regularly for sending messages, receiving data, and maintaining presence online. So multiple instances of this are expected and not necessarily suspicious on their own.\n\n2. There's one event where a process was terminated (ProcessTerminate). Again, applications often terminate processes as part of normal shutdown or updates. Without additional context, this doesn't raise red flags.\n\n3. Another event shows a registry value being set (RegistryEvent). Applications often modify the Windows Registry during installation, configuration, or runtime. This is a common activity for software to function properly.\n\nThe repetition of similar events—like multiple network connections and process terminations—is consistent with Discord's behavior. There are no indicators here that point to malicious activities such as unusual file accesses, failed login attempts, or unexpected registry modifications that could indicate tampering or malware.\n\nI also don't see any deviations from the norm in terms of frequency. The number of events doesn't seem abnormally high for a running Discord instance, which typically connects to servers and might have several network interactions over time.\n\nSince all these activities are within the expected behavior of Discord.exe, there's no compelling reason to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation. They don't indicate any potential security incidents or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal operations of the Discord.exe process, including expected network connections and registry interactions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
