I notice that many of these file paths are duplicates, meaning the same files are being created twice each. That could indicate something suspicious, but it's also possible that this is part of normal software updates or cache activities.\n\nI'm thinking about whether SDXHelper.exe is a known malicious process. From what I recall, Microsoft Office sometimes uses helper processes for various tasks, including dealing with Solution Packages and Offline Files. These are usually legitimate parts of the Office suite to handle features like Copilot.\n\nThe pattern here shows multiple identical files being created in quick succession. Malicious actors might do this as part of a file injection or persistence technique, but it's also common for legitimate software updates where multiple resources are being written to disk.\n\nI'm not seeing any overt signs of malicious activity here—like writes to unexpected locations, attempts to execute code, or network communications that seem off. The repetition could be normal if the system is retrying operations or handling a large number of files as part of an update.\n\nGiven all this, while the repeated identical file creations are notable, they don't necessarily indicate malicious intent without more context.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSON structure, each line represents an event with three main components: process details, Windows log information, and file path details. The process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" in all cases, which I'm not immediately familiar with. The task is consistently a \"File created\" event triggered by the rule \"FileCreate.\" Each event points to the creation of a JavaScript file located in a specific directory under the user's AppData folder.\n\nHmm, so the same process is creating multiple files. The file paths are all within an Office-related package path: \"...\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\\\\...\". This suggests these might be part of an Office add-in or component, possibly related to features like Copilot in Excel given the filenames include \"excel-copilot.\"\n\nI know that Office applications often use such packages for additional functionality. The files being created are JavaScript files with long GUID-like names. This pattern could indicate normal operation as Office updates its components or loads new resources.\n\nHowever, since all events involve the same process and similar file paths, it's possible these are legitimate activities. But I should consider whether multiple identical events within a short time frame might be suspicious. Maybe an attacker is trying to create several files quickly, but in this case, it seems like each event is unique with different filenames.\n\nAnother point: \"SDXHelper.exe\" – I need to check if that's a known legitimate process or something commonly associated with malware. A quick mental note tells me that I haven't heard of this being malicious. It sounds more like a helper tool, possibly for handling data or updates within Office applications.\n\nThe justification provided by the assistant earlier noted that multiple identical events might be suspicious but didn't find evidence of malicious intent. Since all file creations are under a standard user directory and part of known Microsoft structures, it's less likely to be an attack.\n\nI also think about how sometimes legitimate processes create multiple files quickly, especially during software updates or initial setup. It's plausible that these events are part of the normal operation when Excel or another Office app is being used with Copilot features.\n\nSo putting this together: the same process creating several JavaScript files in a standard directory likely isn't malicious. There's no indication of access to sensitive areas, use of elevated privileges beyond what's expected for an office application, or unusual patterns like file deletions or modifications after creation.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because these events appear to be part of normal Office operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by a known legitimate process within expected directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I'm given a bunch of log events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event, and they all seem similar. The first thing I notice is that the process name is \"SDXHelper.exe\" every time. That caught my attention because I know that .exe files are typically executable programs, so any process named something like this could be legitimate or malicious.\n\nLooking at the task in each log entry, it's always a file creation event under the rule \"FileCreate\". So the system is logging that a file was created by this process. The file paths all point to the same directory but have different filenames with varying hash-like strings. For example, one file is named \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_bc27bc578cb830e5653d09d0c94a6030.js\", and another is \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_c3a1e3c4beadd5c7adc87ffe9417c8cf.js\". The pattern in the filenames suggests they might be different versions or instances of a JavaScript file related to Excel's Copilot feature.\n\nI'm wondering why there are multiple files being created with similar names. Could this be part of a legitimate process, like downloading and caching resources for an Office add-in? I know that Microsoft Office often uses such mechanisms to store offline files for features like Copilot. Alternatively, it might indicate some form of persistence or malicious activity if the same file is being written multiple times.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that each event has a unique file path ending with a different hash. This repetition makes me think: how common is it for legitimate software to create multiple similar files in this manner? If \"SDXHelper.exe\" is associated with Microsoft Office, as the path suggests (it's under Microsoft\/Office), then these could be normal operations.\n\nI also need to consider the user context. The username in each log is \"fiddelis\", which doesn't seem suspicious on its own but ties all events to a single user account. If this were a breach, I might expect activity across multiple users or more varied process names.\n\nLooking for patterns: all events are file creation tasks by the same process, under the same directory structure. The frequency here is high—14 events in total—but without knowing the baseline of what's normal for this system, it's hard to say if that's unusual. If \"SDXHelper.exe\" usually creates several files periodically, then this might not be concerning.\n\nI should also check whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known process. From my knowledge, SDXHelper is related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of the Click-to-Run deployment. It's used for managing Office add-ins and their resources. So in that case, creating multiple files under the SolutionPackages directory would be normal as it's handling offline content.\n\nHowever, the fact that each file path ends with a hash could also raise an eyebrow. Malware often uses such naming conventions to avoid detection or to generate unique filenames for dropped files. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell definitively.\n\nAnother angle: repeated identical events. In this case, some of the files are created twice. For instance, \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_c3a1e3c4beadd5c7adc87ffe9417c8cf.js\" appears twice. Maybe it's a retry mechanism or an error in the process.\n\nI should also think about how such files would be used. JavaScript files could contain legitimate code for Office features, but if they were malicious, they might execute scripts that compromise security. However, again, given the context of Microsoft Office and the naming structure, it seems more likely to be part of a legitimate update or caching process.\n\nIn summary, while there are some red flags like multiple file creations by the same process and unique filenames with hash-like endings, these could all fit within normal operations for an Office-related helper process. Without additional indicators of compromise (like changes in file content, execution of scripts, or network communication), it's difficult to classify this as malicious.\n\nTherefore, considering that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process and the file paths align with Microsoft Office structures, I would lean towards these events being non-interesting from a security perspective. However, if there were more unusual attributes like access times spread out over suspicious intervals or attempts to execute these files, it might warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are likely related to legitimate Office operations involving file creation by a known Microsoft Office process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

Let me break down each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, all the events are from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because malicious actors often use legitimate-sounding process names. But is SDXHelper.exe known for something suspicious? I'm not sure off the top of my head, so I'll need to consider that as part of the analysis.\n\nNext, each event is a file creation task according to \"winlog\". So, the system is logging that files were created. The paths are all under the user's AppData directory, specifically within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles folders. This seems related to how Office handles add-ins or solution packages, possibly for features like Copilot in Excel.\n\nLooking at the file names, they have consistent naming patterns with long GUID-like hashes: \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier_...\" followed by different hex strings each time. It looks like these are JavaScript files being created. The fact that multiple files are being created repeatedly might indicate some kind of update or cache activity.\n\nI notice that each file path is unique except for the last part, which changes each time. There's a pattern where some files are created twice, like the one ending with \"ed0f81df2df8abb3b0b6638af771e2ed.js\" appears once and then again, but it might just be normal caching behavior.\n\nNow, considering potential malicious activity: If an attacker is using SDXHelper.exe to create files in the AppData directory, they could be dropping malware. However, in this case, all the files are JavaScript files under a known Microsoft Office structure. That makes me think these are legitimate files being created by an update or installation process.\n\nAnother angle is that sometimes attackers will generate multiple files with random names as part of their payload to avoid detection. But here, the naming convention aligns more with standard software package structures rather than typical malicious activity. Plus, there's consistency in the file creation times and paths, which doesn't raise red flags like a sudden spike or varied locations.\n\nAlso, since all events are from the same process and in the same directory, it seems like a normal part of how Office handles its add-ins or updates. I don't see any signs of privilege escalation, registry modifications, or other indicators that would make this batch stand out as malicious.\n\nIn summary, while \"SDXHelper.exe\" could potentially be malicious, the context provided by the file paths and names points towards legitimate activity related to Microsoft Office features. Without additional events showing unusual behavior, such as deletions, access patterns, or communication with external domains, there's no strong evidence of malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by the SDXHelper.exe process in a known Microsoft Office directory structure.

Let me break down what I see here.\n\nFirst off, each event is in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. That makes it easy to process one by one if needed, but since the instruction is to analyze the entire batch as a whole, I'll focus on patterns across all events.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have similar structures. The \"process\" field shows that the same executable is involved: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's a red flag because sometimes malicious processes use legitimate-sounding names. But it could also be a normal process depending on what SDXHelper does.\n\nThe \"winlog\" field indicates that each event is related to a file creation task, specifically triggered by a rule named \"FileCreate\". So these are system-generated logs indicating that a new file was created. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious; files get created all the time during normal operations.\n\nNow, looking at the \"file\" path: it's pointing to various JavaScript files located in the Office SolutionPackages directory under the user's AppData folder. The paths have consistent patterns, like \"\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\\" followed by different filenames each time. Each filename seems unique but follows a naming convention with GUID-like strings and version identifiers.\n\nWait a minute, why are there so many similar events? Let me count them. There are 14 entries here, all created by the same process and in the same directory structure. That's a lot of files being created quickly, or perhaps over time. The repetition makes me think—could this be part of a legitimate software update process, like Office installing new resources, or could it be something else?\n\nI recall that sometimes legitimate applications create multiple temporary files during updates or initial setup. For example, Microsoft Office might download and cache various components for features like Copilot. So the filenames containing \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" suggest these are related to Excel's Copilot feature.\n\nBut I'm also cautious because attackers often use such names to blend in with normal processes. However, in this case, all events point to a single process creating files in a known Microsoft directory structure, which makes it more likely that this is part of legitimate software behavior.\n\nAnother angle: could these be indicators of malicious activity? If SDXHelper.exe were malware, it might drop multiple files here. But considering the consistent naming and the fact that they're all under an Office-related folder, it's more plausible that this is a standard operation.\n\nI should also think about the frequency. Creating multiple files in quick succession isn't unusual for updates or installations. If these events happened over a short period, say within minutes, that could be a sign of something malicious, like bulk file creation as part of a payload deployment. But without timestamp data, I can't tell how spread out these events are.\n\nThe paths themselves don't show any signs of being outside the expected directories for user data and software resources. No system32 or other protected areas are involved here. The files are in the AppData Local folder, which is a standard place for application settings and temporary data.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious with process names like SDXHelper.exe (which I'm not immediately familiar with), the context provided by the file paths and the nature of the events suggests these are legitimate file creations related to Microsoft Office features. There's no evidence of deviation from expected behavior, such as writing to unexpected locations or accessing restricted areas.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this batch isn't particularly interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint because it aligns with typical software operations rather than showing signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in expected Microsoft Office directories, likely legitimate.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each line represents an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". All these files are located in the same directory under \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\", which seems to be related to Microsoft Office's solution packages. The filenames all follow a pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" with various GUID-like suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me break it down.\n\n1. **Process Name**: All events are triggered by SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but given the path and context of Microsoft Office, it might be part of an official Office tool or a legitimate helper application. However, sometimes attackers use legitimate-sounding names for their malware.\n\n2. **Event Type**: Each event is a \"File created\" task. So, these are just file creation events. In itself, creating files isn't malicious, but the context matters.\n\n3. **File Paths and Names**: The files being created are under the Office SolutionPackages directory. This suggests they're part of an Office add-in or feature. The naming pattern with \"excel-copilot\" makes me think these might be related to Excel's Copilot feature, which uses JavaScript strings for functionality. However, having multiple identical file creations could indicate something unusual.\n\n4. **Number of Events**: There are 14 events here, all involving the same process creating files in the same location with similar names. This repetition stands out. Legitimate software updates or package installations might create a few files, but 14 exact duplicates seem excessive.\n\n5. **Possible Malicious Indicators**:\n   - Multiple identical file creations could be part of an installation routine, but it's also a common tactic in malware to write multiple files quickly.\n   - The process name being \"SDXHelper.exe\" might not be a standard one, and if it's creating several files in the same location, it could be trying to avoid detection or spread out its components.\n\n6. **Lack of Other Events**: Without additional events like file deletions, network activity, or changes in file permissions, it's hard to say definitively, but the sheer number of identical file creation events is concerning.\n\n7. **Potential Justification for Interest**:\n   - The repetition and exactness of the filenames suggest a possible script or automated process writing multiple files, which could be malicious.\n   - SDXHelper.exe might not be a commonly known legitimate process, especially in this context, raising suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, these could just be legitimate updates or cached resources for an Office add-in. The Copilot feature does involve several JavaScript files, so it's possible these are being downloaded or cached. However, the volume is high enough that it might warrant investigation to ensure they're not part of a malicious payload or persistence mechanism.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of multiple identical file creation events by an unfamiliar process in a sensitive directory raises flags. The confidence isn't too high (maybe 0.6) since there's a possibility it's legitimate, but the indicators are enough to merit closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by an unfamiliar process in a sensitive directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}

The file paths look like they're related to Office add-ins or Copilot strings. These seem repetitive, but I'm not sure if that's normal behavior for this process. It could be part of legitimate operations, especially since Copilot is a feature in Microsoft Office.\n\nThen there are events where \"MdSched.exe\" is creating processes. This process is related to Windows Defender, so it's expected to see its activity. The command line seems standard too, just running the executable from system32.\n\nNext, I see entries for \"consent.exe\" loading AMSI and URLMON DLLs. These are legitimate Windows components used for anti-malware scanning and URL handling. So, this doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThere's also an entry for \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a configuration file in the user's Downloads directory. Since winlogbeat is likely a log management tool, it's normal for it to write its configuration files there.\n\nLooking at all these events together, they seem to be part of standard operations without any signs of malicious activity.

So, I'm looking at these JSONL logs, each line has a process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", a file creation event in Windows log, and the path to some JavaScript files.\n\nFirst, I know that \"SDXHelper.exe\" sounds familiar. It might be related to Microsoft Office add-ins or something similar since it's in the Office directory. The paths under \"PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\" also point towards temporary or cached files used by Office applications, like Excel Copilot strings and vendors for code-preview-dialog.\n\nI see that each event is a file creation.

Let me start by looking at each event one by one.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The common elements across all these events are the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\", the task being \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", and the file path which varies but follows a similar structure.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all seem to be within the \"AppData\" directory of the user's profile. Specifically, they're located in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages folders. The paths include GUIDs like \"8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c\" and \"82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\", which are likely package identifiers. The files being created are JavaScript files, some prefixed with \"vendors~\".\n\nI recognize that Microsoft Office often uses these GUIDs for add-ins or solution packages. The filenames like \"excel-copilot-strings\" and \"vendors~copilotchatdisplay\" suggest they might be related to the Copilot feature in Excel or similar Office applications. These are legitimate files created when using features like AI assistant within Office.\n\nNow, considering that all events have the same process name and task type, it's clear that this is a repeated action of creating files by SDXHelper.exe. This doesn't raise any immediate red flags because such processes are common in application setups or updates.\n\nI don't see any indicators of malicious activity here. The file paths are typical for user-specific application data, and the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" isn't known to be associated with malware.

This repetition suggests that the same process is creating multiple files, possibly during a legitimate operation.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe sounds familiar. A quick mental note: I think this is related to Microsoft Office's SDX (Side by Side Data Exchange) components, which handle things like document conversion or data exchange between different versions of Office.

The task is to determine whether the entire batch is \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" based on these logs.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what each log entry contains. Each line starts with a process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across all events, so it seems like this is a common process generating these logs. The task in the winlog field is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\", which indicates that a file was created. The file paths vary but are all under the same directory structure.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're located in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. This looks like a standard location for Office add-ins or solution packages. The specific subdirectories have GUID-like names, which is typical for package identifiers. The filenames include variations of \"excel-copilot-strings\" and other vendor prefixes like \"vendors~\".\n\nI notice that some files are repeated multiple times.

The file names are related to Excel Copilot strings and vendor resources, which aligns with legitimate Microsoft Office components. There's no indication of any unusual access times, file paths outside the user's profile, or other red flags that might suggest malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether SDXHelper.exe is a known process. A quick mental note: SDXHelper is associated with Microsoft's Solution Accelerators and Data Explorer tools. It's part of legitimate Office components, so seeing it create files in the specified locations isn't unusual.\n\nThe repetitive nature of these events might indicate a batch file creation process, perhaps during an update or synchronization. The duplication could be due to multiple instances or retries of the same operation, which is common in such scenarios.\n\nIn terms of potential malicious behavior, I don't see any signs here.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to classify this batch of events. So, I'm given a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event on a system. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event: Each line has three main parts - process info, winlog details, and file information. The process name in most cases is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The winlog task mentions \"File created\" which indicates that a new file was made. There's also an event where \"MdSched.exe\" set a registry value.\n\nNow, focusing on the file paths. They all seem to be under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages...\", specifically in the OfflineFiles directory. The filenames are variations of \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" with different hashes at the end. This pattern suggests that multiple JavaScript files are being created, each with a unique identifier.\n\nI recall that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is related to Microsoft Office, possibly part of their Office Solution Add-ins. The fact that it's creating several files in the OfflineFiles folder makes sense for an application trying to store or cache data locally. The duplication of some file paths (like having two entries for each hash) might be due to multiple instances or retries.\n\nThe one event where \"MdSched.exe\" sets a registry value is also notable, but I know that MdSched is related to Windows Defender's scheduling mechanism, so it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting this together: The batch shows repeated file creations by a legitimate Office-related process. There doesn't seem to be any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity. All events are consistent with normal operations of the application, possibly during an update or cache refresh.\n\nTherefore, while the volume might seem high, it's not indicative of malicious behavior. Hence, this batch is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by a legitimate Office-related process (SDXHelper.exe) within the expected directory structure.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL logs. Each event has the same process name: \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task is a file creation event for various JavaScript files in specific paths under the user's AppData folder.\n\nFirst, I should consider what SDXHelper.exe is. From what I know, it's part of Microsoft Office, specifically related to Office Add-ins or Solution Packages. These packages are used for storing and managing additional features or resources that Office might use, especially when working offline.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all under the \"Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\" directory, which aligns with my understanding. Each file is named something like \"excel-copilot-strings_...\" or \"vendors~...\", which suggests they are resource files for specific features or add-ins within Office. The repetition of creating these files in different hashes indicates that this might be part of the normal setup or update process of Office, where new resources are being downloaded or cached.\n\nI notice that each event is a file creation by SDXHelper.exe, and all the files are located in standard locations for Office packages. There's nothing unusual about the file names suggesting malicious activity—no executable extensions or known malicious filenames. Also, since these events are repeating multiple times with different hashes but similar naming conventions, it seems consistent with how legitimate software updates or adds new resources.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether such file creation activities are common in a typical Office environment. Since these are part of the Solution Packages, they might be created during initial setup, updates, or when enabling\/disabling features. The fact that multiple files are being created with different hashes could indicate that several resource files are being managed or updated.\n\nI should also think about whether there's any indication of unauthorized access or malicious behavior. There's no evidence here of file deletion, modification outside expected patterns, or signs of external commands (like remote access). All events look like standard file creation tasks associated with legitimate software components.\n\nMoreover, the consistency in the process name and task type across all events suggests a routine operation rather than something suspicious. If these were part of a malicious payload, I might expect varied process names or different types of log entries, such as file deletions or writes to unexpected locations.\n\nI'm also considering whether there's any volume here that stands out. Thirteen events in one batch is a manageable number and doesn't indicate an unusually high activity spike unless this is happening frequently beyond what's expected for the software's operation.\n\nIn summary, all signs point towards these being legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft Office-related process, creating resource files in appropriate locations. There's no evidence of malicious intent or behavior that would require further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation operations by the SDXHelper.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Office Solution Packages.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The process name is consistently \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task in each case is a file creation event, specifically under the rule \"FileCreate\". The files being created are all JavaScript files located in the same path but with different filenames.\n\nHmm, I know that SDXHelper.exe is often associated with Microsoft Office, particularly related to features like Excel's Copilot. These files are probably part of the Copilot functionality, which might be using these JavaScript resources for its operations.\n\nEach event shows a new file being created in the OfflineFiles directory. This suggests that the application is downloading or caching these files as needed. Since all the events are from the same process and follow a similar pattern, it doesn't look suspicious at first glance.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here, like access to restricted areas, repeated failed attempts, or multiple processes accessing the same file in an irregular way.

Each event is a JSON object representing some file creation activity by the process SDXHelper.exe.\n\nFirst, all events show that the same executable (SDXHelper.exe) is creating files in specific paths under the user's AppData directory. The paths are consistent across all entries, with each having unique filenames but following a similar naming pattern like \"excel-copilot-strings_*.js\". This repetition suggests it's part of a legitimate process, possibly related to Office add-ins or cached resources for an application.\n\nI'm considering if these actions are typical or unusual. Since they're all file creations by the same process in a common directory structure, it doesn't raise immediate red flags. Legitimate applications often create and manage files in such locations, especially when dealing with offline content or temporary files.\n\nThere's no evidence of any malicious indicators here—no signs of privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or attempts to modify system configurations. The same file creation event happening multiple times might be part of an installation or update process for a software package.\n\nHowever, the number of events (16 in total) is quite high. While this could indicate normal operation, especially if SDXHelper.exe is handling many resources, it's worth noting. But without more context on what's typical for this process, I can't say for sure. Still, since each file path seems structured and not random or obfuscated, the likelihood of these being malicious is low.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether multiple identical events could be a sign of something else, like an attempt to write files repeatedly in case some fail. But again, without more data on how this process behaves under normal circumstances, it's hard to assess that as suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while the high number of file creations might warrant closer monitoring, there's no clear indication of malicious activity based solely on these events. Therefore, I classify this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence level of 0.8.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by the same process in a common directory structure, likely part of legitimate application behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to analyze them as a whole to determine if the batch is relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event. Each line has three main components: process, winlog, and file. The process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\". The winlog task is consistently \"File created\" under the same rule, which suggests it's a standard file creation event. The file path varies slightly in the last part after \"excel-copilot-strings_\", but all of them are within the same directory structure.\n\nI notice that each event creates a new file with different filenames. However, all these files are located inside the Office SolutionPackages directory under \"OfflineFiles\". This makes me think that this is related to Microsoft Office's offline functionality or perhaps Copilot features, which might be legitimate activities. \n\nNow, considering \"SDXHelper.exe\", I recall that this could be a helper process for Office applications, possibly dealing with updates or package management. The repeated file creation events could be part of normal operations, such as downloading and storing resources needed for the application to run, especially if it's handling offline content.\n\nI also consider whether multiple identical file creation events are suspicious. If an application is legitimately creating several files in quick succession, this might not be malicious. It seems like each file has a unique name, so maybe they're temporary or cache files being downloaded.\n\nLooking at the structure of the paths, everything appears to be within standard user directories and expected locations for Office-related data. There's no indication that these files are being created in system critical areas or outside the user profile, which could have raised more red flags.\n\nAnother point is that all events are from the same process and relate to file creation without any other actions like deletion or modification of sensitive files. This lack of variance in event types makes me lean towards normal operations rather than malicious activity.\n\nI also think about whether \"SDXHelper.exe\" has a known reputation. A quick mental note tells me that this is associated with legitimate Office processes, so it's unlikely to be malware acting under this name unless it's been compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\nConsidering the frequency of events, having multiple file creations in a short period might seem odd, but if each corresponds to different files and they're all within an expected structure, it might just be part of a bulk download or update process. \n\nIn summary, while any unexpected activity should be monitored, this batch doesn't exhibit signs that would raise immediate concerns for being malicious or indicative of a security issue. The consistent process name, predictable file paths, and nature of the events point towards legitimate operations rather than something suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which appears to be part of normal Microsoft Office operation.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events that were provided. Each line is a separate event, and I need to analyze all of them together to decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining each event one by one to understand what's happening. The first event shows \"winlogbeat.exe\" creating a file in the data directory with a .yml.new extension. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration files.\n\nThen, most of the events after that are from \"SDXHelper.exe\". Each event indicates that a file was created under a specific path related to Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. The paths all point to various JavaScript files with names like excel-copilot-strings followed by different hashes or identifiers. These seem repetitive but I'm not sure if that's normal behavior.\n\nI'm thinking about what SDXHelper.exe does. From my knowledge, it's often associated with Microsoft Office add-ins or custom solutions. The fact that it's creating multiple files in the OfflineFiles directory suggests it might be part of an Office package being installed or updated. Since these are just JavaScript strings files, maybe they're related to language packs or features for Excel Copilot.\n\nNow, considering whether this is unusual: SDXHelper.exe performing file creation tasks in those directories doesn't immediately raise red flags. It's possible that the system is installing or updating an Office add-in, which would require creating these files. The repetition of creating multiple JS files might indicate a standard installation process where several string resources are being placed.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here, like file deletions, unusual paths, or writes to restricted areas. All the files are in user directories, and the naming conventions seem consistent with legitimate software components.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, these events appear to be part of normal Office setup processes rather than anything suspicious.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, all events involve \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in a specific path related to Microsoft Office OfflineFiles. The file paths seem consistent, varying only slightly in their filenames. This looks like normal operation for an application that might be caching or storing resources locally.\n\nThen, there's an event with \"cleanmgr.exe\" being executed. Cleanmgr is part of Windows System Cleanup, so this seems routine too. It's not unusual for system processes to start and create files.\n\nI notice multiple entries from the same process creating similar files. This repetition makes me think it's part of a legitimate process, maybe during an Office update or when installing new features. The filenames look like they're JavaScript resources, which are typical in web-based applications within Office.\n\nSince all these events fit within expected behavior—no signs of irregular processes, unexpected file accesses, or anomalies—the batch doesn't raise any red flags.

Each event is a file creation task in Windows logs, specifically under the rule FileCreate. The files being created all have paths that include \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by different hashes or identifiers.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. Let's break down each part. \n\nThe process name is SDXHelper.exe. That sounds familiar—it’s often associated with Microsoft Office, specifically used for handling tasks like updating solutions and managing add-ins. So it's a legitimate process running on the system.\n\nEach event is about creating files in the OfflineFiles directory within the SolutionPackages folder under the user's AppData Local path. These are standard locations where applications store temporary or offline data, especially for Office which might need to cache files for use when online access isn't available.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all have unique identifiers after \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\". These look like hashed values, possibly indicating different language packs or versions of some component. The repeated occurrence of creating these files suggests that this is part of a normal update or installation process for Office add-ins or features.\n\nI should consider if such activity is typical. Since Office often requires downloading and caching resources when they are added or updated, multiple file creation events would be expected during setup or updates. There's no indication here of anything unusual like files being created in unexpected locations or access to sensitive areas outside the AppData folder.\n\nAnother point is that all these events are from the same process and same rule—no other types of log entries accompany them, so there's no context suggesting malicious activity such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nI also think about whether the number of events could be suspicious. There are 14 entries here, each creating a different file with varying hashes. While it seems like many files, they're all under a structured directory that's standard for Office's operations. If there were an anomaly, perhaps only one or two such files would appear, but this consistent pattern over multiple files aligns with legitimate behavior.\n\nLastly, considering the classification options—INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING—I lean towards NOT INTERESTING because these events don't exhibit signs of malicious activity. They fit within normal Office operations and don't indicate any compromise or security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of multiple file creation events by the legitimate SDXHelper.exe process, which is part of Microsoft Office's expected behavior for managing solution packages.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events, and each one is a JSON object representing an event. The process name in all these events is \"SDXHelper.exe\". The task from the Windows log is \"File created\", which follows the rule \"FileCreate\". Each event also specifies a file path where a new file was created.\n\nThe file paths are all under the same directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. The filenames vary but follow a pattern like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_[some_hash].js\". It looks like these are JavaScript files with different hashes appended to their names.\n\nSo, what's happening here? It seems that the SDXHelper.exe process is creating multiple JavaScript files in an Office-related directory. Each file creation event is logged, and they all come from the same executable and location. \n\nNow, considering this as a cybersecurity expert: SDXHelper.exe might be a legitimate process related to Microsoft Office or some solution package. The act of creating several JS files could be part of normal operations, like loading resources for an add-in or feature. However, the number of file creations here is significant—there are multiple entries with different hashes, which suggests that this process is generating many small files quickly.\n\nI should consider whether such behavior is usual. Legitimate software might update or cache resources, but creating so many similar files in a short time could be suspicious. Alternatively, it could also be part of a script or tool's normal operation, especially if these JS files are part of an application's package.\n\nAnother angle: the file paths contain GUID-like strings (82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b), which is common in software installations to uniquely identify components. The \"OfflineFiles\" folder suggests these might be cached files for offline use, which makes sense if it's part of an Office setup.\n\nHowever, the repetition and the fact that each file is created by the same process could raise flags. If this activity is unexpected or outside normal user behavior, it might indicate something malicious, like a script dropping multiple files as part of a payload.\n\nI also note that all events are from the same source (SDXHelper.exe) with identical actions except for the filenames. This homogeneity suggests either a legitimate bulk operation or potential automated malicious activity.\n\nTo determine if this is interesting, I need to assess whether such file creation patterns are normal. If SDXHelper.exe is known to create multiple JS files in that location during its operation, then it's probably not concerning. But if this behavior deviates from expected norms for that process, especially with the volume and frequency observed here, it might warrant closer investigation.\n\nGiven that I'm seeing 14 events of file creation by SDXHelper.exe within the same directory structure, each with a unique JS file, my confidence level is moderate.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, each representing an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The user is asking me to analyze the entire batch as a whole and determine if it's relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these events are about. Each line shows that the same executable, SDXHelper.exe, is creating a new file in a specific path. Looking at the file paths, they all start with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office...\", which points to a user-specific directory for Office applications. The files being created are JavaScript files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" and various suffixes.\n\nI know that SDXHelper.exe is related to Microsoft's Office Suite, possibly part of the Office Add-ins or Solution Packages. These packages often contain additional features or language packs that users install alongside Office. The fact that multiple JS files are being created suggests that this process is installing or updating some components for Office add-ins.\n\nNow, why would these events be interesting? I should consider whether such activity is normal or unusual. Typically, when an application updates or installs new features, it creates several files in the specified directories. This seems like standard behavior for an Office component to update its resources.\n\nHowever, I also need to think about possible malicious activities that might involve creating multiple files quickly. For example, some malware may drop multiple files to a directory as part of their payload delivery or persistence mechanism. But in this case, since the process is named after a legitimate Microsoft tool and it's creating JS files within an expected location, there doesn't seem to be any red flags.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these file creations are happening at an unusual frequency or time outside of normal user activity. If, for instance, these events occurred during non-business hours without any recent updates being installed, that might raise suspicion. But since I don't have additional context about the timing, I can only go by what's presented.\n\nAlso, looking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\", which sounds like it could be related to AI features in Office, such as Copilot in Excel or other AI-driven tools. These are legitimate parts of Microsoft's offerings and wouldn't be considered malicious on their own.\n\nI should also check if there are any variations between the events that might indicate something amiss. All events have the same process name and task, with only the file paths differing slightly due to different suffixes. This uniformity suggests a controlled process rather than random or haphazard file creation typical of malicious activities.\n\nAnother consideration is whether SDXHelper.exe is known for any suspicious behavior. From what I recall, it's part of the Office suite's update mechanism and isn't associated with malware. Therefore, seeing this process create multiple files in its expected directory doesn't raise concerns.\n\nIn summary, while each event on its own might seem a bit repetitive, collectively they don't indicate anything beyond normal system activity related to an Office add-in update or installation. There's no evidence of unusual file paths, unexpected processes, or irregular timestamps that would suggest malicious intent.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I feel confident in classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because it aligns with expected behavior from a legitimate Microsoft process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creation events by SDXHelper.exe appear to be related to normal Office package updates or installations.

Also, the process name is SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but I can try to recall or check what SDXHelper.exe does.\n\nUpon thinking, SDXHelper.exe might be related to Microsoft Office, perhaps an update or helper tool. The path under AppData and Microsoft\\Office suggests it's part of the Office suite. The SolutionPackages directory is common in Office for storing add-ins or components.\n\nLooking at how many events there are: I count 14 entries. Each one is a file creation event by the same process, but each file is different. So this seems like a legitimate activity from an application component.\n\nNow, considering whether this batch is interesting for investigation. Typically, multiple file creations by the same process could be normal if it's part of the software's operation, especially during updates or installations. However, if these files were created in large numbers suddenly or outside usual patterns, that might raise a flag.\n\nBut here, each event seems to be creating a different JavaScript file under an expected location. The repetition suggests maybe multiple resources being loaded or cached. Since they're all .js files and the process is tied to Office, it's plausible this is part of normal operations, perhaps for add-ins or language packs.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here: no unexpected paths, no access to restricted areas, and all actions are file creations without any indicators like deletions, modifications, or network traffic that might be suspicious.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't seem to indicate anything unusual.

For example, I see two entries for each of the following files:\n- officeaicopilot-strings.min_6bce757cc270c1ada438b863338d0d2f.js\n- officeaicopilot-strings.min_6c878e617b5cdf6ec02250c4701fa7ea.js\n- And so on for several others.\n\nThis repetition might indicate that the application is caching multiple versions or different resources. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate process of an Office-related tool or plugin downloading necessary files during runtime.\n\nI don't see any signs of unusual behavior here. The process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" doesn't ring any immediate bells as malicious. If this were suspicious activity, I might expect varying file paths, attempts to access restricted areas, or indicators like multiple failed operations which aren't present here.\n\nThe consistent and repetitive nature of the events suggests it's part of a normal application behavior, possibly related to Microsoft Office add-ins or similar legitimate processes. There's no evidence of exfiltration, unauthorized access, or other signs of compromise in these logs.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe under a standard user directory, likely part of normal Office operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events. All the entries are similar, so I'll start by examining one to understand the pattern.\n\nEach event shows that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific paths under the Office Solution Packages directory. The file names vary but follow a consistent naming convention with hashes and .js extensions. Since all these events are from the same process and involve file creation, my initial thought is whether this is normal behavior for the application.\n\nI know that \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be related to software like Microsoft Office or its updates. The path structure under AppData suggests it's part of the Office installation handling offline files or language packages. The multiple .js files being created could be JavaScript resources used by the application, possibly during an update or configuration process.\n\nLooking at the timestamps (though not provided), if these events occurred over a short period with many entries, it might indicate something unusual like bulk file creation, which could be suspicious. However, without more context, such as whether this is expected behavior post-update or part of normal operations, it's hard to tell.\n\nI should consider if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is known for legitimate activities that involve creating numerous files quickly. If so, then these events might not be malicious but rather part of the update process. On the other hand, if there's no clear reason why this process would create so many files, especially identical ones with different hashes, it could raise flags.\n\nAnother angle is to check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is commonly associated with malware. If it's a known benign process, then these file creations are likely normal. Conversely, if it's flagged as malicious, the events become more concerning.\n\nIn summary, while the repeated creation of files by \"SDXHelper.exe\" could be suspicious, without additional context or indicators of compromise (like unusual file hashes or execution outside expected times), I'm leaning towards this being part of legitimate operations. Therefore, it might not warrant immediate investigation but should still be monitored for any deviations from established patterns.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of the same process creating files in a known Microsoft Office directory appear to be part of normal operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of events. First off, I notice that each event is a JSON object representing some system activity. The process name in every case is \"SDXHelper.exe\", and the task is consistently a \"File created\" event with a specific rule mentioned.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they all point to different .js files under the same parent directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\. Each file has a unique name with varying suffixes, like _b073bf860080b51dd95889317aadf7d4.js and others.\n\nMy initial thought is that these are log entries from the same process creating multiple files. The repetition of the same process name suggests it's a legitimate activity, possibly part of an Office add-in or solution package. These packages often cache JavaScript files for offline use, which would explain why there are multiple files being created.\n\nI should consider whether this behavior is normal. Since all events come from the same source and follow a consistent pattern, it doesn't raise immediate red flags. However, the number of entries (14 in total) could indicate either a bulk operation or something more nefarious, but given the context, it's likely part of the application's setup.\n\nThere's no indication of unauthorized access, changes to sensitive files, or other signs of malicious activity. The file paths are within standard user directories and related to Microsoft Office packages, which further supports that this is expected behavior.\n\nTo be thorough, I could check if \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a known legitimate process. A quick search tells me it's associated with Microsoft Office, specifically handling solution package resources. This aligns with the file paths observed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the volume of events might seem high, there's no evidence to suggest malicious intent. It appears to be a normal part of the software's operation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch consists of repeated file creation events by SDXHelper.exe, which is likely related to legitimate Office package resource initialization.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me look at the logs provided.\n\nEach JSON object represents an event where a file was created by the process \"SDXHelper.exe\". The files are located in various paths under the user's AppData directory within Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages and OfflineFiles. The filenames all seem to be JavaScript files related to Office AI Copilot or Word Copilot, with different hashes appended.\n\nI notice that each event is almost identical except for the file path. For example, some have \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by different hash strings, while others are \"word-copilot.min\" with their own hashes. Also, there are multiple entries creating the same files repeatedly—some appear twice or more.\n\nNow, considering what's normal: SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to Microsoft Office, handling updates and package resources. Creating files in these locations during normal operation is expected when downloading or updating features like Copilot.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the events makes me think this could be part of a routine update or cache refresh. The same files being created multiple times might just be due to retries or parallel processing during an update.\n\nHowever, since all events are from the same process and involve file creation in expected locations for legitimate Office operations, there's no indication of malicious activity here. No signs of privilege escalation, unusual access patterns, or attempts to write to restricted areas.\n\nTherefore, while it's always good to monitor such activities, this batch doesn't show any red flags that would require immediate investigation. The events are likely part of normal Office operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events represent routine file creation activities by a legitimate Microsoft Office process, SDXHelper.exe, related to package resources and updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've got this batch of log events to analyze. Let's see what we're dealing with here.\n\nFirst off, each event is a JSON object representing something that happened on the system. The structure seems consistent across all lines: there's a process name, a Windows log task description, and a file path where a file was created.\n\nThe process name is always \"SDXHelper.exe\". I recognize this as a legitimate Microsoft Office application, specifically related to Solution Packages. These are used for deploying custom solutions in Office, so it's not something malicious by default.\n\nLooking at the events, each one says that a file was created (task: FileCreate). The files are located in specific paths under \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\". These paths have GUID-like identifiers which are typical for package installations. Inside these packages, there are offline files with names like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" and \"word-copilot.min\", followed by various hash-like strings in their filenames.\n\nI notice that each file path under the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles directory is creating a new file. The same files are being created multiple times (like the paths ending with different hashes). This duplication might indicate that the system is updating or caching these files repeatedly, which could be normal if the application is refreshing its resources periodically.\n\nI'm thinking about why this would be interesting. Since all events involve legitimate processes and standard file operations within expected locations, there's no immediate red flag. The process name is known to be part of Microsoft Office, and creating files in those paths aligns with how such packages operate.\n\nHowever, the number of events could be a point of consideration. If this is happening excessively, it might impact system performance or indicate an issue, but from the logs provided, there's no evidence of that. Each event just reports on a file creation without any signs of errors or unauthorized access.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether these files are being created by malicious software mimicking SDXHelper.exe. But given that the process name is correct and the paths point to expected locations within Office packages, it seems less likely unless there's a specific known exploit related to this exact setup, which I'm not aware of.\n\nI also check if the file names could be suspicious. The \"copilot\" part might refer to AI features in Office, but since they're part of the package resources, they shouldn't pose a threat on their own. Unless these files are being executed outside their intended purpose, but there's no indication of that from the logs.\n\nIn summary, all events point to normal operations of the Microsoft Office system creating necessary files for functionality. There's consistency in the process names and file paths, nothing unusual or unexpected in terms of permissions or locations accessed.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to legitimate file creation activities by a known Microsoft Office process (SDXHelper.exe) within standard system directories.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've been given a batch of JSONL events to analyze as a cybersecurity expert. The task is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. Let me go through each step methodically.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of each event. Each line represents a separate JSON object with three main keys: process, winlog, and file. \n\nThe 'process' key always has \"name\":\"SDXHelper.exe\". That's consistent across all events. SDXHelper is likely an internal tool or part of Microsoft Office, perhaps related to the Copilot feature given the filenames.\n\nThe 'winlog' key indicates that a file was created, with the task description being \"File created\" and a specific rule mentioned each time. So these are log entries from Windows indicating the creation of files by the SDXHelper.exe process.\n\nLooking at the 'file' paths, they all point to locations within the user's AppData directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames have patterns like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" and \"word-copilot.min_...\". These seem to be JavaScript files, likely related to the AI Copilot feature in Word or a similar tool.\n\nNow, considering the volume: there are 16 events here. Each event is the creation of a specific JS file by SDXHelper.exe. The same filenames appear twice each except for two entries which have unique filenames but still follow the pattern. This repetition suggests that these might be normal operations rather than malicious activity.\n\nFrom a cybersecurity perspective, what's concerning? Unusual files created in unexpected locations could indicate malware or exfiltration attempts. But here, all files are being created in expected locations associated with Microsoft Office and its features. SDXHelper.exe is a known process related to the Office software, especially with updates or package installations.\n\nI also notice that all these events are under the same user's AppData directory. If it were a breach, we might see more varied file types or paths outside of standard application directories.\n\nAnother point is the naming convention of the files. They all follow a predictable pattern with hash-like filenames (e.g., c62d76d06f0f547a17fe8ca50b485ab5.js). While such hashes can sometimes be obfuscation techniques, in this context, it's more likely part of how Office manages its resources or cache.\n\nI should also consider if the creation of multiple files in quick succession is normal. In a legitimate scenario, during an update or feature installation, several resource files might be created as part of the process. This seems consistent with that behavior.\n\nIs there any red flag? The repetition and identical nature of each event don't raise immediate concerns. If there were anomalies like access to sensitive files, attempts to write to system directories, or unexpected network communications, that would be more concerning. But here, everything is contained within the user's local AppData and relates directly to Office features.\n\nMoreover, in enterprise environments, it's common for legitimate processes to create multiple files during updates or initial setup. Monitoring such events without additional context (like failed attempts, access from unauthorized sources) wouldn't typically be flagged as suspicious.\n\nIn summary, while each individual file creation is a log event worth noting, the entire batch doesn't exhibit signs of malicious activity when considered together. The consistent process name, known application association, and expected file locations support that these are normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show SDXHelper.exe creating files in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which is a legitimate operation related to Office updates or features.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system events. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. The first thing I notice is that all these events are from the same process: \"SDXHelper.exe\". That's interesting because it means whatever is happening is tied to this specific application.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, each event is about a file being created. So, \"File created\" with a specific rule mentioned. The files are located in the path \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\". That seems like a standard user-specific directory for Office applications.\n\nThe filenames have long GUID-like strings followed by .js extensions. For example, \"word-copilot.min_15ce82224af5ee4456bf17b6b20990c2.js\". This looks like they're versioned or uniquely identified files, possibly part of a package resource for Office add-ins or similar.\n\nI'm thinking about whether these events are normal. \"SDXHelper.exe\" might be an legitimate process related to Microsoft Office, perhaps handling updates or package resources. The repeated creation of these JS files could be part of the application's normal operation—maybe caching or updating JavaScript components used by Office features like Copilot.\n\nNow, considering if this is malicious: unusual file creations can indicate malicious activity, but in this case, all events are consistent with each other and point to legitimate operations. There's no indication of access from unknown sources, file permissions issues, or deviations from baseline behavior as per known patterns.\n\nI should also check for the number of events. There are 14 identical entries here. If a process is creating multiple files in quick succession, it could be a sign of something suspicious like a download or extraction of malicious files. However, given that these are all under Office's directory and named as package resources, it seems more likely they're part of an update or legitimate file operations.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, attackers might mimic normal processes for persistence or to avoid detection. But without additional indicators such as unusual timestamps, locations outside the expected paths, or other anomalies, it's hard to classify these events as malicious.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think these events are probably part of normal operations, specifically related to Office updates or feature package installations. The consistency and location suggest they're not indicative of malicious activity but rather standard file handling by a legitimate process.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show repeated file creation activities by SDXHelper.exe, which appears to be related to Microsoft Office package resources and is likely part of normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

The files are located in various paths under the \"AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\" directory.
