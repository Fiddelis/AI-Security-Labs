{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a generic event with \"task\":\"None\" and no other details. That doesn't tell me much on its own. Then, the next few logs show \"winlogbeat.exe\" being created and accessing files like .ndjson and .yml.new. Winlogbeat is typically used for log shipping, so this seems normal unless it's behaving abnormally.\n\nNext, I see that a PowerShell process is created, which executes from the system32 directory. That's not unusual since PowerShell is a common tool. However, there are several ImageLoad events showing DLLs being loaded by powershell.exe. This can be standard for script execution but might also indicate malicious activity if these DLLs are known to be harmful.\n\nThen, I notice a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_juwnl41u.5gi.ps1 being created and then deleted. The creation of such a script could be testing policy settings, which is normal during configuration. But the quick deletion might raise suspicion; sometimes attackers delete traces after execution. \n\nThere are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe, which can indicate script activity but don't necessarily mean anything bad. The pipe creation by PowerShell could be for communication between processes, a common tactic in both legitimate scripts and malware.\n\nOverall, while there's some activity around PowerShell and file deletions that could warrant closer look, nothing here stands out as clearly malicious or indicative of an ongoing attack. It could just be normal system operations with logging tools like winlogbeat running and scripts being tested.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows normal system activity including process creation, file operations, and image loading typical of legitimate processes like winlogbeat.exe and PowerShell. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_185900.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. I'm new to this, but I'll go through each log step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of events related to \"winlogbeat.exe\". It looks like it's being executed from the Downloads folder. The first event has no task specified, then there's a process create rule for winlogbeat. Next, it accesses powershell.exe, which is something that can be malicious but might also be normal.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events from winlogbeat and powershell. Those seem standard if these processes are running legitimate operations. There's a File Create event for some .ndjson file, a lock file, and a .yml.new file. These could be related to the program's configuration or logs.\n\nMoving on, there are two Registry value set events from mmc.exe and Explorer.EXE. Those don't immediately raise red flags, but I know that writing to the registry can sometimes be part of malicious activities. Then, powershell.exe is created again with a command line path. That's interesting because powershell is often used for scripting, which could be either legitimate admin tasks or something more nefarious.\n\nThere's a File Create and then a File Delete logged event for a temporary PS script file. The filename has a random string, which is common in automated scripts. I'm thinking maybe it's testing some policy or executing a script that gets deleted afterward. However, the deletion being logged makes me wonder if something went wrong or if there was an attempt to remove evidence.\n\nThen there are multiple Provider Lifecycle events from powershell.exe. I'm not exactly sure what those mean, but they seem like normal PowerShell activities, maybe starting or stopping services. There's a Pipe Created event too, which is typical for inter-process communication in scripts.\n\nLooking further, more Image Load and Engine Lifecycle events happen with various DLLs like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. These might be related to Windows Defender or other system processes, so they don't seem suspicious on their own.\n\nFinally, there's another Process Create event for ipconfig.exe with the \"\/all\" flag. That's a common command used by admins to check network settings, but it could also be part of an attack chain to gather information about the system.\n\nPutting it all together: The logs show winlogbeat running, which I think is an ELK stack tool for log management, maybe being run by someone on the network. Then, there's a lot of powershell activity, including creating and deleting temporary scripts. While using powershell isn't bad itself, the creation and deletion of that script file might indicate something malicious like executing commands without logging them properly or trying to avoid detection.\n\nThe multiple Provider Lifecycle events could be normal, but combined with the temporary script and deletions, it raises some questions. Maybe someone is testing permissions or running scripts in a way that's intended to be stealthy.\n\nI'm not sure about the significance of all these together. I think there might be cause for concern because of the powershell activity and the handling of the temp file. It could indicate scripting behavior that's either legitimate admin work or part of malicious activities. To be safe, further investigation would be needed to see if these actions are authorized or match known patterns of attacks.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs exhibits a combination of normal system processes and activities that may warrant attention due to the presence of potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). Here's a concise analysis:\n\n1. **Winlogbeat Activity**: The logs show multiple instances of `winlogbeat.exe` running from a Downloads folder, creating log files, and accessing PowerShell. While `winlogbeat` is typically used for log management, its execution from a user-download directory could indicate unauthorized access or potential tampering.\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage**: There are numerous events involving PowerShell, including script creation, deletion, and process lifecycle changes. The creation of a temporary script file followed by its deletion might suggest an attempt to execute commands without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\n3. **Registry and File Operations**: Registry modifications and the handling of temporary files could be part of legitimate administration tasks or indicative of malicious activity aiming to alter system configurations or hide traces.\n\n4. **Network Command Execution**: The use of `ipconfig.exe \/all` might indicate information gathering, which is often a step in attack chains where adversaries gather network details.\n\n**Conclusion**: While some activities are typical, the combination of PowerShell script handling and unusual file operations suggests potential malicious behavior. Further investigation is recommended to assess whether these actions align with authorized operations or pose a security risk."}
