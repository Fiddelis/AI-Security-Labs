{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most are from PowerShell. There's a lot of ImageLoad tasks, which means modules or DLLs are being loaded into memory. That in itself isn't bad because PowerShell often does that when running scripts. But I should check if these loads are normal or if some are unusual.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate and then a FileDeleteDetected event for the same file: __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1. That seems suspicious. Why create a script file only to delete it right after? Maybe an attempt to test permissions or write malicious code that gets removed upon detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are PipeCreated events. PowerShell often uses pipes for communication, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for lateral movement or command and control. I need to see if the creation of these pipes is part of a larger pattern, like multiple instances or from different processes.\n\nThe other events include tasks like Registry value sets and Provider Lifecycle events, which could be normal script activity. But combined with the file deletion and pipe creation, it raises flags. It's possible that someone is testing system behavior or trying to execute something malicious but quickly cleaning up traces.\n\nI'm also noting the number of times PowerShell starts (ProcessCreate) and the multiple ImageLoad events. While not all are suspicious on their own, the combination suggests there might be something more going on. The fact that some logs come from different command lines but still involve powershell.exe could indicate process injection or multiple script executions.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple file operations, module loading, and pipe creation in a short time frame with an attempt to create and delete a script file. These are red flags for potential malicious activity like testing exploit code or establishing persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple PowerShell events including file creation, deletion, registry modifications, and image loads, which may indicate suspicious activity such as script execution testing or cleanup.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is creating files and accessing registry values. This stands out because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The creation of a new .ps1 file (teste.ps1) might be suspicious if it's unexpected or unsanctioned in the environment.\n\nLooking further, there are events showing that powershell.exe is being executed with an ExecutionPolicy set to Bypass. This is a red flag because Bypass allows scripts to run without prompting, which can be a tactic used by attackers to execute malicious scripts.\n\nAdditionally, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe, followed by several image load events as it loads various DLLs. While this isn't inherently suspicious on its own, combined with the other actions, it raises questions about what the script is doing.\n\nAnother point of concern is the creation and deletion of a temporary file (__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1). This could indicate that the script is testing something or attempting to avoid detection by cleaning up after itself. The fact that this file is created and then deleted quickly might suggest malicious activity, like a persistence mechanism.\n\nThere's also an event with \"Execute a Remote Command\" which is null in all fields except process. This could mean that PowerShell is being used to execute commands on a remote system, which is often a sign of command-and-control activities or lateral movement within a network.\n\nConsidering the entire batch together, these events show a series of actions that are commonly associated with malicious behavior: creating and executing scripts, bypassing execution policies, loading images, and attempting remote command execution. While some of these could be part of normal administrative tasks, the combination, especially the use of Bypass ExecutionPolicy and the file creation\/deletion pattern, strongly suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nI'm confident enough to classify this batch as interesting because it aligns with known attack patterns, even if individual events might not seem suspicious on their own. The cumulative effect raises concerns about a possible security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show file creation, registry modifications, and remote command execution, indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
