{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice there are multiple entries from different processes like winlogbeat.exe and mmc.exe, but the majority seem to be related to powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities. The fact that there are so many events from it might indicate something significant.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks: there's a \"Process Create\" event when powershell.exe starts, which is normal. But then I see several \"Registry value set\" tasks from Explorer.EXE and Powershell. Registry changes can be benign but also part of malicious activities like persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation.\n\nThere are multiple \"Image loaded\" events for various DLLs. While this is typical during process initialization, the specific files being loaded, like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll, might be worth checking if they're associated with known malware or if there's unusual behavior in their loading sequence.\n\nA couple of entries mention file creation and deletion in temporary directories. For example, a file __PSScriptPolicyTest_pby4rzcb.dfy.ps1 is created and then deleted. Temporary files can be part of script execution, but the fact that it was created and immediately deleted might raise suspicions about an attempt to avoid detection or execute malicious scripts without leaving traces.\n\nAnother point is the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events from powershell.exe. While these are part of normal PowerShell operation, frequent provider registrations could indicate an unusual level of activity, possibly scripting or automation beyond standard usage.\n\nAlso, there's a file named teste.ps1 being created in the Downloads folder and executed with the command line showing \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\". This is concerning because bypassing execution policies can allow running scripts that are otherwise blocked, often used by attackers to execute malicious code.\n\nIn summary, while some events are routine, others like registry modifications, temporary file operations, and script execution with policy bypass are red flags. The volume of PowerShell activities might indicate a concerted effort that could be suspicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but these patterns are definitely worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events related to PowerShell activity, including registry modifications and execution of scripts with bypassed policies, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_190800.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events from a JSONL file. Let me start by looking at each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first event shows that powershell.exe is being accessed. That's not too unusual since PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But just accessing it doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe loads images. Specifically, they're loading DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are all part of the .NET framework, which PowerShell relies on for its functionality. So this seems normal unless these modules are being loaded in an unexpected way.\n\nThen, there's a file creation event for a temporary script \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_wkvsotss.si5.ps1\". This is interesting because creating temporary scripts can be part of testing or legitimate script execution, but it could also be used by attackers to execute malicious code. The fact that this script was later deleted might indicate something suspicious, like an attempt to bypass logging or remove evidence.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. This location is typically related to PowerShell profile scripts, which can automate tasks when the shell starts. If an attacker creates a profile script, they could gain persistence across sessions, making this a potential red flag.\n\nThere's also an event where a registry value was set using powershell.exe. Registry modifications are common in malware for persistence or configuration changes. Without knowing what exactly was changed, it's hard to say, but any unexpected registry activity under PowerShell's context should be looked into.\n\nLastly, there's an event indicating the execution of a remote command. This is definitely concerning because executing commands remotely can be used to carry out attacks like remote code execution. If this wasn't authorized or doesn't fit normal usage patterns, it's a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple file creations and deletions, especially temporary scripts; registry modifications; and a remote command executionâ€”these are all signs that could point towards malicious behavior. While individual events might not be alarming, the combination suggests that something fishy is going on.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows powershell.exe accessing multiple files and executing a remote command, which are red flags for potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
