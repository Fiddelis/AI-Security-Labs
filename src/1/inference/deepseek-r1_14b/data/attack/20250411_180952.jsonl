{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I have a batch of system log events to analyze as a whole to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. **svchost.exe** performing a DNS query and nothing else. That's normal since svchost is part of Windows services.\n2. **MpDefenderCoreService.exe** detected a network connection. That makes sense because it's related to antivirus\/antimalware, so monitoring network activity is expected.\n3. **chrome.exe** with both DNS queries and network connections. Browsers do this regularly for navigation and resource loading, so nothing unusual here.\n\nThen I notice multiple instances of **powershell.exe** accessing processes and registry events. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious scripts because it has built-in administrative functions. The fact that there are several process accesses and a registry value set could be red flags. Additionally, the command line details aren't provided, which makes it harder to assess if they're legitimate admin tasks or malicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there are **cmd.exe** processes with specific commands adding users and groups to the domain. The commands use usernames like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and passwords such as \"registro_temporario_pass123!\". These seem suspicious because they follow a pattern that could indicate credential dumping or privilege escalation. Creating new domain users and adding them to the Domain Admins group without legitimate admin credentials is concerning.\n\nThere are also instances of **net.exe** and **net1.exe** executing similar commands, which is unusual because net1.exe isn't a standard Windows command. This might be an attempt to bypass detection or use alternative tools for creating accounts, which could be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe events involving **winlogbeat.exe**, **powershell.exe**, and **svchost.exe** creating files seem normal if they're related to log shipping or script execution. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nConsidering all these points together: multiple network connections from different processes, elevated privileges via domain admin additions, unusual command line arguments in powershell.exe and net1.exe, which aren't standard commands. These collectively suggest potential malicious activity such as credential theft, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.\n\nThe confidence level is high because the combination of events—especially the use of non-standard tools like net1.exe and multiple instances of process creation with suspicious command lines—points to a coordinated attack rather than normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of network connections, process creations, and registry modifications indicate potential malicious activities such as credential dumping or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to figure out if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows svchost.exe creating a file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUtmp.log. Svchost is a common system process, but sometimes malware uses it. The fact that it's writing to the SRU directory might be normal, but I should keep an eye on where files are being created.\n\nNext up is winlogbeat.exe creating a file in C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads... That seems off because winlogbeat is typically for log shipping and shouldn't create files in user directories. This could indicate tampering or misuse of the tool, which might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are two events from powershell.exe: one setting a registry value and another accessing a process. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by attackers. The fact that it's modifying the registry without clear justification raises red flags. Maybe it's trying to persistence or alter system configurations maliciously.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm concerned about the combination of these events. Svchost creating files in known directories isn't too alarming on its own, but when combined with powershell activities and winlogbeat behavior, it suggests potential malicious activity. The high number of red flags across different processes makes me confident that this batch is definitely interesting for a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple potentially suspicious events including svchost.exe file creation in system directory, winlogbeat.exe creating files in user directory, and powershell.exe registry modification.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
