{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from svchost.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. Svchost is a common Windows process, often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. However, without more context, these could just be normal activities like system updates or background processes.\n\nNext, I see multiple chrome.exe instances making network connections and DNS queries. Browsers do this regularly for navigation and resource fetching, so these might not indicate anything suspicious on their own.\n\nThen there's a process access event from powershell.exe. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers, but it can also be part of legitimate admin tasks. I need to look at the command lines if they exist, but in this case, the command line isn't provided for these events.\n\nLooking further down, there are several cmd.exe processes with specific command lines. The commands use 'net user' and 'net group' to add users and groups to the domain. This catches my attention because adding new users or groups, especially using domain-level commands, could be part of privilege escalation or creating backdoor accounts. The usernames like \"pacote_principal_Admin\" and passwords such as \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" seem suspiciousâ€”they don't follow typical naming conventions and might indicate an attempt to create administrative accounts without proper authorization.\n\nAnother cmd.exe entry shows the creation of a group in Domain Admins, which is a highly privileged group. This could be part of setting up access for attackers. The command lines are quite specific and seem out of place if not executed by legitimate admin scripts.\n\nThere's also an instance of conhost.exe modifying registry values. Conhost is another Windows process that can sometimes be involved in malicious activities, especially when combined with registry changes, which can alter system configurations or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events from winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe creating files in specific paths. While log shipping tools like winlogbeat are common, the presence of new files created by these processes could be worth monitoring if they don't align with expected behavior.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the repeated use of cmd.exe to create user accounts and add them to Domain Admins stands out as potentially malicious activity. This combination suggests unauthorized access or an attack where an adversary is setting up persistence or privilege escalation within the domain environment.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple cmd.exe processes adding users and groups to the domain, which may indicate unauthorized access attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
