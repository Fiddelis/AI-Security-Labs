{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few events, all are from 'chrome.exe' showing network connections and DNS queries. That seems normal because browsers do a lot of network activity, so probably nothing suspicious there.\n\nNext, I see 'RuntimeBroker.exe', 'notepad.exe', and 'powershell.exe' accessing registry values or processes. These are legitimate system processes doing their tasks, so no immediate red flags.\n\nLooking further down, there's an event from 'cmd.exe' with a command line that includes creating scheduled tasks using schtasks. The command lines specify tasks like \"calc.exe\" being executed on logon or startup. That seems concerning because creating persistent tasks to run calc.exe could be part of malicious activity, especially if it's trying to execute system commands.\n\nThen there are multiple events from 'schtasks.exe' creating scheduled tasks and loading image DLLs. This could indicate an attempt to set up persistence mechanisms in the system. The repeated use of schtasks with similar command lines might suggest a script or tool being used to create these tasks, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, several entries show 'svchost.exe' setting registry values and creating files in Task directories. Since svchost is often associated with legitimate services but can also be used by malware, the combination of multiple registry changes and file creation could indicate suspicious activity.\n\nCalculating all this together, the repeated use of schtasks to create startup tasks, especially using cmd.exe to run calc.exe, stands out as potentially malicious behavior. The involvement of powershell.exe accessing processes might be part of an attempt to execute commands or hide activities.\n\nGiven these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because it shows signs of possible persistence mechanisms and unusual process activity that could indicate a cyber threat.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potential malicious activities such as scheduled tasks created with calc.exe execution, repeated registry modifications, and unusual file creations, suggesting possible persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of entries where different processes are setting registry values. Specifically, svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe all have tasks marked as 'Registry value set'. That seems a bit unusual because legitimate software doesn't typically change the registry that often, especially across so many different processes.\n\nThen there's an entry from winlogbeat.exe where it created a file. That might be normal if winlogbeat is part of the system's logging setup, but I'm not entirely sure. It's creating a .yml.new file in its data directory, which could be part of its configuration process. Not too suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at chrome.exe, there are multiple instances where it loaded different DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those sound like legitimate Windows components used for things like anti-malware scanning interfaces (AMSI) and maybe system monitoring. So that doesn't stand out as malicious.\n\nPowershell.exe is appearing a few times with tasks like 'Process accessed' and creating files, including one named 'unidade_ativo.txt'. Powershell is commonly used by attackers because it's powerful and can do so much. The creation of this file might be suspicious, but without more context on what's in the file or how it was used, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing that caught my eye is whoami.exe being run from the command line. Whoami is typically a benign tool used to check user information. But when combined with other activities, especially from powershell.exe, it could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThe frequency of registry changes by various processes is concerning. Attackers often modify the registry to persistence their malware or change system configurations. The fact that so many different executables are doing this might be a sign of malicious activity trying to blend in under the radar.\n\nHowever, I'm not seeing any direct indicators of compromise (IoCs) like known malicious file paths or unusual network connections. Most activities seem to align with what's possible in a compromised environment but could also occur due to misconfigurations or legitimate software behaving oddly.\n\nOn balance, while there are red flags like multiple registry writes and powershell activity, the lack of clear IoCs makes me lean towards this being potentially suspicious but not definitively malicious. It might still warrant closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes (svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe) showing registry modification activities which could indicate potential malicious behavior or persistence mechanisms.
