{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this log analysis. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, each representing different system activities. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first few lines are all from chrome.exe with tasks like DNS queries and network connections. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of network activity for browsing. Nothing suspicious there yet.\n\nThen, RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. RuntimeBroker is related to Windows updates and managing background processes, so that's benign too.\n\nNext, notepad.exe setting a registry value—Notepad is a simple text editor; it shouldn't be making many registry changes unless the system is misconfigured or compromised. I'll keep this in mind but not flag it yet.\n\nPowershell.exe accessing a process—Powershell is powerful and often used by attackers, but it's also commonly used for legitimate admin tasks. So, alone, this might not be a red flag.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll—that seems odd because Calculator typically doesn't load DLLs related to URL handling. This could indicate some tampering or potential malicious activity, maybe a process injection.\n\nLooking further down, cmd.exe is being used with schtasks to create scheduled tasks that run calc.exe on startup or logon. That's concerning because creating persistent tasks via command line can be a tactic for maintaining access. Especially since the commands are wrapped in quotes and have escaped characters, which might suggest obfuscation.\n\nPowershell.exe again, accessing another process—could be related to the previous cmd activity. If Powershell is being used alongside these scheduled tasks, it's worth monitoring.\n\nAnother cmd.exe setting a registry value—this could be part of creating or modifying system configurations to maintain persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple schtasks.exe creations with similar commands pointing to calc.exe. This repetition makes me think of a script possibly running multiple times, trying to create multiple backdoors, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nLastly, svchost.exe making several registry changes and file creation—Svchost is legitimate but often used by malware to hide processes. The repeated registry writes could be part of malicious activity, like installing a service or modifying system settings for persistence.\n\nPutting it all together: the use of schtasks with calc.exe as the command suggests persistence mechanisms, cmd.exe being used for scripting, and powershell involved might indicate an attacker using these tools for lateral movement or execution. The repeated registry writes by svchost could be setting up a service or hook to run malicious code at startup.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's a pattern of system process manipulation, creation of persistent tasks, and use of command-line tools in ways that go beyond normal user behavior. This indicates potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events indicating potentially malicious activities such as scheduled tasks created with schtasks.exe to execute calc.exe, repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe, and command-line activities suggesting persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze. The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, they all have the same structure: process name 'svchost.exe' with a task indicating a registry value was set. That seems normal because svchost.exe is a common Windows process that hosts system services, often interacting with the registry. But then I notice there are multiple such events in a row—maybe that's unusual? Or maybe not, since(svchost can have legitimate reasons to modify the registry.\n\nNext, I see an event where 'svchost.exe' created a file at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup'. The filename seems suspicious with '_ativo' which might be Portuguese for 'active.' Tasks in that directory are scheduled tasks. Maybe this is part of legitimate system operations, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen there's an event from 'cmd.exe' setting a registry value. cmd is commonly used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nOther processes like 'conhost.exe', 'ApplicationFrameHost.exe', 'Calculator.exe', etc., are all standard Windows processes. Their involvement in registry or other events doesn't immediately raise flags on their own.\n\nI notice a lot of events from 'chrome.exe' setting registry values and loading images like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Chrome is a browser; it interacts with various system components, so some of these activities are normal. However, multiple registry writes could be concerning if they're unusual for the user's typical behavior.\n\nThere's an event from 'powershell.exe' creating a file named 'unidade_ativo.txt' in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is powerful and often used by attackers, but it can also be legitimate. The filename again has '_ativo', which might indicate some activity or persistence mechanism.\n\nThe last few events are from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a config file and 'chrome.exe' continuing its activities. Winlogbeat is likely an agent for log management; if it's present and writing to configuration files, that's probably normal unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (svchost.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe) modifying the registry repeatedly could be a sign of malicious activity. The creation of specific files with '_ativo' in their names might suggest they're part of some automated or malicious process. Additionally, the high number of registry events from different processes might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or change system configurations in a way that's not typical for normal operations.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the combination of multiple registry writes by various legitimate-sounding processes and the creation of files with potentially suspicious names. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain. But considering all these points together, there are enough red flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including svchost.exe and powershell.exe performing registry modifications and file creations with potentially suspicious naming conventions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not for investigation. Let me look through the data provided.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. There are multiple entries where the process is 'chrome.exe' with a task related to setting a registry value. This happens six times. Chrome accessing the registry isn't uncommon, especially if it's updating settings or extensions.\n\n2. Then there's an entry for 'powershell.exe' accessing something (Process accessed). PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this might raise some flags but on its own isn't conclusive.\n\n3. Another event shows 'whoami.exe' being executed with the command line pointing to the system32 directory. Whoami is typically used to get user information and is usually not malicious unless it's part of a larger attack chain.\n\nNow, considering all these together: multiple registry writes by Chrome might be suspicious if they're unusual for that instance, but it's possible they're legitimate updates. The use of PowerShell accessing something could indicate script execution or command-line activity. Using whoami could be an information-gathering step in a potential attack.\n\nHowever, without additional context like timestamps showing these events happening within a short period (which might suggest a coordinated attack) or signs of failed attempts or other malicious activities, it's hard to say definitively that this batch indicates malicious behavior. It might just be regular user activity with some potentially suspicious elements but not enough to be certain.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the classification being \"NOT INTERESTING\" because while there are some red flags, they don't combine in a way that clearly points to malicious activity without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include legitimate processes like Chrome and whoami.exe, and while PowerShell access could be suspicious, the lack of additional context makes it hard to conclude malicious intent.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
