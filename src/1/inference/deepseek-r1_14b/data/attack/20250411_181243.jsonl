{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries related to powershell.exe being accessed and created multiple times. Powershell is a powerful tool that can be used both for legitimate scripting and for malicious activities, so repeated accesses could be a red flag. The presence of 'ProcessCreate' events indicates new instances of powershell starting, which might be part of normal operations but in this case seems excessive.\n\nLooking at the command lines, one of the powershell.exe processes has a lengthy command that includes commands like net user, get-localuser, and others. These are system administration commands, but when chained together, they could be used to gather information about users and groups on the system. This is concerning because such detailed information gathering is often a precursor to more malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an attempt to create a file in the Temp directory with a PowerShell script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_uyy23mak.n3r.ps1, followed by its deletion shortly after. The creation and immediate deletion of such files can be indicative of script execution attempts. This might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts are allowed to run.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe, loading various .NET framework components. While this is normal for PowerShell scripts, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me cautious.\n\nAnother point is that some events have 'Provider Lifecycle' as their task, which might indicate module or provider initialization within PowerShell. If these providers are being loaded without a clear reason, it could be part of an attack vector.\n\nThe fact that multiple instances of powershell.exe are running and performing various system-related tasks without any obvious legitimate purpose raises the suspicion of potential malicious activity. The use of command-line arguments that query user information, group memberships, and interact with system commands like cmdkey.exe further supports this concern.\n\nIn summary, the repeated process creations, script execution attempts, file manipulations, and system queries all point towards possible unauthorized access or malicious behavior. Therefore, these events should be classified as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances with suspicious command lines performing user and group enumeration, file creation\/deletion in Temp directory, registry modifications, and system queries suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL events, each with process, winlog, and file information.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of PowerShell executions. The command lines include commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', etc. These are common administrative commands but can be signs of malicious activity when executed in certain contexts or sequences.\n\nThere are multiple events with similar command lines from powershell.exe, which might indicate repeated attempts to gather system information. That could be part of reconnaissance before an attack or actual exfiltration of data.\n\nI also see references to 'Users' group and commands like 'get-childitem C:\\Users'. Accessing user directories can allow access to sensitive files, so that's a red flag. The use of 'cmdkey.exe \/list' suggests they're looking at cached credentials, which is definitely something attackers do to escalate privileges.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, there are Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle events related to powershell.exe. These might indicate module loading or initial setup but combined with other actions could be suspicious. There's also a FileCreate event for a .winlogbeat.yml file, which seems benign unless it's part of log tampering.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Process Create' events for net.exe and net1.exe executing 'user' commands. Using command-line tools like net can be part of legitimate admin tasks but in bulk could signal unauthorized access or credential dumping.\n\nThe presence of multiple Security Group Management and User Account Management events without corresponding process info might indicate attempts to modify permissions or user accounts, which is concerning if not authorized.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows several indicators of potential malicious activity: repeated PowerShell commands with administrative functions, attempts to access user directories and credentials, and multiple system process creations. While each individual event might be legitimate, the combination suggests a possible investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell executions with commands that could indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation, such as gathering user information and accessing sensitive directories.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are multiple instances where processes like cmdkey.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, and others are being created or accessed. These could be normal administrative tasks, but I should keep an eye out for anything suspicious.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe is appearing quite a bit with different log tasks: ProcessCreate, FileCreate, RegistryEvent, etc. PowerShell can be used maliciously, so too many instances might be a red flag. There are file creations in user directories like Downloads and AppData, which could indicate file manipulation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe use of net.exe and net1.exe for localgroup commands suggests possible attempts to modify security groups, which is concerning if done without proper authorization. Additionally, the cmdkey.exe command line seems to be listing cached credentials, which is a common technique in attacks to harvest credentials.\n\nThere are also Registry value sets from various processes, including conhost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe, which might be part of legitimate operations but could also be used for persistence or malicious configuration changes.\n\nThe creation of winlogbeat.yml.new by winlogbeat.exe could be related to log management tools, but it's worth checking if this is expected behavior in the environment. Unusual file names like elemento_logico.txt might hint at data being exfiltrated or stored temporarily.\n\nProcesses like notepad.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll don't immediately seem suspicious, but combined with other events, they might be part of a larger chain of activities that warrant closer investigation.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple PowerShell instances, credential dumping attempts via cmdkey.exe, net.exe commands for group management, and file creations in user directories raises concerns about potential malicious activity. These activities don't align with normal user behavior and could indicate an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including PowerShell executions, net.exe for group management, cmdkey.exe credential dumping attempts, file creations in user directories, and registry modifications. These actions suggest potential malicious behavior requiring further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
