{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of logs and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. That seems normal since Chrome is a browser and does connect to the internet regularly. No red flags here; maybe just regular browsing activity.\n\nThen I see events related to powershell.exe. The first one shows a Registry value being set. Powershell can do legitimate admin tasks, but registry changes alone aren't suspicious unless they're part of malicious activities. Next, there's a Process Create event for PowerShell with a command line that includes various commands like net user and get-localgroupmember. This is concerning because those commands are often used to query or modify system accounts and groups, which can be part of privilege escalation.\n\nLooking at the command line details, it runs a script that tries to access system information, check local users, group members, run cmdkey for credentials, list files in C:\\Users, and more. This seems like it could be malicious because it's gathering a lot of sensitive information. Also, there are multiple Image Load events for various DLLs. Powershell scripts often load these, but the combination with other activities might indicate something suspicious.\n\nThere's also a File Create event for a .ps1 script in a temporary directory, followed by deleting that same file. Creating and immediately deleting a script could be an attempt to avoid detection or log tampering. Additionally, there are Provider Lifecycle events without any associated files, which might relate to the powershell process initializing or terminating.\n\nPutting it all together: The batch shows normal Chrome activity but also multiple signs of PowerShell being used for potentially malicious purposes. The commands executed by PowerShell could be part of a script meant to gather system information and possibly gain unauthorized access. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file is another red flag, suggesting an attempt to hide activities. While not conclusive on its own, the combination of these events increases the likelihood that something suspicious is happening.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell process creations and activities, including registry modifications and file operations, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I see a lot of events here, and they're all in JSONL format. Each line represents an event with process info, winlog details, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe with specific command lines. The command lines include things like 'net user', 'get-localuser', etc. These are legitimate commands that admins use for system management, but they can also be used by attackers to gather information about the system. So that's a red flag.\n\nLooking at the tasks in winlog, I see events like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, Image loaded, Process Create, and so on. Some of these could be normal operations, especially when it comes to processes loading images or creating pipes. But combined with the powershell commands, it might indicate something malicious.\n\nThere are also several instances where chrome.exe is modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome can make changes to the registry for its settings, repeated writes could be suspicious if they're part of a larger pattern of system manipulation.\n\nAnother point is the file paths. For example, one powershell command creates a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\pacote_ativo.txt'. Creating files in user directories can be normal, but without context, it's hard to say. The presence of this along with other commands might suggest data exfiltration or file creation as part of malicious activities.\n\nI also see events from winlogbeat.exe creating a config file and processes like net.exe and net1.exe being used with 'user' command-line arguments. These could be attempts to list users on the system, which is something an attacker would do during lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\nThe fact that these events are repeated multiple times makes me think there's a pattern here. It doesn't look like one-off legitimate actions but rather a series of steps possibly taken by an adversary trying to enumerate systems and perhaps drop files or establish persistence.\n\nConsidering all these together, the combination of powershell commands, net.exe usage, file creation, and repeated registry changes seems indicative of malicious behavior. So the batch as a whole is probably interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe with suspicious command lines, including user enumeration and potential persistence mechanisms, along with file creation and repeated registry modifications suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an updater.exe process running with some command-line arguments. It seems normal for software updaters to run and check for updates, so probably nothing malicious here. The task is Process Create, which is standard.\n\nNext, cmdkey.exe is being used with the \/list option. I know that cmdkey is related to credential management. Using it to list might be a way to gather credentials or session keys, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious. It could be legitimate admin activity.\n\nThen there are several events about Security Group Management and User Account Management. These tasks involve changes in user groups or accounts, which can indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts. Multiple entries here might mean someone is probing for group memberships or trying to add users.\n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell process with a complex command line. The script includes commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, and cmdkey.exe again. This could be part of an automated attack where the attacker is enumerating users and groups, possibly preparing for lateral movement or privilege escalation. The fact that it's using multiple tools (net.exe, net1.exe) makes me think this isn't just a simple script; maybe it's trying different methods to ensure success.\n\nThere are also events about creating files in specific locations, like the PowerShell StartupProfileData. Creating files here might be an attempt to persistence or modify environment variables. Additionally, there are registry changes made by conhost.exe and others, which could indicate attempts to alter system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repetition of tasks related to security groups suggests a prolonged activity, maybe scanning or enumeration. This pattern over multiple events raises the suspicion that an attacker is systematically checking permissions, users, and groups, possibly preparing for further attacks.\n\nTaking all these together: legitimate processes like updaters and standard tools like cmdkey are being used, but in combination with PowerShell scripts that perform user enumeration and system modifications, it seems suspicious. The frequency of security-related tasks without corresponding application usage could indicate unauthorized access or an attack in progress.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as INTERESTING because the activities, especially the PowerShell script's actions, show signs of potential malicious behavior. The confidence isn't too high (maybe 0.7) since some events might be benign admin tasks, but the overall pattern is concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of process creations and system management activities, including use of cmdkey.exe and PowerShell commands that may indicate credential enumeration or unauthorized access attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of log events and determine if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file. That seems normal because it's part of the logging process, probably updating its configuration file.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll from System32. URLMON is a legitimate Windows component, so that's not suspicious.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe creating a file called modulo_base.txt. Powershell is commonly used by attackers, but creating files can be part of normal admin tasks. However, the name \"modulo\" might suggest something malicious, like persistence or credential dumping.\n\nThe next event is MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe being run with certain parameters. The command line looks standard for updates, so that's probably okay.\n\nSVCHost.exe modifying the registry twice. SVCHost runs many services and it's common to see registry changes; not enough info yet.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate loading taskschd.dll again â€“ taskschd is related to task scheduling, which is normal.\n\nBackgroundTaskHost loading urlmon again. Another legitimate DLL.\n\nAnother winlogbeat event creating the same file again. Still part of logging.\n\nThen powershell.exe setting a registry value and accessing something else without files. This could be concerning since multiple actions from powershell might indicate script execution, possibly malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: Two instances where powershell creates or modifies files\/registry, which could be signs of suspicious activity. Also, the file name \"modulo_base.txt\" stands out as potentially malicious. The combination suggests possible malicious scripts running, maybe attempting persistence or data exfiltration. So overall, this batch is interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe creating files and modifying registry values, which may indicate potential malicious activity such as script execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
