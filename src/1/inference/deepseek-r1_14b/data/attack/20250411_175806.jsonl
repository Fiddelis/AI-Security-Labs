{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this batch of logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nLooking through the events, I notice a lot of process creations and accesses, especially from powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe, and conhost.exe. These are common tools but can be used maliciously. For example, powershell.exe is often seen in attacks because it has powerful scripting capabilities. The fact that it's accessing different files and registry keys might be a red flag.\n\nThere are multiple instances where these processes are modifying the Windows Registry, like using REG ADD commands to set values under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. That's suspicious because attackers often use such registry entries to persistence their malware so it runs at startup. The file paths mentioned, like \"modulo_padrao.txt\" and others, might be part of a payload or script being executed.\n\nAlso, the same user 'fiddelis' is involved in several events, which could indicate a single user's activity or potentially compromised account. The creation of files by winlogbeat.exe seems legitimate if it's an agent collecting logs, but I need to ensure there's no malicious intent there.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the combination of multiple process creations, registry modifications, and file accesses from known tools often used in attacks makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is high because several indicators point towards potential malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes and registry modifications, along with file creations by potentially suspicious commands.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
