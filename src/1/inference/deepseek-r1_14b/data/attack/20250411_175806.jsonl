{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system events to determine if it's interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. Powershell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. The command-line details might give a clue, but they're not provided in all cases. The fact that it's accessing the registry (like in event 4) suggests potential configuration changes, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nNext, there are several cmd.exe and reg.exe processes modifying the Registry. Specifically, they're adding entries to HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is a common method for malware to ensure it runs on each startup. The paths added (like C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe) don't look like standard system files, so that's suspicious.\n\nI also notice that whoami.exe was executed without any arguments. While this tool can be used by admins to check permissions, its use in conjunction with other scripts or processes could indicate reconnaissance activities or credential harvesting.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe events, they seem normal as it's an ELK stack component used for log management. The creation of .winlogbeat.yml.new files is part of its setup process, so that doesn't raise red flags unless there's unusual behavior elsewhere.\n\nThe conhost.exe process accessing the registry might be concerning since it's typically a UI-related host process, and such activity could indicate command-line attacks or script execution.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes are modifying the Windows Registry to add startup entries, which is a classic persistence technique. The use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with reg.exe for these changes adds to the suspicion. While there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution, the combination of events indicates potential malicious activity planning or attempting to establish persistence.\n\nI'm 85% confident that this batch shows signs of possible malicious behavior due to the registry modifications and process activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of processes modifying the Windows Registry, which could indicate potential malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms.
