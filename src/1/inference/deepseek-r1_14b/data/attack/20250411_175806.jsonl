{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175806.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see what we've got here. I'm looking at a batch of system log events from various processes on a Windows machine. The goal is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nStarting off, the first event involves powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is often used by admins but can also be abused by attackers. Then there's whoami.exe running—standard for checking user info, probably benign.\n\nNext, another powershell.exe access and a registry value set. That caught my attention because writing to the registry can indicate malicious activity, like creating persistence points. \n\nThen comes cmd.exe with a command line that adds something to the Run key in the registry. The path mentioned is C:\\Path\\estrutura_principal.exe. Adding entries to Run typically allows programs to execute on startup, which could be part of persistence mechanisms by attackers.\n\nFollowing that, more powershell.exe accesses and another reg.exe adding another entry to the same Run key with a different path. This repetition suggests someone is trying to set up multiple persistent points, possibly deploying malicious software components.\n\nThere's also a cmd.exe modifying the registry again. Then, reg.exe is used to add yet another entry, this time called entrada_principal pointing to C:\\Path\\pacote_temporario.exe. The varied file names and paths might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, conhost.exe writes to the registry too. Conhost is usually for console windows but can sometimes be a red flag if used with malicious scripts or commands.\n\nThen there are two events from winlogbeat.exe creating files in its data directory. Winlogbeat is likely part of their monitoring setup, so these might just be normal log file updates.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe) writing to the registry under different keys with varying paths suggests an attempt to install malicious software that persists across reboots. The repeated use of powershell.exe and registry modifications are red flags commonly associated with malware or attacker activities. \n\nThe confidence level is high because there's a pattern here—using multiple tools to write to the same area (Run key) and different files being added, which isn't typical for legitimate scripts or user actions.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of registry modifications using different processes (powershell.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe) adding entries to the Run key with specific file paths suggest potential malicious activity aimed at creating persistence points.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
