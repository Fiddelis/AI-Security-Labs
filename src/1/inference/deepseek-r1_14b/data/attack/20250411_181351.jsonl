{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this batch of logs to figure out if there's anything interesting here. So, I'm seeing a lot of events related to PowerShell and other system processes. First off, multiple entries show powershell.exe being executed with some command lines that look suspicious. \n\nLooking at the command lines, they have scripts that use Add-Type to load assemblies like System.Windows.Forms. That part is about capturing the screen into a bitmap file. The path mentioned is $env:TEMP, which is a common location for temporary files but could also be used maliciously. This kind of activity can be used in reconnaissance or exfiltration.\n\nThen there are instances where svchost.exe accesses registry values. Svchost is usually legitimate, but it's often targeted by malware to hide their processes. The fact that it's setting registry values might be an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAlso, several ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs could indicate the script is using .NET functionalities, which can be a red flag if these aren't typical for standard scripts running on the system.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell with screen capture commands and the registry modifications by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity. The confidence here is high because these actions are common in attack patterns, like screen grabbing being part of information gathering or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with potentially malicious command lines, including screen capture and file creation in temporary directories, combined with registry access by svchost.exe.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got a batch of system log events to analyze for potential malicious behavior. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the process events, I notice several entries where powershell.exe is being executed with specific command lines. The commands are using Add-Type to load the System.Windows.Forms assembly, which suggests they're trying to capture the screen. They create a bitmap of the virtual screen, draw it into a graphics object, and save it as a PNG file in the TEMP directory. This pattern repeats multiple times with different filenames like elemento_ativo.png, componente_principal.png, etc. That's interesting because capturing screenshots can be part of malicious activities like screen scraping or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe creates and deletes a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_iqj0msrw.t2i.ps1 in the TEMP directory. The creation is logged under FileCreate, and then it's deleted with FileDeleteDetected. This temporary script might be part of testing PowerShell policies or could indicate some form of script execution to bypass certain security measures.\n\nAnother event shows a pipe being created by powershell.exe, which is logged under PipeEvent. Pipes in PowerShell are often used for communication between processes, but they can also be exploited for command injection or lateral movement, so that's something to watch out for.\n\nThere's an event where the task is Execute a Remote Command and the process is None, meaning it might be triggered by another process. This could imply remote execution capabilities, which are common in attacks to gain control over systems.\n\nLastly, there's an image load event for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender, which seems normal as part of the antivirus software.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to capture screenshots and create\/deploy temporary scripts raises red flags. These activities don't seem to be standard user behavior and could indicate data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. The creation and deletion of a script file might be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving a long trace, while screen capturing could be part of espionage or unauthorized monitoring.\n\nI'm also considering the frequency: multiple similar events within a short period suggest a concerted effort rather than random actions. The combination of file operations, process spawning, and potentially remote commands increases my concern about malicious intent.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some of these actions are from legitimate scripts or tools using PowerShell for system administration. But given the repetitive nature of capturing screenshots and temporary script deployment, the risk is high enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe capturing screenshots and creating\/deleting temporary scripts indicate potential malicious activity such as screen scraping or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181351.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event: It's a PowerShell process with a command line that captures the screen and saves it as an image in the TEMP directory. That seems suspicious because screen capturing can be part of malicious activities like screen recording or screenshoting without user consent, which is often seen in ransomware or spyware.\n\nSecond event: Another PowerShell instance creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. This folder is typically used for profile data when running non-interactively, so executing scripts here could mean persistence mechanisms. Malware sometimes adds entries to startup folders to run at system boot.\n\nThird and fourth events: Both are processes (Powershell.exe and Conhost.exe) modifying the registry. Registry modifications can be malicious if they're setting up persistence or altering security settings. Conhost.exe is often used by attackers to execute commands because it's a legitimate Windows process, making it harder to detect.\n\nFifth event: Winlogbeat.exe creating a file in its data directory. This seems normal unless it's unexpected behavior, like unauthorized access or tampering with log files, but I don't see anything wrong here yet.\n\nSixth event: ApplicationFrameHost.exe modifying the registry. While this is a legitimate process for application frame hosting, unusual registry activity might indicate exploitation or malicious code injection.\n\nSeventh event: Calculator.exe making a registry change. This is odd because Calculator doesn't typically interact with the registry. Malware often uses legitimate processes to execute actions, so using Calculator for registry modifications could be an attempt to hide malicious activities.\n\nEighth and ninth events: Powershell.exe accessing process information and another process access. These might indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network, which are red flags in security.\n\nTenth event onwards: Chrome.exe making multiple registry changes and DNS queries. While some registry activity is normal for browsers, excessive modifications could be suspicious, especially if they're attempting to alter system configurations or hide processes. The DNS query might be trying to reach a command-and-control server, which would be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of PowerShell activities (especially screen capture and file creation), Conhost.exe and Calculator.exe making registry changes, and Chrome.exe's behavior could indicate a potential attack vector. These events don't definitively prove malicious intent, but they do present several red flags that merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell executing commands with potentially malicious scripts, Conhost and Calculator modifying the registry, which could indicate persistence or hidden processes. Additionally, Winlogbeat creating files and Chrome's extensive registry changes raise concerns about potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
