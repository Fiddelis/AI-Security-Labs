{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this batch of system logs is interesting or not for investigation. Let me start by looking through each event and seeing what's going on.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of events from chrome.exe with tasks like Dns query and Network connection detected. That seems normal because Chrome does a lot of DNS lookups and connects to various sites, so these alone probably aren't suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where the process is None, which might not be relevant or could just be noise in the logs.\n\nNext, I notice some PowerShell executions. Processes like powershell.exe accessing things via ProcessAccess and creating new processes (ProcessCreate) could be red flags because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement. Also, there are instances where Registry values are being set, which might indicate an attempt to modify system configurations or create persistence points.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that looks like it's creating a service using sc.exe. The command includes creating a new service named tarefa_principal and setting it to start automatically. Creating services is a common technique in malware for persistence, so this could be concerning.\n\nAnother event shows services.exe modifying the registry multiple times. Services.exe usually isn't associated with malicious activity, but if it's making unexpected changes, that might warrant closer inspection.\n\nThere are also events where various .exe files like cmd.exe and sc.exe are creating new processes or loading images. While these commands can be legitimate, their combination could signal something suspicious, especially when used in the context of service creation and registry modifications.\n\nPutting this all together, the batch shows multiple signs that might indicate malicious activity: use of PowerShell for process access, creation of services via sc.exe, and repeated registry changes. These activities don't necessarily confirm an attack, but they are significant enough to merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially malicious activities such as PowerShell executions, Registry modifications, and service creation using sc.exe. These could indicate command execution or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first event is about a process named tarefa_logico.exe loading the mscorlib.ni.dll file. That seems normal since it's part of the .NET framework, which is commonly used in Windows applications.\n\nNext up is estrutura_principal.exe loading clrjit.dll. Again, this looks like standard behavior for .NET processes to load just-in-time compilers.\n\nThen there are multiple events involving cmd.exe and other executables like conhost.exe, elemento_ativo.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, powershell.exe, winlogbeat.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe accessing registry values or files. Powershell is a red flag sometimes because it can be used for malicious scripts, but in this case, the events are about registry access and process access, which could be legitimate.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times with different log tasks. However, each instance seems to be performing standard operations like accessing registry values or processes, not executing commands or downloading files.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a new file. Winlogbeat is likely a tool used for log shipping, so this might be part of data collection setup, which is normal if it's being installed or configured.\n\nThe calc.exe and Calculator.exe entries loading urlmon.dll seem suspicious at first glance because I know that malicious actors sometimes abuse legitimate tools like calculator by adding extra functionality. However, in this case, the file path points to a system DLL, which suggests it's part of standard Windows operations.\n\nsvchost.exe is also flagged multiple times accessing registry values. svchost.exe is a known legitimate process used by various Windows services. Itâ€™s common for it to interact with the registry, so these events don't necessarily indicate malicious activity unless there's something unusual about how they're being used, which isn't evident here.\n\nAnother thing I consider is whether any of these processes are known malware families or if their names are commonly associated with attacks. The names like tarefa_logico.exe, estrutura_principal.exe, modulo_secundario.exe aren't familiar as common malware names. They could be parts of legitimate applications or custom scripts.\n\nI also check for repeated patterns that might indicate a sequence of malicious activities, such as multiple registry modifications followed by file creations. While there are several registry accesses and file writes, they don't seem to form an unusual pattern together.\n\nThere's no evidence of failed logins, encryption activity, or network connections in these logs, which are often indicators of compromise. The events are all about process creation and resource access within the system, which could be part of a legitimate application's lifecycle.\n\nIn summary, while some processes like powershell.exe can be used maliciously, the specific actions logged here don't show signs of suspicious behavior. There's no unusual file creation beyond expected log shipping tools, no unexpected network traffic, and all registry accesses seem within normal bounds for common system processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve legitimate system processes accessing standard resources like DLLs, the registry, and files related to log shipping. There is no indication of malicious activity or unusual patterns that would warrant investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
