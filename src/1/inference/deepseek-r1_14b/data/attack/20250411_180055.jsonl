{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, several entries show powershell.exe being used with Compress-Archive commands. That's a red flag because attackers often use Powershell for lateral movement or to execute malicious scripts. The fact that it's compressing files into zip archives in temporary directories might indicate data exfiltration or preparing for such activities.\n\nNext, there are multiple events where powershell.exe is interacting with system modules like Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive.psm1. This module is legitimate but could be abused by attackers to perform malicious tasks more discreetly.\n\nI also notice several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks in the winlog. These might not be suspicious on their own, but combined with the other powershell activities, they add context that something potentially malicious could be happening.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where conhost.exe sets a registry value. Conhost is often used by attackers to execute commands without being detected, so this action could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries showing process accesses and file creations in different user directories. These activities might be part of establishing persistence mechanisms or creating droppers for malware.\n\nWhile some events like winlogbeat.exe installing a config file or calc.exe loading urlmon.dll seem benign, the overall pattern of multiple powershell executions with suspicious commands stands out as concerning. The repeated use of zip compression and specific modules suggests a coordinated effort that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe executing Compress-Archive commands, potential malicious behavior with file compression in temp directories, and other suspicious activities like registry modifications.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. Let's see what each event is showing.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, there are several instances where powershell.exe is being accessed and created. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities like executing commands or downloading payloads. The command lines in some of these events show compression commands using Compress-Archive. That could mean they're trying to package files, which might be normal, but it could also be part of an infection process where files are compressed before being sent elsewhere.\n\nThere's a pattern here with multiple calls to powershell.exe doing similar things. It starts with ProcessCreate for whoami.exe and then moves on to powershell.exe accesses and file creations\/deletions in the TEMP directory. The fact that they're creating and deleting files quickly, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_t13oq01p.uuw.ps1, suggests script testing or maybe trying to evade detection by leaving minimal traces.\n\nThe events also show multiple Registry value sets, which could indicate attempts to modify system configurations or install persistence mechanisms. The file deletions after creation are another point of interest because attackers often clean up their tracks to avoid being noticed.\n\nI'm noticing that the command lines in some events don't have a process name but only a command_line, which might be an error or perhaps an attempt to obfuscate the process name. This adds to the suspicion.\n\nOverall, while these activities could be part of normal system administration tasks, the combination—especially the repeated use of powershell.exe for compression and file operations in TEMP, along with registry modifications—points towards potential malicious behavior. There's also the repetition and specific patterns that are common in attack chains.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially suspicious commands, including file compression and deletion, along with registry modifications. These activities may indicate malicious behavior such as payload delivery or system configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries from svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common system process, but it's often used by malware because it's allowed to run with higher privileges. So seeing multiple RegistryEvent tasks might be suspicious, especially if they're happening in quick succession or without a clear reason.\n\nThen there's Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. That seems odd because I don't recall Calculator needing to load URL-related DLLs. Maybe that's a red flag for some kind of malicious activity.\n\nNext up is winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is an Elasticsearch tool used for log shipping, so it should be doing file operations. But the path mentioned looks correct for its installation, so maybe that's not too concerning unless there's something unusual about the file names or paths.\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That process is related to Windows Shell and UI components. It’s legitimate, but again, if it's making unexpected registry changes, that could be worth looking into.\n\nAnother Calculator.exe event setting a registry value. If Calculator is doing this multiple times, it might indicate some tampering or persistence mechanisms being set up by malware.\n\nThere are several powershell.exe events: one setting a registry value and others accessing processes. PowerShell is powerful but often used in attacks for its scripting capabilities. Any process access could be an attempt to gather information or manipulate other processes, which is definitely something to watch out for.\n\nChrome.exe has multiple RegistryEvent tasks and ImageLoad events. Chrome itself is legitimate, but if it's loading unusual DLLs or making a lot of registry changes, especially without user interaction, that might be concerning. The DLL paths like urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll seem standard, but the frequency of these events could indicate something wrong.\n\nAnother Calculator.exe event loading an image. If Calculator is loading modules it shouldn't need, this adds to the suspicion that something's amiss with that process.\n\nMultiple Chrome instances accessing the registry repeatedly. While some registry activity is normal for applications, especially when starting up or updating settings, too many events could signal malicious behavior like keylogging or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother winlogbeat.exe creating a file, which as I thought before seems legitimate but worth noting if it's part of a pattern.\n\nMore powershell.exe accessing processes. This repetition raises the flag because attackers often use PowerShell for command execution and lateral movement within a network.\n\nThen there are two whoami.exe executions with process creation events. Whoami is typically used to display user information, so seeing it run without a clear reason might be suspicious, especially if it's part of a larger sequence of events.\n\nFinally, another powershell.exe accessing processes event. The repetition here is notable and could indicate ongoing malicious activity.\n\nPutting this all together: we have multiple instances where legitimate processes like Calculator.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and Chrome.exe are performing actions that might not be their usual behavior. The frequency of registry modifications and image loads, especially from processes known to be used in attacks, suggests potential malicious activity. While some events on their own might not raise red flags, the combination across multiple processes and repeated actions make this batch of logs particularly concerning.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including unusual registry modifications by svchost.exe and Calculator.exe, potential malicious use of PowerShell, and unexpected file operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
