{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that were provided in JSONL format. Each line is a JSON object representing an event. My task is to analyze all these events together and determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\n1. The first event involves powershell.exe creating a file: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. Creating files with PowerShell can be normal but sometimes malicious scripts use it to store data or malware.\n\n2. Next, there are multiple events from chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome often modifies the registry for settings and updates, so this might not be suspicious on its own. But seeing too many of these could indicate something else, like a script modifying configurations.\n\n3. There's an event where whoami.exe is run with the command line pointing to system32. Whoami is typically used to get user information, which can be part of legitimate activity but also sometimes used by attackers to check permissions or privileges.\n\n4. Then there are more powershell.exe events: accessing processes and modifying registry values. This stands out because PowerShell is a common tool for both admins and attackers. The command lines here look suspicious—running scripts like Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which I know is often associated with keylogging malware that captures keystrokes.\n\n5. Some of the events show powershell.exe loading various .NET framework DLLs. This is normal when running PowerShell scripts that use .NET libraries, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might raise a red flag.\n\n6. The last two events involve command lines with paths to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts. These are definitely concerning because keyloggers are used for malicious purposes to capture sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch has multiple instances of powershell.exe running potentially malicious scripts, creating files, accessing processes, and loading DLLs. The repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of malicious activity. While chrome.exe modifying registry values isn't suspicious on its own, the combination with other events makes the whole batch worth investigating.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that this batch is interesting for investigation because it shows signs of possible malware activity using PowerShell scripts to log keystrokes and create files.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities involving powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1), creating temporary files, and modifying registry values. These actions may indicate keylogging or other malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at the events one by one.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where powershell.exe is being executed with different command lines. Each command line has a path that includes \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". That script name sounds familiar; I think it's related to keylogging or capturing keystrokes. The fact that the LogPath is pointing to TEMP\\key.log suggests they're logging keystrokes, which is definitely something malicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances where different paths are used for Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This repetition might indicate that the attacker is trying to run this script from various locations or maybe different modules within their toolkit. It's a bit concerning because it shows persistence across different files.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are file creations and deletions related to PowerShell scripts in the TEMP directory. For example, a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_vjxqiy2l.jfv.ps1 is created and then deleted. This could be an attempt to bypass script policy checks or test if certain scripts are allowed to run.\n\nAnother thing I see is that powershell.exe is loading various DLLs like MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll, and urlmon.dll. These might be legitimate Windows Defender components, but sometimes attackers can misuse these by loading them in a malicious context.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file. Winlogbeat is usually for log management, but if it's creating files abnormally, that could be suspicious, though maybe not directly related to the keylogging activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are entries from conhost.exe and svchost.exe performing actions like registry changes and file operations. These are common system processes, but in this context, their behavior might be part of a larger malicious activity chain.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple executions of a keylogging script across various paths, attempts to create and delete temporary PowerShell scripts, and other system process activities that don't seem necessary for normal operation. This batch shows signs of potential malware or unauthorized access, especially with the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 which is a known malicious tool.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1 scripts from various paths, indicating potential keylogging activity. Temporary script creation and deletion suggests efforts to bypass restrictions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. So I have three events here that I need to analyze as a whole. Each event is in JSONL format, and each one represents an action where a file was created.\n\nFirst event: The process is 'svchost.exe', which is known for being a legitimate Windows process but can sometimes be used by malware because it's a generic name. The file path here is pointing to a system directory, specifically under NetworkService's AppData. That location is normal for some services, so I'm not immediately worried about this one. However, I should note the filename 'keyValueLKG.dat'—it sounds like it might be part of some legitimate Windows update or optimization process.\n\nSecond event: The process is 'winlogbeat.exe', which I recognize as part of the Elastic WinLogBeat tool used for log shipping. That's a known good process, so this file creation is probably normal unless the path seems suspicious. The path here is in the user's Downloads directory under a specific version folder, and the filename is '.winlogbeat.yml.new'. This looks like it's part of the installation or configuration process for WinLogBeat, which doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThird event: The process is 'powershell.exe', which is commonly used by both admins and attackers. The file path is in the Downloads folder again, specifically a text file named 'entrada_padrao.txt'. PowerShell is powerful and often monitored because it can execute scripts or commands. However, creating a text file from PowerShell isn't inherently malicious—it could be part of a script writing some configuration or data.\n\nLooking at all three together: Two are legitimate processes (svchost and winlogbeat), and one is PowerShell. The files created don't seem to align with typical indicators of malware. No executables, just configuration files or text files. Also, the file paths are standard for these operations—system directories and user Downloads.\n\nI should consider if there's any unusual combination here. For instance, multiple file creations in quick succession by different processes could be a pattern worth noting, but individually they don't seem suspicious enough. There's no evidence of privilege escalation attempts or creation of files in restricted areas beyond what's normal for these tools.\n\nTherefore, while I'm cautious because of the use of svchost and PowerShell, which are common attack vectors, each event on its own doesn't indicate malicious activity. The combination isn't raising any red flags either.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by known processes like svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe, with no indication of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
