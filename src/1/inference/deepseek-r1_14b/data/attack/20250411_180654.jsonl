{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a batch of system log events from different processes. The first thing that stands out is the multiple entries involving `powershell.exe`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for legitimate scripting, but it can also be abused for malicious activities.\n\nI notice several instances where `powershell.exe` is executed with command lines pointing to script files like `Get-Keystrokes.ps1`. These scripts are named in a way that suggests they might capture keystrokes, which is a common tactic in keylogging malware. The fact that the `-LogPath` parameter is set to `$env:TEMP\\key.log` means the logs would be stored temporarily, possibly exfiltrated later.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple `RegistryEvent` tasks from `chrome.exe`. While Chrome accessing registry keys isn't unusual, repeated writes could indicate suspicious activity, especially if they're modifying sensitive areas that don't align with normal browser operations.\n\nThere's also an instance where `whoami.exe` is run. This tool is often used to determine user information, which in the wrong hands can be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation tactics.\n\nThe numerous image load events from `powershell.exe` loading various DLLs could be part of legitimate operations, but combined with the other indicators, it raises concerns about potential malicious scripts being executed.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell to execute potentially harmful scripts, along with unusual registry modifications and user information retrieval, creates a concerning pattern. These activities don't align with typical benign behavior and could indicate a cyberattack in progress.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing potentially malicious scripts (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) designed to capture keystrokes, along with suspicious registry modifications and process activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. \n\nFirst, I see three separate JSONL entries. Each one has a process name, a winlog task, and a file path.\n\nLooking at the first event: svchost.exe created a file at 'C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat'. Svchost is a common system process, so it's not unusual for it to create files in such directories. This doesn't raise any red flags immediately.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is likely an ELK stack component used for log shipping. It's common for such tools to create configuration files, especially during setup or updates. The presence of a .yml file suggests it's part of the configuration process, which is normal.\n\nThe third event is powershell.exe creating 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_padrao.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, in this case, it's simply creating a file. Without more context—like unusual command lines or writes to unexpected locations—it might not indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the entire batch together: all events are about files being created. Each process (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) is performing normal operations related to their standard functions. There's no indication of privilege escalation, multiple suspicious processes, or unusual file paths that would suggest a breach or attack.\n\nI should also consider if there's any pattern across the events. All are under the same user (fiddelis), and all files are in download directories or system-related folders. This doesn't show signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\nIn conclusion, while each event on its own could be checked for anomalies, together they don't present a cohesive narrative of malicious behavior. They seem to be part of normal system operations and software setup activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file creation activities by common processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) in standard locations, indicating routine system behavior rather than malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first four events, all of them are powershell.exe processes executing scripts with paths like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\". These scripts are being run from various locations on the system. The command lines show that they're writing keystrokes to a log file in the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because capturing keystrokes is a common tactic for malware to steal information.\n\nThe fifth event shows powershell.exe loading MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That's normal and not concerning on its own. The sixth event creates a PowerShell script test file, but then it's immediately deleted in the seventh event. This back-and-forth might be an attempt to bypass some security policies by checking if scripts can execute.\n\nThe eighth event shows a pipe being created, which is standard for inter-process communication but could also be used maliciously. The ninth event again runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from another path. There are multiple instances of this script being executed from different locations, which is unusual and might indicate it's part of a larger campaign.\n\nThe tenth to thirteenth events involve loading various DLLs and creating files in user directories. These could be related but don't stand out as malicious on their own. The fourteenth event has conhost.exe modifying the registry, which is another red flag because conhost is often used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThe fifteenth event again runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 via a remote command. This suggests that the script might be part of a remote execution chain, possibly indicating a larger attack vector. The last two events are about file creation by winlogbeat.exe and svchost.exe, which seem unrelated to malicious activities.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple instances of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed in different ways, deletions of script test files, and registry modifications. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity, especially since the script is designed to capture keystrokes. The repetition across different paths and processes makes me confident that this batch should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is known for keylogging activity. The script attempts to write logs to %TEMP%, and there are repeated file creation\/deletion patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
