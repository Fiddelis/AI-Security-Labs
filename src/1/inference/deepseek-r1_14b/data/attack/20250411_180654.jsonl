{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several entries where PowerShell.exe is the process involved. This catches my attention because PowerShell can be a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. The command lines in some events show that PowerShell is executing script files like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The fact that these scripts are being run from different paths, such as C:\\...\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1, might indicate that they're part of a campaign or multiple attempts to execute similar malicious scripts.\n\nLooking further, there's an event where whoami.exe is executed. While this command itself isn't inherently suspicious, it's often used by attackers to gather information about the system, which could be a precursor to more malicious activities. The combination with other PowerShell executions makes me more cautious.\n\nAnother point of interest are the repeated Registry value set events from chrome.exe. Although Chrome can make registry changes during normal operation, multiple such events might suggest something is amiss. However, without additional context, it's hard to say if this is part of legitimate activity or an attempt to modify system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThe numerous Image Load events from PowerShell loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clrjit.dll are also notable. These could be normal operations for PowerShell, but they might also be indicators of a script executing in memory, potentially avoiding traditional file-based detection methods.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple events with similar command lines that invoke Get-Keystrokes.ps1 from different paths suggests a pattern. This repetition might indicate automated attempts or multiple instances of malicious activity trying to execute these scripts, possibly as part of a larger campaign.\n\nConsidering all these points together—the use of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, the use of whoami.exe for system information, and repeated registry modifications—there's a strong indication that this batch of events could be related to malicious behavior. The combination of different activities from the same or related processes adds up to something that would require further investigation.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of events suggests possible unauthorized access, data collection (like keystrokes), and system configuration changes, all of which are red flags for cybersecurity. The confidence level is high because multiple indicators point towards potential malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell executing potentially malicious scripts, combined with system information gathering (whoami.exe) and repeated registry modifications, suggest possible unauthorized activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format. My job is to analyze the entire batch and determine whether it's interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. I need to return a single classification with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening here. \n\nLooking at the first event: It's a process named powershell.exe executing a command line script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. This script is supposed to log keystrokes into a file located in the TEMP directory. That immediately raises a red flag because such scripts are often used for keylogging, which is malicious.\n\nThe next few events show powershell.exe loading various DLLs and creating or deleting files. Some of these are legitimate Windows Defender components, so that's normal. But then there's another event where powershell.exe deletes a file it created earlier. This could be an attempt to clean up traces, which is common in malware.\n\nThen I see multiple events where the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is being executed from different paths. This suggests that the script might be part of a larger malicious payload that's spreading across the system or trying to execute itself from multiple locations for persistence.\n\nThere are also some events involving other processes like conhost.exe and svchost.exe interacting with the registry, which could indicate an attempt to gain persistence by modifying system configurations. Additionally, there are file creation events related to a user's downloads folder, which might be unrelated but could be part of the malicious activity trying to blend in.\n\nI notice that winlogbeat.exe is creating files as well. This might be legitimate if it's part of log management, but given the context, I'm suspicious it could be involved in the attack chain, perhaps exfiltrating data or setting up logging mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together, the repeated use of powershell.exe to execute a keylogging script across different directories and the associated file operations suggest a potential malicious activity. The script's purpose is malicious, and the attempts to clean up after itself (deleting files) add to the suspicion. The fact that it's being executed multiple times from various paths indicates persistence.\n\nHowever, there are also legitimate system processes like Windows Defender loading DLLs, which might make some of these events appear normal at first glance. But when combined with the keylogging script and file deletions, the overall pattern becomes concerning.\n\nI'm not seeing any strong indicators of other types of attacks, like network communications or known malware signatures, but the behavior observed is consistent with persistence and data theft via keylogging. The confidence level isn't 100% because there could be legitimate reasons for some events, but the combination strongly points to malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing a keylogging script (Get-Keystrokes.ps1) across different paths, along with file creation and deletion activities, indicate potential malicious behavior such as persistence and data exfiltration. The repeated execution from various locations suggests a broader attack pattern.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
