{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are several entries from chrome.exe with network connection detections. Chrome making network connections isn't unusual because it's a web browser that needs to access the internet for browsing. So these might just be normal activities unless something else points to malicious behavior.\n\nNext, I notice multiple powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be used both for legitimate administration tasks and for malicious activities, so I need to look at what each instance is doing. \n\nLooking at one of the powershell.exe events, there's a command line that stands out: it's using powershell to download files from GitHub. Specifically, the code is using New-Object System.Net.WebClient to download a file from \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/...\" and saving it to the TEMP directory. This seems suspicious because downloading files directly from such URLs might indicate an attempt to retrieve malicious scripts or tools.\n\nAnother event shows that powershell.exe created a file in the TEMP directory with a specific name, and then deleted it shortly after. The creation of temporary files is common, but deleting them immediately could be a sign of trying to hide evidence, which raises red flags.\n\nFurthermore, there are several instances where powershell.exe accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. While some of these actions are normal for powershell scripts, the combination with downloading external files from potentially malicious sources makes this more concerning.\n\nI also notice that each download command is slightly different, targeting various repositories on GitHub. This pattern suggests a possible automated script trying to fetch multiple modules or components, which could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nThe use of raw.githubusercontent.com is a red flag because it's a common method for distributing malicious scripts. Attackers often host their payloads in such locations to avoid detection. Additionally, saving the file to the TEMP directory without any clear legitimate purpose (like installing software or updating) increases suspicion.\n\nIn summary, while individual actions might not be outright malicious, the combination of downloading files from suspicious URLs using powershell.exe, creating and deleting temporary files, and accessing registry entries points towards potential malicious activity. This makes the batch of logs interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are observed executing scripts that download files from GitHub repositories into the TEMP directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's dive into analyzing this batch of system events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. \n\nLooking at the first four events, I notice that powershell.exe is being used with DownloadFile commands pointing to various GitHub repositories. The paths downloaded are LICENSE.txt files stored in the TEMP directory. This immediately raises a red flag because PowerShell downloading files from external sources can be a common tactic for malicious activities like downloading payloads or scripts. However, sometimes legitimate software also does this, so it's not definitive yet.\n\nMoving on, there's an event where powershell.exe is involved in creating a file in the user's Downloads folder. The path seems generic, but again, without knowing more about what that file contains, it's hard to say if it's malicious.\n\nThe next few events involve chrome.exe modifying registry values multiple times. While Chrome does make some registry changes during normal operation, repeated writes could indicate tampering or attempts to persistence. It's something to watch, especially if these changes are out of the ordinary for the user's typical browsing habits.\n\nThen there's an event showing a file creation by powershell.exe in the Windows Defender directory. This is concerning because it suggests that the script might be attempting to modify or interfere with security tools. If this file isn't legitimate, it could be part of an attempt to disable or deceive antivirus software.\n\nThere are also some events where processes like conhost.exe and winlogbeat.exe are interacting with files and registry entries. Conhost is often used in command-line interfaces but can sometimes be exploited. Winlogbeat might be a monitoring tool, so its activity would typically be expected if it's part of the system setup, but any unexpected behavior could warrant closer inspection.\n\nAnother point to consider is the frequency of these events. The batch shows multiple entries related to powershell.exe and chrome.exe activities. If these are happening in quick succession or outside normal user patterns, it could indicate a coordinated attack or script execution.\n\nAdditionally, the domains from which files are being downloaded vary slightly but follow a pattern (e.g., \"estrutura_temporario\", \"objeto_padrao\"). This might suggest that the attacker is testing different repositories or trying to avoid detection by varying their sources.\n\nI'm also noticing that several events don't have file paths, which could mean deleted files or temporary storage locations. This makes it harder to trace and adds another layer of suspicion.\n\nIn summary, while some activities might be benign, the combination of multiple powershell.exe downloads, registry modifications, and attempts to interact with security tools like Windows Defender points towards potential malicious behavior. The repeated actions by chrome.exe could also be part of a broader attack vector. Given these factors together, it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes downloading files from external sources and modifying system configurations suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation. The output should be a single JSON object with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file called 'entrada_base.txt'. That's interesting because PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and creating files can be part of that. The next event is MpDefenderCoreService.exe detecting a network connection. That seems normal as it's related to security software.\n\nThe third event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file. Winlogbeat is likely an agent or tool for collecting logs, so this might be part of legitimate monitoring activities. \n\nLooking at the fourth and fifth events, powershell.exe sets a registry value and accesses another process. These actions are common in scripts but could be malicious. The sixth event repeats the winlogbeat file creation, which I don't find immediately suspicious.\n\nThe seventh event is RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. Again, this might be normal, but it's worth keeping an eye on. Then notepad.exe sets a registry value—this seems unusual for Notepad unless someone is using it for something specific, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe accesses processes and sets registry values. This could indicate script activity, possibly malicious. The cmd.exe command line mentions SCHTASKS to delete a task, which might be an attempt to remove scheduled tasks—something attackers do to clean up their traces.\n\nAnother cmd.exe event sets a registry value. That's another point of interest. Then schtasks.exe is used again with the same parameters as before, indicating repeated attempts or legitimate use but worth checking if it's part of automated system maintenance or something else.\n\nThe final events involve svchost.exe and cmd.exe interacting with the registry. Svchost is a common process but can be abused by malware.\n\nPutting this all together, I notice several red flags: multiple PowerShell activities, including command-line arguments that aren't clearly legitimate, attempts to delete scheduled tasks, and registry modifications which are often used in persistence mechanisms. These patterns suggest possible malicious activity or at least suspicious behavior.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be part of normal system operations, especially if there's a script running legitimate tasks. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But the combination of multiple potentially malicious actions and tools like PowerShell being used in ways that don't clearly indicate a benign purpose does raise concern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing processes, setting registry values, and creating files, along with attempts to delete scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe.

The user wants me to analyze all these events together to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. I'll go through each event one by one and see what patterns emerge.\n\nStarting with the first event: conhost.exe is involved in setting a registry value. Conhost is usually related to console windows, so it's not inherently malicious, but registry changes can be suspicious depending on context.\n\nNext up is powershell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers, but mere access isn't enough to raise flags yet. The third event has whoami.exe running without any unusual command-line arguments, which seems normal.\n\nI notice that powershell.exe appears multiple times with 'Process accessed' events. That's concerning because repeated access could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. Then there are several cmd.exe instances deleting registry entries under HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. This is a red flag because attackers often clean their traces by removing entries from the Run key to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, reg.exe is used to delete another registry entry. Using reg.exe for such operations might be part of an attacker's cleanup routine. The 'REG DELETE' command is a common tactic in malware to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nThere are multiple events where powershell.exe is started with '& {}'. This syntax can execute commands and sometimes is used to bypass certain security measures, making it suspicious. Additionally, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks associated with PowerShell, which could indicate module loading or activity that's worth investigating.\n\nThe later events show image load attempts for mscoree.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. While legitimate, in some cases, this DLL can be used by malicious scripts, so it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple instances of deleting registry entries, repeated powershell.exe activity with potential command injection, and unusual process creations. These behaviors could indicate a coordinated attack where attackers are trying to execute commands, access resources, and clean up their tracks in the system logs. The repeated use of tools like PowerShell and cmd for such operations is a common pattern in APTs or other malicious activities.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows signs of potentially malicious activity, so it's definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd.exe activities with suspicious command-line arguments, including registry modifications and deletions, indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The user has provided 20 JSONL entries, each representing an event from various processes.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of these events are related to PowerShell.exe. Specifically, there are multiple instances where the task is 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)' with different files being loaded. Then there's a file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which might be part of script execution or testing. There's also a mention of winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, which seems legitimate for log management.\n\nLooking further, there are events where PowerShell is accessing processes and modifying the registry. These actions aren't inherently malicious but could be signs of suspicious activity if combined with other indicators. The use of whoami.exe and cmd.exe without obvious malicious commands (like \/c without any command) doesn't raise too many red flags on their own.\n\nHowever, considering the sequence: PowerShell creates a temporary script file, executes it, then deletes it. This is common in malware to avoid detection by leaving no trace. The registry modifications might be for persistence or configuration changes, which are also indicators of potential malicious activity. Additionally, the repeated ImageLoad events could indicate that PowerShell is loading various modules or components, possibly obfuscating its activities.\n\nWhile none of these events alone are conclusive, the combination—especially the file creation\/deletion in Temp and registry modifications—raises concerns about potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. That catches my attention because PowerShell is often used in cyberattacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The events show different tasks: Process accessed, Image loaded, and even File created and deleted. Notably, there's a file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1 being created and then immediately deleted. This could be an attempt to test the system's script policy or perhaps delete evidence of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, I notice several Registry value set events from cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. While these are legitimate processes, unusual registry modifications can indicate potential tampering with system configurations, possibly for persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nAnother point is the repeated occurrence of 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks in the logs. This might be normal for certain services, but when combined with other suspicious events, it could hint at a broader activity sequence that's worth investigating.\n\nThe high frequency of powershell.exe and associated file operations suggests potential scripting or automated behavior. The deletion of the created script file shortly after its creation is particularly concerning—it may have been an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\nIn summary, while individual events might not be alarming on their own, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities, registry modifications, and file deletions raises red flags about potential malicious behavior that could merit further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activity involving powershell.exe, including registry modifications, loading of .NET components, and file creation\/deletion, indicate possible malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are a few Calculator.exe and chrome.exe processes creating pipes and setting registry values. That seems normal because those are legitimate programs, but the repeated registry changes might be something to look into. Maybe Chrome is just updating some settings.\n\nThen I notice multiple powershell.exe instances doing various things. Some create pipes, others access processes or set registry values. Powershell can do a lot of things, both good and bad, so that's a red flag. There are command lines showing different scripts; one uses Remove-Item to delete a zip file, which could be trying to clean up evidence.\n\nThere's also whoami.exe being executed, which is often used to get user information—this might be part of reconnaissance or to escalate privileges if combined with other actions.\n\nLooking at the files involved, some are legitimate system files like MpClient.dll and mscoree.dll. But others don't have file events, so it's hard to say what they're doing exactly.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple indicators that could point to malicious activity: unusual powershell commands, process access, deletion of files, and whoami.exe usage.

The user has provided a series of JSONL entries, each representing an event from system logs. My task is to determine whether the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these events involve powershell.exe. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but can also be abused by attackers for lateral movement and execution of malicious scripts. The fact that there are multiple instances where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs could indicate legitimate activity or potential malicious behavior.\n\nLooking at the specific tasks logged, there are several ImageLoad events for different DLL files. While these might seem normal, the combination with other actions like file creation and deletion in the TEMP directory raises a red flag. The creation of a temporary PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_1fin0tvz.r52.ps1) followed immediately by its deletion suggests an attempt to avoid detection. Such behavior is commonly seen in malware where malicious scripts are executed briefly and then removed to erase traces.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple Remove-Item commands being executed via powershell.exe, targeting specific files in the TEMP directory. These deletions occur across several events, each removing a different zip file. This pattern could be part of an attempt to clean up after executing some malicious payload or to prevent evidence from being found during an investigation.\n\nWhile there are also entries from chrome.exe involving registry changes and DLL loads, these on their own aren't particularly concerning unless they're part of a larger suspicious activity. However, considering the overall context with powershell.exe, it's important to look at the combination of events rather than individual ones.\n\nThe justification for classifying this batch as INTERESTING is the sequence of actions performed by powershell.exe—especially the temporary file creation and deletion, which could indicate an attempt to execute a script without leaving long-term traces. This behavior isn't typical of standard user activity and raises concerns about potential malicious intent.\n\nMy confidence in this classification is high because the pattern of creating and immediately deleting files in TEMP, combined with multiple file deletions from that directory via powershell.exe, aligns with tactics used by attackers to maintain stealth and persistence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell activity including file creation\/deletion and image loading suggest potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries involving PowerShell.exe. That immediately makes me cautious because PowerShell is often used for both legitimate scripting and malicious activities. So the presence of multiple PowerShell processes could be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the events:\n\n1. The first event has powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. I'm not sure if that's normal behavior, but it's something to note.\n\n2. Then there are several entries where powershell.exe is setting registry values and accessing processes. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms for malware, so that's concerning.\n\n3. There's a conhost.exe process also modifying the registry. Conhost is typically used for console windows, but seeing it set registry values alongside PowerShell might indicate some command-line activity or possible lateral movement.\n\n4. The next events show whoami.exe being executed. Whoami is usually harmless, but in this context, maybe it's part of privilege escalation or information gathering by the malicious script.\n\n5. Then there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is deleting files from the TEMP directory using command lines like Remove-Item. Deleting files could be part of cleaning up traces after some activity, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\n6. There are several \"Provider Lifecycle\" events for PowerShell. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it might indicate module loading or unloading, which can be normal, but combined with other activities, it's worth watching.\n\n7. The next few entries show powershell.exe loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That seems standard for PowerShell execution.\n\n8. However, there's a file creation and then deletion in the TEMP directory with a specific PS script name (__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1). Creating and immediately deleting a script file might be an attempt to bypass certain security policies or delete evidence quickly.\n\n9. Lastly, there's a pipe created by powershell.exe, which could allow for inter-process communication. This can be used maliciously to hide commands or exfiltrate data.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell activity, including file deletions, registry modifications, and process access. These actions don't look like typical user behavior. The repeated use of PowerShell along with these specific tasks—like deleting files in the TEMP directory and creating\/destroying a script file—smells like a potential attack. The combination could indicate script injection, persistence mechanisms, or efforts to remove traces of their activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because while some actions might be benign, the overall pattern suggests possible malicious behavior. However, I'm not entirely certain without more context on the baseline activities of this system.
