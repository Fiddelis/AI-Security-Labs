{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system logs to determine if it's worth investigating. I see that there are multiple events involving both Chrome.exe and PowerShell.exe.\n\nStarting with the first few entries, they're all from Chrome.exe and involve DNS queries and network connections. That doesn't immediately raise any red flags because Chrome is a common browser that makes such requests regularly. It's probably just normal browsing activity.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell.exe events, things get more interesting. The first event shows a command line with some PowerShell code. Specifically, it's using WebClient to download files from various GitHub repositories into the user's TEMP directory. This is concerning because downloading files directly via such methods can be a sign of malicious activity or unauthorized script execution.\n\nI notice that there are multiple events where PowerShell creates temporary files and then deletes them shortly after. For example, there’s a file created named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xyqllcdq.qlo.ps1 which is later deleted. This behavior might be an attempt to avoid detection by creating and then removing traces of the script.\n\nMoreover, each download command is pointing to different GitHub repositories with varying paths. The fact that multiple files are being downloaded from these repositories could indicate either data gathering or the distribution of malicious payloads. It's also worth noting that the URLs in the command lines have a pattern: they reference \"master\" branches and filenames like LICENSE.txt, which might be an attempt to blend in with legitimate traffic.\n\nLooking at other events involving PowerShell, there are registry value sets and image loads. These activities could be part of process injection or persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware to maintain access to the system.\n\nGiven all these points—suspicious file downloads from external sources, script execution, temporary file creation and deletion, and multiple instances of such behavior—I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting. The combination suggests potential malicious activity, especially since PowerShell is often used for such attacks due to its scripting capabilities and access to system functions.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether these activities could be legitimate. For instance, a user might run scripts or download files intentionally, but the volume of events and the specific actions (like multiple deletions) make it more likely that this is part of a malicious process. Additionally, the repeated downloading from different GitHub repositories adds to the suspicion.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all these factors, I'm confident enough to classify this batch as \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe executing scripts that download files from external sources and create temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several PowerShell processes. I notice that some have command lines indicating they're downloading files from GitHub repositories. Specifically, the URLs point to LICENSE.txt files in different branches like 'master' and 'unidade_logico'. This is a bit concerning because downloading files from external sources can be a common tactic for malicious activities.\n\nLooking closer, the paths where these files are being saved are under $env:TEMP with names like 'estrutura_temporario.txt' or 'tarefa_ativo.txt'. Temporary files can be suspicious if they're part of a larger script or payload. Also, the fact that multiple PowerShell commands are involved might suggest script execution.\n\nThere are several entries where 'chrome.exe' is setting registry values multiple times. While Chrome does interact with the registry for settings and extensions, repeated writes could be an indicator of something unusual, especially if combined with other events like file downloads.\n\nI also see 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a new YAML file in its data directory. This seems legitimate since it's part of log management, but the filename '.winlogbeat.yml.new' is interesting—it might indicate a configuration update or installation step.\n\nOther processes include 'MpDefenderCoreService.exe', which relates to Windows Defender, and 'RuntimeBroker.exe', both of which are standard system processes. Notepad and Conhost are also benign, typically used for basic system functions.\n\nThe events where PowerShell accesses files and registry values might be part of legitimate operations, but the combination with external file downloads could raise flags. Malware often uses such techniques to download components or execute scripts from remote locations.\n\nI'm also noting that multiple entries involve file creation in various directories, including temp and user-specific folders. This activity could be normal for some applications, but when paired with external downloads and registry changes, it's worth investigating further.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while individual events might not be alarming, the pattern of multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from different GitHub repositories, coupled with extensive system interactions like file creation and registry modifications, suggests potential malicious behavior. This could indicate an attempt to drop files, establish persistence, or execute malicious scripts.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Suspicious Processes:**\n   - Multiple entries of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments downloading files from GitHub repositories.\n\n2. **Analyze Downloaded Files:**\n   - The URLs point to `.txt` files, which might be part of a larger script or payload.\n\n3. **Examine File Paths and Names:**\n   - Temporary file names suggest potential temporary storage for malicious activities.\n\n4. **Check Registry Modifications:**\n   - `chrome.exe` making multiple registry changes could indicate unusual behavior beyond standard operations.\n\n5. **Review File Creation Events:**\n   - Creation of files in `$env:TEMP` and user downloads directory by PowerShell processes raises suspicion.\n\n6. **Assess Legitimate Processes:**\n   - Processes like `winlogbeat.exe`, `MpDefenderCoreService.exe`, etc., are benign but might be exploited.\n\n7. **Evaluate Overall Pattern:**\n   - The combination of external file downloads, temporary file creation, and system modifications suggests possible malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe batch of events indicates potentially malicious activity involving multiple PowerShell instances downloading files and making system changes. This pattern raises concerns about a possible attack or malware execution.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch of events is considered **interesting** as it exhibits signs of potential malicious activity, including multiple external file downloads by PowerShell processes and suspicious system modifications.  \n\n\\boxed{\\text{Interesting}}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are a couple of instances where calc.exe and Calculator.exe are being loaded. That seems normal since those are standard system processes. Then, svchost.exe is showing multiple registry value sets. I know svchost can be legitimate but sometimes used by malware, so that's something to keep an eye on.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe process accessed. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so any execution or access could be suspicious. The command line for cmd.exe has \"\/c SCHTASKS \/Delete \/TN spawn \/F\", which looks like it's deleting a scheduled task named \"spawn\". That might indicate an attempt to remove persistence mechanisms.\n\nAnother cmd.exe command is using REG DELETE to remove entries from the Run key in the registry, specifically targeting \"modulo_temporario\" and \"pacote_auxiliar\". These actions are often part of cleaning up traces after malicious activities, suggesting someone is trying to erase their footprints.\n\nThere's also a schtasks.exe process that creates or modifies scheduled tasks. If this is being used without proper authorization, it could be a way for malware to schedule malicious tasks periodically.\n\nConhost.exe and whoami.exe are showing up too. Whoami can be used by attackers to gather system information, and conhost might be part of legitimate processes but sometimes used in command shells that need to appear as normal.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern, there's a lot of activity around registry modifications and process creations\/deletions. This combination is concerning because it indicates possible attempts to remove traces (like deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries) which are common behaviors for malware trying to stay undetected. The use of powershell.exe multiple times also raises flags since it's often used in attacks.\n\nI should consider the context: if these processes are running without proper user permissions or during times when no legitimate updates are happening, they might indicate malicious activity. Additionally, the repetitive nature of registry edits and task deletions suggests a deliberate effort to maintain persistence or erase evidence.\n\nTherefore, while some individual events aren't necessarily suspicious on their own, the sequence and combination point towards potential malicious behavior that's worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Event Analysis:**\n   - **calc.exe\/Calculator.exe:** These are standard system processes; no immediate concern.\n   - **svchost.exe:** Common but can be malicious, especially with repeated registry activity.\n   - **powershell.exe accesses:** Powershell is dual-use; multiple accesses warrant closer inspection.\n   - **cmd.exe commands:** Deleting scheduled tasks and registry entries may indicate efforts to remove traces of malware.\n   - **schtasks.exe:** Modifying or deleting tasks can be a sign of malicious activity aiming for persistence.\n   - **conhost.exe\/whoami.exe:** Used for legitimate purposes but can also gather system info maliciously.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - **Registry Modifications:** Multiple events show registry changes, often seen in malware attempting to clean up traces.\n   - **Process Management:** Deleting tasks and accessing processes suggests efforts to maintain persistence or erase footprints.\n\n3. **Behavioral Indicators of Malware:**\n   - **Excessive Registry Changes:** Indicates attempts to modify system configurations, often for malicious purposes.\n   - **Scheduled Task Deletions:** Suggests removal of persistent malware components.\n   - **Powershell Usage:** Common in both legitimate and malicious scripts; high frequency is suspicious.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of registry edits, process deletions, and powershell usage points to potential malicious activity aiming to avoid detection or maintain persistence.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events exhibits concerning patterns indicative of potential malware activity. The repeated use of processes like svchost.exe, powershell.exe, cmd.exe for deleting tasks and registry entries, along with schtasks.exe modifications, suggests efforts to remove traces and possibly establish persistence. This behavior is often associated with malicious actors attempting to remain undetected or maintain control over the system. Therefore, these events are indeed interesting and warrant further investigation. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe log events show signs of potential malicious activity, including registry tampering and process deletion attempts, making them significant for cybersecurity investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events. They all seem to be related to PowerShell activities on a system. The first thing that stands out is the repeated occurrence of 'powershell.exe' being executed with command lines like '& {}'. That's unusual because typically, when you see powershell.exe being called, especially in scripts, it could indicate malicious activity.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice events where files are created and then deleted quickly. For example, there's a file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1' that's created and then deleted shortly after. This behavior is suspicious because attackers often use such temporary scripts to test if they can execute malicious code without being detected.\n\nAlso, the log shows several registry accesses and modifications. Registry changes can be a red flag because attackers might be trying to persistence their malware by creating entries so it runs at startup. The repeated 'Registry value set' tasks in the logs support this idea.\n\nThere are multiple instances of image loads for various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET framework. While these are legitimate system files, seeing them loaded repeatedly in a short timeframe could indicate that some malicious script is using them to execute code.\n\nAnother point is the creation of temporary files and their deletion. This pattern suggests an attempt to avoid detection by leaving minimal traces on the system. Additionally, there's a file related to PowerShell's StartupProfileData, which might be modified to hide malicious activities or load components during startup.\n\nI also see events from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating configuration files, but that seems less concerning unless it's part of a larger pattern. However, combined with all the other PowerShell activity, it adds to the overall suspicion.\n\nOverall, while some of these actions could be legitimate (like script testing), the combination—repeated PowerShell executions, temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and image loads—points towards potential malicious behavior. This makes the batch interesting for further investigation because each individual event might not be suspicious on its own, but together they form a concerning pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows repeated PowerShell activity with suspicious patterns including temporary file creation and deletion, registry modifications, and multiple image loads.

Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances of processes being created or accessed. I notice 'whoami.exe' being run a couple times, which is usually harmless but can be used to gather user info. Then there's 'powershell.exe' appearing many times— PowerShell is often used for both legitimate admin tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag.\n\nLooking deeper, the PowerShell instances show various activities: accessing processes, modifying registry values, loading images, and even file creation and deletion. Specifically, there's a script being created in the Temp directory and then immediately deleted. That behavior is suspicious because it could indicate an attempt to bypass script execution policies or delete evidence after running malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, there are events where 'cmd.exe' and 'conhost.exe' modify registry values, which might be part of setting up persistence mechanisms or changing system configurations for malicious purposes.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with different command lines and activities over multiple events suggests possible lateral movement, data exfiltration, or payload execution. The file creation and deletion in the Temp folder is particularly concerning as it could signal a script being executed without proper permissions or as part of an attack chain.\n\nConsidering all these together, the batch shows a pattern that's not typical user activity but aligns with behaviors seen in cyberattacks.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate administration tasks and malicious activities, so any unusual activity with it should be flagged. The logs show things like pipe creation, registry value setting, and process access events related to powershell.exe. That's a red flag because attackers often use these actions to hide their tracks or execute commands.\n\nThere are also several entries from chrome.exe creating registry values. While chrome can make changes to the registry for legitimate reasons, multiple such events in a short period might indicate something suspicious, especially if they're not part of normal browser operations.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event where whoami.exe was executed. This tool is often used by attackers to gather information about the system's user context, which could be part of an initial access phase or credential gathering.\n\nAnother concerning point is the command line in one of the powershell.exe events: \"& {Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore}\". This suggests that a script was executed to delete a file from the TEMP directory. The use of ErrorAction Ignore could mean the attacker is trying to suppress any errors, indicating they don't want to draw attention to this action.\n\nMoreover, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. While this can be normal, the sheer number and specific paths might indicate that a malicious script is being executed or an external payload is being loaded.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of powershell activity with file deletions in the TEMP directory, whoami execution, and multiple registry changes across different processes (chrome.exe, conhost.exe) suggests potential malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is something I should look into. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nI notice a lot of entries where the process is PowerShell.exe. That's not inherently bad because it's a common tool used both by admins and attackers. But the way it's being used here might raise some flags.\n\nLooking at the command lines in some events, I see commands like \"Remove-Item\" which are deleting files from the TEMP directory. Specifically, they're trying to remove .zip and .txt files. The paths mentioned seem arbitrary, like \"tarefa_base.zip\" or \"estrutura_comum.zip\". That seems a bit unusual because if these were legitimate processes, they'd probably have more standard names related to their purpose.\n\nThere's also a lot of file creation and deletion events. For example, one event shows a PowerShell script being created in the TEMP directory, then immediately deleted. This behavior is suspicious because attackers often delete traces of their activities to avoid detection. The fact that multiple files are being removed with similar naming conventions makes me think it's part of a pattern.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of \"ErrorAction Ignore\" in the command lines. This tells PowerShell not to display any errors if the file isn't found, which is a common tactic to prevent detection when deleting files that might not exist at the time they're being removed.\n\nI also see some events where other processes like chrome.exe and whoami.exe are involved. But the majority of the activity seems focused on PowerShell, especially around file operations in the TEMP directory. This focus suggests potential malicious activity because attackers often use legitimate tools for their actions to blend in.\n\nThe combination of creating a script (even if it's short-lived), deleting files with unusual names, and using command-line arguments that suppress error messages makes me lean towards this batch being interesting. The repeated attempts to remove various files from the TEMP directory without any obvious reason (like cleaning up after legitimate work) add to the suspicion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the events indicate possible malicious behavior where an attacker is trying to clean up evidence of their presence or perhaps attempting to execute some malicious script that's being removed post-execute. Therefore, I think this batch should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe processes are deleting files from the TEMP directory using unusual names and suppressing errors, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. \n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see multiple events involving powershell.exe. The command line arguments are scripts that remove files from the TEMP directory. For example, \"Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\\\unidade_base.txt -Force -ErrorAction Ignore\". This seems suspicious because PowerShell is often used by attackers for various malicious activities. \n\nI also notice that there are multiple instances of file deletions in different TEMP files like .txt files named with various terms. The same script deletes several files, which might indicate an attempt to clean up traces of previous activity. \n\nAdditionally, there are events where powershell.exe accesses the registry and loads images. These actions can be part of legitimate operations but also often seen in malicious software trying to hide or alter system behavior.\n\nAnother point is the creation and deletion of temporary PowerShell scripts, such as \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_v24whope.fom.ps1\". This could be an attempt to test permissions or avoid detection by using a script that gets deleted right after execution.\n\nThere's also an event where whoami.exe is run. While this can be benign for user identification, it might also be used to check the system context or privileges, which could be part of reconnaissance before more malicious actions.\n\nFurthermore, powershell.exe accesses several files related to .NET and Windows Defender. This activity might indicate that the script is attempting to load certain libraries or modules, possibly to hide its presence or execute malicious code.\n\nConsidering all these points together, the batch shows a series of events that could be indicative of suspicious activity. The repeated use of powershell.exe for file deletions in the TEMP directory, combined with registry access and image loading, raises red flags about potential malicious behavior. \n\nTherefore, I would classify this batch as INTERESTING because the combination of actions—deleting multiple files, creating temporary scripts, accessing the registry, and using whoami.exe—could be part of an attack chain or attempt to cover tracks.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file deletions in TEMP directory, creation\/deletion of temporary script files, and registry access suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Registry activity by this process isn't unusual either.\n\nThen there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' with tasks labeled as 'Process accessed'. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration and can be both legitimate and malicious. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could raise some flags, but without more context like specific commands or file accesses, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nI also notice 'whoami.exe' being executed a few times with its command line path.

However, repeated use could indicate someone trying to gather information about the system.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the data directory, which makes sense if it's running as a service for log management. The other file created by PowerShell is named 'pacote_ativo.txt', which translates to something like 'active package' in Portuguese. This could be part of legitimate scripting or might indicate some form of malicious activity, such as downloading and saving files.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are several red flags—like multiple PowerShell accesses and file creation—the absence of specific indicators of compromise (IOC) makes it hard to definitively label this batch as suspicious.
