{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple events from chrome.exe with network connection detections and DNS queries. That seems normal because Chrome is a browser that makes network connections regularly. So nothing suspicious here.\n\nThen I notice several powershell.exe processes. Powershell can be used for legitimate tasks but is also commonly abused by attackers. The first event shows ProcessAccess, which could mean it's being monitored or perhaps injected into. Then there are multiple RegistryEvent tasks where a registry value was set. That's interesting because modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nLooking further, powershell.exe creates a new process with some command lines that include ls -recurse and get-childitem, which are typical commands for listing files recursively. But the way they're written seems a bit off, maybe obfuscated? The script policy test file creation and deletion is curious too—it could be testing how policies apply to scripts, but it's also a technique attackers might use to bypass restrictions.\n\nThere are ImageLoad events loading various DLLs which is standard for PowerShell execution. But combined with the other activities, it raises suspicion. There are multiple Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle tasks, which might indicate that powershell is being used in a way that interacts deeply with system services, possibly for malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nThe Pipe Created event could be a sign of communication between processes, which in some cases can be part of command-and-control mechanisms. The repeated use of powershell.exe and the specific command lines make me think this might not just be regular scripting—it could be an attacker trying to maintain access or execute malicious commands.\n\nSo putting it all together: multiple indicators around powershell activities that are potentially malicious, including registry modifications, script creation\/deletion, and pipe creations. These actions don't seem necessary for normal operations, so the batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe activity, including potential malicious behaviors such as registry modifications and script creation\/deletion, along with other concerning indicators like repeated process accesses and provider lifecycle events.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the process is powershell.exe. I know that PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But in these events, some actions seem normal like loading MpClient.dll, which could be part of Windows Defender. There are also file creations and registry changes by PowerShell, but without more context, it's hard to say if they're malicious.\n\nThen there are entries from winlogbeat.exe creating files. Winlogbeat is an agent used for forwarding logs, so these activities might just be it setting up its configuration files. That seems normal unless there's something suspicious about the paths or frequency of these file creations.\n\nI notice a command line in one event: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\\\nget-childitem -recurse\\\\ngci -recurse}\". This looks like a PowerShell script that lists directories recursively, which is pretty standard for tasks like backups or scanning. It doesn't immediately raise red flags unless it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are several registry value sets by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe. Svchost is a common system process, but it can be used by malware. However, without seeing specific keys being modified, it's hard to assess. Similarly, RuntimeBroker is a legitimate Windows process, so its activity might just be normal.\n\nThere are also multiple logon and user account management events, which could indicate account changes or access attempts. But these alone don't necessarily mean something malicious; they could be part of routine system operations.\n\nConsidering the entire batch, while there are activities that catch my attention, like PowerShell usage and registry modifications, each event on its own doesn't provide enough evidence to classify them as malicious. There's a lot of normal-looking behavior mixed in, making it hard to distinguish between benign actions and potential threats without additional context or correlation with other logs.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as NOT INTERESTING because the activities don't clearly indicate malicious behavior when viewed together. However, there's some uncertainty because certain processes can be used for both good and bad purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system activities such as file creations, registry modifications, and legitimate process executions. While PowerShell is often associated with malicious activities, the observed actions do not indicate any suspicious behavior. The presence of logon and user account management events does not raise concerns without further context.\",\n  \"SCORE\": 30\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181320.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. Powershell is a common tool for both legitimate use and malicious activities. The fact that it's being used with command lines like '& {ls -recurse' catches my attention because it seems like they're trying to execute some script or command recursively over directories. That might be part of data gathering or lateral movement in an attack.\n\nThen, there are several instances where powershell.exe is creating files, specifically 'objeto_principal.txt'. Writing to a file could be normal, but combined with the other activities, it's something to watch. Also, the file path includes 'PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive', which might indicate they're trying to persist across sessions or store configuration data.\n\nLooking at registry events, both powershell.exe and svchost.exe are setting registry values multiple times. This is concerning because attackers often use the registry for persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations. The repetitive writes from svchost.exe in particular seem suspicious as it's a common process name used by various services, making it harder to track malicious activities.\n\nThere's also an event with RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. While this is a legitimate Windows process, the timing and frequency of such events could be red flags if they occur alongside other suspicious activities. Similarly, Notepad.exe doing the same might indicate that an attacker is using standard tools for malicious purposes, like storing data in plain text files.\n\nAnother point to consider is the presence of User Account Management tasks without associated processes. This could mean that there are attempts to create or modify user accounts, possibly leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. The 'Special Logon' event also stands out as it's often related to service account logons and might indicate an attacker trying to maintain persistence.\n\nThe use of calc.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting too. While this could be a coincidence or part of normal system operations, the combination with other suspicious activities makes me more cautious. Sometimes attackers use common tools like calculators for executing arbitrary code or downloading additional payloads.\n\nIn summary, the repetition of powershell.exe with command-line arguments that suggest scripting and file operations, coupled with numerous registry writes from multiple processes, raises concerns about potential malicious activity. The variety of legitimate-looking processes involved makes it harder to detect but also points towards possible attack vectors like persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of log events is deemed **interesting** due to several red flags indicative of potential malicious activities.\n\n- **Powershell.exe Activity**: Multiple instances show Powershell executing scripts and creating files, which could be part of data gathering or persistence mechanisms.\n- **Registry Modifications**: Frequent registry writes by powershell.exe, svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and Notepad.exe suggest possible persistence or system configuration changes.\n- **User Account Management**: Events without associated processes may indicate unauthorized account modifications.\n- **Legitimate Tools Abuse**: Use of tools like calc.exe and notepad.exe for potentially malicious purposes.\n\nThese factors collectively point to potential security concerns."}
