{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180202.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm seeing multiple events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are often used in scripting and can be red flags for malicious activity. There are several instances where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies the registry, like when it sets a registry value. Also, cmd.exe is being used to create a new process via wmic, which could indicate an attempt to run arbitrary commands or execute files. The creation of files in user directories, such as 'objeto_temporario.txt', might be part of data exfiltration or creating persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the use of WMIC.exe loading various DLLs could be signs of attempts to hide malicious activities or to load components that are harder to detect. Notably, there's an attempt to create a notepad.exe process, which is common in testing for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network. The overall pattern suggests potential exploitation attempts using these tools, making the batch relevant for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving powershell.exe and cmd.exe indicate potential malicious activity, including registry modifications and file creation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
