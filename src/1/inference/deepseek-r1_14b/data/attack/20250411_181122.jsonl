I'm looking at each event to understand what's happening on the system.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is being used with specific command lines. The command lines include searching for keywords like \"pass\" in various file types using findstr and select-string. This seems suspicious because PowerShell is often a tool attackers use to execute commands. Searching for sensitive terms across files could indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of Registry value sets by processes like powershell.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, etc. Modifying the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to maintain access to systems after reboots. This adds to my concern.\n\nOther events include file creations and image loads that seem normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, they might be part of a larger campaign. There's also a Dns query from OfficeClickToRun.exe, which could be related to communication with external servers, possibly command-and-control (C2) activity.\n\nThe process create and access events for various executables like Calculator.exe and chrome.exe don't stand out on their own but when combined with the PowerShell activities, they might indicate legitimate processes being used maliciously or part of a multi-faceted attack vector.\n\nOverall, the repeated use of PowerShell with specific commands, registry modifications, and other potentially suspicious activities suggest a high likelihood of malicious behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at what each event contains.\n\nMost of the events are from 'chrome.exe', and they're repeating similar tasks like setting registry values, DNS queries, loading images, and network connections. These activities seem normal for a browser process because Chrome does interact with registries to store settings, query DNS for domains, load various DLLs for functionality, and connect to networks for browsing.\n\nThere are some variations though. For example, there's an event from 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in its own directory, which is likely the log file it generates—nothing suspicious there. Then there's a file creation by 'powershell.exe' naming 'objeto_logico.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes. However, without more context, like what's inside that file or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThe majority of the events are repetitive and typical for a running Chrome instance. The only outlier is the new file created by PowerShell. But since there's no indication of other suspicious behaviors linked to it (like multiple writes, deletions, or network communications), I'm leaning towards it being part of normal user activity, perhaps saving some content from the web.\n\nConsidering all events together, they don't show any clear signs of malicious behavior. The repetition and types of tasks are consistent with standard operations of a browser and log generation tools. Therefore, this batch doesn't seem to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are mostly repetitive and typical for a running Chrome process, including registry modifications, DNS queries, image loads, and network connections.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the events involve multiple instances of powershell.exe being executed with specific command lines. The command line in some events is doing a search for certain keywords like \"pass\" across various file types such as .xml, .doc, .txt, and .xls. This kind of activity stands out because PowerShell is often used by attackers for scripting and can be a vector for malicious activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are instances where files are being created and then deleted shortly after. Specifically, a temporary script named __PSScriptPolicyTest_tdvmlspu.t01.ps1 is created in the user's AppData directory and then deleted. This behavior could indicate an attempt to bypass certain security policies or test if scripts can be executed without raising alarms.\n\nThe events also show several registry value sets and image loads, which are common during script execution as components are loaded into memory. However, combined with the file creation and deletion, these actions might suggest that the script is attempting something more nefarious, like persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother point to consider is the repeated execution of similar commands. This repetition could be part of a larger script trying different approaches or multiple attempts to achieve a goal, which is often seen in attack campaigns where attackers test various methods to remain undetected.\n\nLooking at the process names and command lines together, it's clear that powershell.exe is being used with specific arguments that search for sensitive information. This pattern raises concerns about potential data theft or unauthorized access attempts.\n\nFurthermore, the deletion of the created file immediately after its creation might be an attempt to cover tracks, making it harder to detect malicious activity by leaving fewer traces behind.\n\nTaking all these factors into account—the use of PowerShell for potentially harmful scripting, file operations that suggest test or cleanup activities, and repetitive behavior—it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting. The confidence level is high because the combination of actions aligns with common attack tactics like credential harvesting, persistence establishment, or lateral movement.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances executing suspicious scripts searching for sensitive keywords in various file types.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. I'm going through each event one by one and see if there's anything malicious or unusual.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file. That seems normal since it's likely the log shipping agent.\n2. `powershell.exe` creating a file named `estrutura_ativo.txt`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so I need to be cautious here. The filename doesn't immediately raise flags, but it's worth noting.\n3. There's an empty event with \"None\" fields; probably irrelevant noise.\n4. Again, `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file in the same path as before—nothing suspicious there.\n5. `powershell.exe` accessing a process. This could be part of legitimate scripting or potentially malicious activity. Not enough info yet.\n6. `whoami.exe` running from system32, which is normal since it's a built-in tool to check user information.\n7. Another `powershell.exe` accessing a process.\n8. `powershell.exe` setting a registry value. Registry modifications can be part of persistence mechanisms, so this could be concerning.\n9. `cmd.exe` running a command to delete scheduled tasks and redirecting output. The use of `schtasks \/delete` suggests deletion of scheduled tasks, which is often seen in attacks to remove traces or disable security features. Also, the command is executed with `\/f`, which forces deletion without confirmation. This could be malicious.\n10. Another process creation for `cmd.exe`.\n11. More instances of `schtasks.exe` deleting tasks and loading the `taskschd.dll`. Repeated deletions of scheduled tasks might indicate an attempt to remove monitoring or security-related tasks, which is a red flag.\n12. `svchost.exe` modifying the registry. `svchost` is often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. Registry changes here could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n13. Additional events where `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are accessing or modifying processes and registries.\n\nLooking at all these together, there's a pattern of process creations, file operations, and registry modifications involving multiple potentially suspicious activities like deleting scheduled tasks and using PowerShell for process access and registry changes. These could be indicators of an attack attempting to remove traces, disable security tools, or establish persistence. The repeated use of `schtasks` to delete tasks is particularly concerning as it's a common tactic in APTs.\n\nHowever, I'm not seeing any direct evidence of malicious payloads or known malware signatures. It's possible that some of these activities are part of legitimate system administration or automated scripts. But considering the combination—especially the repeated deletions and registry modifications—it leans towards something that might require further investigation to rule out potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected, including repeated deletion of scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe, use of cmd.exe with potentially malicious commands, and registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events. There's a lot going on here with various processes and registry changes.\n\nFirst, multiple entries show command-line tools like cmd.exe, net.exe, sc.exe being used to delete users or services. That could indicate someone trying to remove accounts or disable services, which might be malicious.\n\nI also notice several instances where powershell.exe is involved. PowerShell can be a red flag because it's often used for scripting and has administrative capabilities. The fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe is concerning—it suggests repeated access attempts, possibly for executing scripts.\n\nLooking at the tasks, many of them involve registry modifications. Registry changes can be part of persistence mechanisms or to alter system configurations. Services.exe modifying the registry might be normal, but combined with other actions, it's worth looking into.\n\nThere are a few ProcessCreate events for whoami.exe and cmd.exe with specific command lines. For example, cmd.exe is used to delete a user account in the domain, which could indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts. The use of 'sc delete win32times' suggests an attempt to remove a service, possibly to cover tracks.\n\nThe combination of multiple registry events from different processes and repeated PowerShell accesses makes me think there's a pattern here that might not be normal system behavior. These actions don't seem to align with typical user activity, so the batch is definitely interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple process creations and registry modifications involving potentially malicious activities such as account deletions and service removals.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst, there are multiple instances where cmd.exe is being used with command lines that look suspicious. For example, the first event has cmd.exe running a wmic process to delete notepad.exe. That seems odd because why would someone want to delete Notepad? It's a standard Windows app, so deleting it might indicate something malicious.\n\nThen there are several events involving powershell.exe accessing and modifying registry values. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate scripting and for executing attacks, especially when combined with registry modifications. The fact that powershell is being accessed multiple times and setting registry values could be a red flag—it's often part of persistence mechanisms or to elevate privileges.\n\nLooking at WMIC.exe events, I see it's being used to delete processes and load various DLLs. WMIC can be dangerous because it allows remote command execution and process management. The fact that it's deleting processes like notepad.exe could be an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt normal operations.\n\nThere are also events where userdel commands are run using net.exe and net1.exe, which suggests attempts to delete user accounts. This is concerning because deleting user accounts can lead to data loss or unauthorized access control changes, especially if done by someone without proper permissions.\n\nAdditionally, whoami.exe is being executed multiple times. While it's a standard command to check user information, repeated use without a clear purpose might indicate reconnaissance or testing of privileges.\n\nPutting all this together, the activities span across several potentially malicious behaviors: deleting processes, modifying registry settings, attempting to delete users, and using tools like WMIC and powershell which are often associated with attacks. The pattern suggests a possible unauthorized access attempt, privilege escalation, or data theft. These actions don't seem to be part of normal system operations, making the batch highly interesting for further investigation.\n\nI'm confident at around 0.85 that this batch is indeed worth investigating because multiple red flags are present across different types of events, indicating a coordinated attack rather than random or legitimate activities.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities including process deletions, registry modifications, user account deletions, and use of tools like WMIC and PowerShell suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where powershell.exe is being accessed or created. Powershell is a common tool but can also be used maliciously. I notice that several events show 'Process Create' and 'Registry value set'. That makes me think someone might be trying to modify system settings or create persistence points, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there's the cmd.exe process with command lines deleting temporary files. The paths mentioned are in the Temp directory, which is common for cleanup operations. But I'm wondering if these deletions are part of legitimate script execution or if they're covering up something malicious.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe running, which usually checks user information. That could be part of credential gathering or just a system check by an application. It's not inherently bad, but combined with the powershell activity, it might indicate more than just routine tasks.\n\nI see several events where powershell is being executed with empty command lines, like 'powershell.exe & {}'. This seems suspicious because usually, you'd expect some command after that ampersand. Empty command lines could be a way to hide malicious activities or simply test if the system allows such executions without raising flags.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there's an attempt to delete files in the Temp directory, like 'tarefa_secundario_calc_decoded.exe'. The fact that it's using del commands with redirection to nul might mean they're trying to suppress output, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid detection.\n\nThe events also involve registry modifications. Malicious actors often use the registry to maintain persistence or alter system configurations. So seeing multiple 'Registry value set' tasks without clear justification could indicate tampering.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some powershell.exe instances are loading various .dll files, which might be part of legitimate operations, but in the context of these other activities, it raises suspicion. Powershell scripts often load such modules, but it's worth keeping an eye on if they're being used alongside file deletions and registry changes.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple powershell executions with possibly empty commands, file deletions targeting temporary files, whoami.exe running, cmd.exe deleting specific temp files, and several registry modifications. These activities could be indicative of a malicious process trying to clean up traces or establish persistence. While some events might be benign, the combination suggests potential hostile activity that merits further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe execution with empty command lines and file deletions targeting temporary files suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that a lot of the events involve powershell.exe. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious, so it's definitely something to pay attention to, but on its own, just using PowerShell isn't suspicious unless there are specific actions taken.\n\nLooking at the tasks associated with these processes: there are ImageLoad, FileCreate, FileDeleteDetected, PipeCreated, EngineLifecycle, RegistryEvent, ProcessAccess, and ProcessCreate events. Some of these, like ImageLoad and ProcessCreate, can be part of normal system operations, but others like FileDeleteDetected could indicate something malicious.\n\nOne event stands out where a file was created by powershell.exe in the Temp directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. This seems suspicious because creating and then deleting a script file could be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence or to bypass certain security policies.\n\nThere's also the creation of a file in the StartupProfileData directory, which might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, there are several Registry value sets and process accesses involving powershell.exe, which could be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation techniques.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe being executed might be an attempt to gather information about the current user, which is common in recon activities. However, standalone use isn't necessarily malicious unless combined with other actions.\n\nAnother point is that some events are from winlogbeat.exe, which I believe is part of the Elastic WinLogBeat tool for log collection. That seems benign and might not be a red flag on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe processes, file creation\/deletion in Temp, registry changes, repeated process accesses, and whoami executions. While individually some events could be normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The deletion of a created script file is particularly concerning as it can be an indicator of obfuscation or attempt to remove traces.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is definitive evidence, but the pattern does raise enough red flags that further investigation would be warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation and deletion in Temp directory, registry modifications, repeated process accesses, and execution of whoami.exe suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: whoami.exe is being run with the command line pointing to its usual location in C:\\Windows\\system32\\. That seems normal because whoami is a standard Windows utility used to display user information. No red flags here.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessed. PowerShell can be both legitimate and malicious, depending on how it's used. However, the events just mention that it was accessed but don't show any commands or actions taken. Without seeing actual command execution, I'm leaning towards this not being suspicious yet.\n\nThen there's RuntimeBroker.exe accessing a registry event. Runtime Broker is part of Windows and handles things like app container services. It accessing registry values sounds normal unless it's doing something unusual elsewhere, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNotepad.exe also accesses the registry. Notepad is a simple text editor; while it can be used maliciously, just accessing certain registry keys without any other context doesn't raise alarms on its own.\n\nCalc.exe loading urlmon.dll is interesting. I know that calc.exe has been used in past attacks to execute malicious code by modifying its arithmetic operations. However, the fact that it's loading a system DLL like urlmon doesn't immediately suggest anything wrong. It could be legitimate for some functionality, though it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe accessing registry values. SvcHost is a generic host process for services; many legitimate processes run under this name. Without specific indicators of compromise (IoCs), I don't see this as particularly concerning.\n\nThere's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. Winlogbeat is commonly used for log shipping, so creating configuration files seems normal unless it's trying to write elsewhere or using improper permissions.\n\nAnother entry has ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessing the registry. This is related to Windows apps and their containers, so this activity doesn't seem malicious.\n\nCalculator.exe accessing the registry and loading urlmon.dll again—this repetition makes me wonder if there's a pattern. But without additional context like unusual file writes or network traffic, it's hard to say.\n\nLastly, several chrome.exe events: DNS queries and network connections. Browsers naturally perform these actions when navigating the web, so this is expected behavior unless they're connecting to known malicious domains, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting all this together, I don't see any single event that stands out as definitively malicious. Most of the activities are either normal system operations or involve tools (like PowerShell) that can be used both benignly and for attacks but aren't showing signs of misuse in this log set. While there's some repetition and potentially suspicious processes like calc.exe and Calculator.exe loading urlmon, without further context or additional events indicating malicious behavior, I wouldn't classify the entire batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal system activities with no clear indicators of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
