{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL logs here, each representing an event on a system. The user wants me to analyze all these together and decide if they're relevant for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to understand what's happening. \n\nThe first event is about powershell.exe being accessed. That's not too unusual because PowerShell is commonly used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But on its own, it doesn't mean anything suspicious yet.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run. This is a standard command that shows user information, so nothing wrong there. It might be part of some script or user activity.\n\nThen again, powershell.exe is accessed. Still, just access doesn't raise a red flag unless there's more context like unusual commands or multiple accesses in a short time.\n\nThe fourth event has powershell.exe interacting with the registry. That's a bit concerning because writing to the registry can be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. I should keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe fifth event stands out: it's another process creation for powershell.exe, but the command line looks suspicious. It includes creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That seems like an unusual service name and a complex path. Also, starting the service immediately after creation could be part of setting up malicious activity on startup.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for powershell.exe loading various DLLs. This is normal when running scripts that require .NET frameworks, so it's not necessarily suspicious unless these modules are known to be malicious.\n\nThere's a file created in the Temp directory named \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1\". Then, just after creation, it's deleted. Creating and deleting files quickly can be an attempt to avoid detection, which is a common tactic in malware to leave no trace. This behavior raises some flags.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a pipe by powershell.exe. Pipes are often used for inter-process communication, but again, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThen there are multiple Registry value sets from services.exe. Services can modify the registry when installing or updating, so this might be legitimate. However, repeated writes could indicate something suspicious, especially if they're modifying protected areas of the registry.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple powershell instances accessing the registry and creating\/starting a service with an unusual name and path, plus the file creation\/deletion in Temp. These are red flags because they suggest potential malicious activity like persistence (creating a service to run at startup) and possibly trying to hide traces by deleting files quickly.\n\nI'm also noting that the user provided events from both powershell.exe and services.exe, which could indicate different stages of an attack—like initial access using powershell for script execution and then setting up persistence via services.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while some actions are common, the combination—especially the suspicious service creation and file behavior—is indicative of malicious intent. Therefore, this batch should be classified as INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe accessing the registry and creating a service with an unusual name, combined with file creation and deletion in Temp directory suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": 85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if it's interesting or not for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few events, there are processes like services.exe and tarefa_logico.exe. Services.exe is setting registry values multiple times, which might be normal since it's a known Windows process. But I should check how many times it does this—there are several entries of the same task from services.exe, so maybe that's just part of its usual operation.\n\nThen there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs. The paths look legitimate, like mscoree.dll and others under the Microsoft.NET directory. This could be related to .NET framework components, which are common in Windows environments. So these might not be suspicious on their own unless they're being loaded unexpectedly or in large numbers.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive folder. That's concerning because attackers often use PowerShell for scripting and persistence. However, I should consider whether this is part of normal user activity or something more malicious. The path seems legitimate, but sometimes attackers create hidden files here to store configurations.\n\nThen, multiple events from powershell.exe setting registry values. Again, while PowerShell can be used maliciously, it's also a common tool for system administration. Without additional context like unusual command-line arguments or access times, it's hard to say if this is suspicious.\n\nLooking further down, there are several svchost.exe processes setting registry values. SvcHost is a legitimate process that hosts Windows services, so some registry activity isn't uncommon. But I should check if the number of events is higher than usual for this process or if they're modifying sensitive areas of the registry.\n\nAnother event shows a file being created by an unknown process (process name is None), which might be a red flag. The path points to a log file in WindowsUpdate, but since it's named with a date and time, it could be normal logging activity. However, without knowing what process created it, it's a bit concerning.\n\nLastly, MsMpEng.exe also sets registry values. This is the Microsoft Monitoring Process, which can have legitimate reasons for modifying system settings. But any unusual behavior here should be monitored closely.\n\nPutting this all together: there are multiple instances of known processes performing normal tasks, but some activities like PowerShell usage and file creation by unknown processes could indicate potential malicious activity. However, without more context or anomalies, it's hard to definitively say they're suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple instances of known legitimate processes performing routine operations, but also shows signs of potentially concerning activities such as PowerShell usage and file creation by an unknown process.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are from svchost.exe and involve registry value sets. Svchost is a common Windows process that can be tricky because it's often used by legitimate services but can also be abused by malware. The fact that it's making multiple changes to the registry could be concerning because attackers might modify registry keys to hide their activities or alter system configurations.\n\nThen, there are events from setup.exe creating various files under the Microsoft Edge directory. Setup.exe is typically associated with installing software, so these file creations might just be part of an update or installation process. The paths mentioned, like msedge.exe and related executables, seem normal for a browser's setup. However, I'm noticing that there are multiple such events, which could indicate either a legitimate update or potentially malicious activity trying to install components.\n\nAdditionally, there's an event from RuntimeBroker.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is another Windows process used for managing runtime services and resource management. While it's usually benign, any unexpected registry changes might warrant closer examination.\n\nLooking at all these together, while some events could be part of normal system operations, the combination—especially the repeated svchost.exe activity and setup.exe creating files in a non-standard path (like 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeCore')—might suggest something suspicious. Malware often uses such techniques to drop files or modify system settings without proper permissions.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as INTERESTING because of the potential for malicious activity, even though some events on their own might look innocent. The high number of similar events from svchost.exe and setup.exe could be indicators of a larger pattern that needs investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe, potential file creation activities by setup.exe in non-standard paths, and RuntimeBroker.exe activity may indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized system changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nFirst off, looking at the entries, most are from processes like svchost.exe, services.exe, and setup.exe. These are all system-related processes, which makes sense because they're part of Windows operations.\n\nThe events under \"winlog\" mostly mention tasks related to registry changes—either setting values or adding\/deleting objects in the registry. I know that legitimate software often modifies the registry during installation or operation, so this alone might not be suspicious. However, a lot of these events are from svchost.exe, which is a known process that can sometimes be used by malware because it's part of the system and doesn't raise flags easily.\n\nBut then, towards the end, there are some file creation events. Setup.exe creating files in Program Files (x86) for Microsoft Edge seems normal, especially if this is during an installation or update. The paths mentioned look like standard locations for applications. Also, the creation of shortcut files in the Start Menu and Quick Launch areas also aligns with typical software behavior.\n\nWait, but setup.exe also created a named pipe event. Named pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious, but it's something to note. If there were multiple such events or other suspicious activities alongside, it might raise an eyebrow. However, in this batch, it seems isolated.\n\nAnother point is that while svchost.exe and services.exe are involved in many registry changes, without additional context like unusual access times or patterns, these could just be part of normal system updates or configurations.\n\nSo putting it all together, most events look routine: registry modifications by known processes and file creations in standard locations. There's a slight increase in activity from setup.exe, but nothing that stands out as obviously malicious. Therefore, I'm leaning towards this batch being not particularly interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily consist of normal system processes modifying registry entries and creating files in standard locations. No clear signs of malicious activity are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this batch of events. First, I notice that a lot of the entries are from \"setup.exe\" performing registry operations and creating pipes. These could be legitimate activities during system setup or updates.\n\nThen there are multiple file creation events by \"svchost.exe\" in temporary directories. Temporary files are common during installations or updates, so this doesn't raise red flags on its own.\n\nI don't see any unusual processes or access patterns that would indicate malicious activity. The combination of these events seems consistent with normal system operations rather than signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist primarily of legitimate system activities such as registry modifications and file creations by known processes like setup.exe and svchost.exe.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the majority of the events are from svchost.exe creating files and setting registry values. Svchost is a common Windows process, often associated with services. However, multiple file creation events in the same path like C:\\Windows\\AppReadiness might be normal during system startup or updates, but seeing several identical paths could indicate something suspicious, maybe persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are events from powershell.exe being created and loading various DLLs. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for command execution and script injection. The specific command line here seems harmless—just writing \"Final result: 1\" to the host. But I'm cautious because even legitimate scripts could mask malicious activities, or maybe this is part of a larger sequence.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple file creations from svchost.exe followed by PowerShell execution. This combination raises flags because attackers often use svchost as a vessel for malicious activities and PowerShell for executing commands. The repeated registry writes might be setting up persistence or altering system configurations to allow unauthorized access later.\n\nI'm also considering if these events could be part of normal system operation, like updates or service installations. However, the repetition and specific file paths make me lean towards this being potentially malicious. I'm not entirely certain, but there's enough red flags here that warrant closer investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple svchost.exe events creating files in AppReadiness and registry modifications, followed by PowerShell execution with a command line suggesting potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events involve 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used for system administration but can also be abused for malicious activities. So my initial thought is that there might be something to investigate here.\n\nLooking at each event:\n\n1. The first event shows powershell.exe loading an image (MpOAV.dll). This could be normal if it's part of Windows Defender, which this path suggests.\n2. Next, a file is created in the Temp directory with a name like __PSScriptPolicyTest... . PSM1 files are PowerShell script modules. Creating such files might indicate script execution or testing.\n3. Then there's a pipe created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication but could also be part of malicious activity, especially if they're named in ways to hide the process.\n4. Another image load event for clrjit.dll, which is part of .NET framework, so that seems legitimate.\n5. Process access without a file might just be checking permissions or other processes.\n6. Loading MpClient.dll again, another Defender-related DLL, so that's probably okay.\n7. A new process starts with 'whoami.exe', which is a common command to get user information. However, since it's being executed in this context alongside powershell.exe, it might be part of an elevation check or persistence mechanism.\n8. Another access event from powershell.exe.\n9. Creating another file in the same Temp directory but different suffix; could be related scripts for testing policies.\n10. The next event is a Process Create with a command line that executes powershell.exe with some arguments. The script seems to be looking for .inf files and checking if they match a certain pattern, then outputting a result. This looks like it's querying system information or trying to gather data about installed drivers or services.\n11. More image load events from the .NET framework and other DLLs, which are standard for PowerShell execution.\n\nPutting this together, the batch shows multiple powershell.exe instances performing various actions: loading legitimate system DLLs, creating temporary script files, accessing processes, and executing commands like 'whoami'. The script in event 10 seems suspicious because it's checking for specific patterns in .inf files, which could be part of an attack to identify targets based on their OS version or installed components.\n\nHowever, these activities might not all be malicious. They could also be legitimate system administration tasks or automated checks by tools. But the combination is concerning because:\n\n- The repeated use of powershell.exe with different parameters and file creations in Temp directory.\n- The specific script command querying .inf files might indicate a pre-attack step like reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n- The creation of PSM1 files could be for executing scripts that bypass certain policies, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, if this were part of a legitimate audit or system check, it's possible. But given the variety and some atypical actions (like the script checking .inf files), there's enough reason to flag this batch as potentially malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because while individual events might not be suspicious, the pattern suggests possible malicious activity that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification: INTERESTING**\n\nThe batch of events involving multiple instances of `powershell.exe` performing a variety of actions, including loading system DLLs, creating temporary script files, accessing processes, and executing commands like `whoami`, raises concerns. Notably, the script querying `.inf` files could indicate malicious reconnaissance or lateral movement. While some activities might be legitimate, the pattern suggests potential malicious intent, warranting further investigation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"理由\": \"The events involve multiple `powershell.exe` instances performing actions such as loading system DLLs, creating temporary script files, and executing commands. The script querying `.inf` files is particularly concerning, suggesting potential malicious activity.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a set of JSONL events to analyze. My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not. Let me go through each event step by step and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the first event: It involves powershell.exe loading MpClient.dll. I know that PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks but can also be abused for malicious activities. However, MpClient.dll sounds familiar—Windows Defender uses this file as part of its operations. So, in this case, it might just be normal Windows behavior.\n\nThe second event shows cmd.exe being run with a command line that includes \"Dism \/online Disable-Feature...\" This command is used to disable Windows features. The fact that it's using Dism (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) could be legitimate for system maintenance. But sometimes attackers use such tools to remove defender or other security features, so I'll keep an eye on this.\n\nThe third event again uses powershell.exe but doesn't reference any file, just process access. This could be part of the initial setup or perhaps something more nefarious, but without a specific file being accessed, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow looking at events 4 through 14: They all involve Dism.exe creating and accessing various files in a temporary directory. The paths like C:\\Users\\...\\Temp are common for temporary files, but the naming of the files (like AppxProvider.dll, etc.) seems suspiciously specific. These look like they're part of a payload being extracted or executed.\n\nI notice that Dism.exe is running multiple times and accessing several DLLs and EXEs in the same temp directory. This pattern could indicate that an attacker is using Dism to execute malicious code or drop files as part of a larger attack. The repeated FileExecutableDetected events might be red flags, suggesting that these files are being recognized as potential threats.\n\nPutting it all together: The initial cmd and powershell commands to disable features (like Windows Defender) could be an attempt to lower the system's defenses. Then, using Dism.exe to create and execute multiple files from a temporary directory suggests that something malicious is being deployed. This combination of events—disabling security tools and executing potentially harmful code—is concerning.\n\nI'm confident enough based on these observations to classify this batch as INTERESTING because it shows signs of possible unauthorized system changes and the execution of unknown binaries, which are common indicators of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"REASONING\": \"The batch contains multiple events involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and Dism.exe performing actions that may indicate potential malicious behavior.

It's a legitimate Microsoft tool and typically runs during setup or updates. The events here show multiple files being detected, which seems normal when Dism is handling image-related tasks.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity like unexpected paths, unusual file names, or multiple failed attempts that might indicate brute force attacks. Since all the files are under a temp directory and named with standard provider DLLs, it looks like routine operations. There's no evidence of file hashes being flagged as suspicious or any deviations from expected behavior.\n\nConsidering the consistency and the nature of Dism.exe, these events are likely part of a legitimate process rather than malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show Dism.exe detecting files during routine operations; no signs of malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}

The process running is always Dism.exe, which stands for Deployment Image Service and Management tool. This is a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing Windows images. So, by itself, seeing Dism.exe in logs isn't suspicious.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, every event indicates \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. That suggests that something detected an executable file being accessed or executed. However, since this is a standard part of system operations, especially when dealing with image servicing, it's not unusual to see such events.\n\nThe file paths point to various DLLs in a temporary directory under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. The filenames include Provider.dll and similar, which are typical for components used by the DISM tool. These files are part of Windows' servicing stack and are expected when DISM is performing its operations, such as applying updates or configurations.\n\nConsidering all these events together, they seem to be a normal sequence of actions taken by DISM during system setup or updates.

Each one is pointing to different DLL files in the same temporary directory. This could be normal behavior since DISM is a legitimate Windows tool used for servicing the OS, including deploying updates and configurations.\n\nThe next few events switch to \"DismHost.exe\". The first of these has a command line parameter that looks like it's invoking DismHost with a GUID, which seems standard during system operations. Following that, several entries show image loads from the same temp directory as before, but this time for different DLLs used by DismHost.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here—like multiple failed logins, unknown processes, or writes to unexpected locations.

So, looking at the data, all these JSON objects are related and seem to be part of a single process.\n\nFirst, I notice that many events involve DismHost.exe loading various DLL files into memory. The file paths point to temporary directories with names like 'IntlProvider.dll', 'IBSProvider.dll', etc. This seems normal because DismHost.exe is known for handling system image management tasks and often loads several providers during its operation.\n\nHowever, after loading all these DLLs, there's an event where DismHost.exe terminates. That's a bit concerning but not necessarily malicious on its own—processes terminate all the time.\n\nThen I see that Dism.exe starts deleting files from the same temporary directory. The deleted files are some of those DLLs like 'AppxProvider.dll' and 'AssocProvider.dll'. It's normal for cleanup processes to delete temporary files after they're done, especially during system updates or maintenance.\n\nI should consider if these actions could indicate malicious behavior. Since DismHost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, and the actions (loading providers and deleting temp files) are standard operations, it doesn't seem suspicious. There's no evidence of unusual file names, access to restricted areas, or other red flags.\n\nTherefore, while the events are detailed, they don't collectively point to any malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of events. Let me start by understanding each event.\n\nEach line is a JSON object representing an event. The 'process' field shows that the process name is always 'Dism.exe'. Dism.exe is related to Windows Deployment Services, used for deploying and configuring Windows. It's a legitimate system process, so seeing it in logs isn't unusual on its own.\n\nLooking at the 'winlog' field, most events are about file deletions detected (rule: FileDeleteDetected), except one which mentions changing file creation time (FileCreateTime). The files being deleted all have paths under C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various DLL and MUI files. These temporary files are often created during software installations or updates, and it's normal for them to be cleaned up after.\n\nNow, considering the combination: multiple file deletions by Dism.exe in a temp directory. This seems like part of a legitimate operation, perhaps cleaning up after an update or deployment task. The only other event is about changing a file's creation time, which could be related to managing the files' metadata before deletion.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious behavior here. The process is known for system operations, and the actions are typical during cleanup processes. No unusual paths or excessive activity beyond what Dism.exe usually does.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events involve legitimate file deletions and modification times by Dism.exe in a temporary directory, which is part of normal system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on with this batch of log events. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing an event. The task is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're interesting or not for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, I see that each entry has three main fields: process, winlog, and file. Let me break these down.\n\nThe process field in every event shows \"Dism.exe\". Dism is short for Deployment Image Servicing and Management, which is a built-in Windows tool used for servicing operating system images. It's typically used during installation or configuration of Windows. So, seeing this process name isn't immediately suspicious; it's a legitimate Microsoft tool.\n\nNext, the winlog field indicates that there's a \"File Delete logged\" event with a specific rule: FileDeleteDetected. This means the system detected that a file was deleted. That in itself might be normal or could be something malicious, depending on context.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all of them are under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by a long folder name and various .dll.mui files. The paths end with different providers like IBSProvider, ImagingProvider, IntlProvider, etc., all under the en-US locale directory.\n\nSo, putting this together: Dism.exe is deleting several files in a temporary directory that seems to be related to Windows system provider DLLs localized for English. This looks like it's part of a legitimate process—perhaps during an OS deployment or servicing operation where old or unnecessary files are being cleaned up.\n\nI should consider if these actions are typical. Since Dism.exe is used for managing image services, deleting temporary files in this manner is normal. The fact that multiple similar events are happening back-to-back suggests it's part of a batch process rather than individual manual deletions.\n\nAnother point to think about: If an attacker were trying to delete files, they'd likely use more generic names or different processes, not specific system tools like Dism.exe. The consistency in the process name and file paths supports the idea that this is a normal operation.\n\nI should also check if these events are part of a known process. From what I know, during Windows setup or when using DISM to apply updates or customizations, it's common to extract files into temporary directories and then delete them once they're no longer needed. This would explain the multiple deletions in the same temp folder.\n\nIs there any reason to suspect something else? Maybe if these events were happening outside of an expected software installation or update process, but without additional context like timestamps or event correlation with other activities, it's hard to see any red flags here.\n\nIn conclusion, while each file deletion is logged and could theoretically be a sign of malicious activity, the consistent use of Dism.exe and the specific paths involved point towards this being part of a legitimate system process. There doesn't seem to be anything unusual or indicative of cyber threats in these logs.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events are part of a legitimate Windows system process where Dism.exe deletes temporary files during an OS servicing operation. These activities are normal and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Process:** Each event involves \"Dism.exe,\" a known Microsoft tool used for managing OS images.\n2. **Understand Event Type:** The events log file deletions detected by the system, which is part of routine cleanup.\n3. **Examine File Paths:** Files are located in a temporary directory under en-US locale providers, typical during servicing operations.\n4. **Assess Context:** Multiple deletions by Dism.exe suggest a batch process, such as during OS installation or updates.\n5. **Determine Legitimacy:** The pattern aligns with known legitimate activities, not malicious ones.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are part of normal system operations and not indicative of cybersecurity threats. Therefore, they are **not interesting for investigation**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"interesting\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"These events are part of a legitimate process involving the deletion of temporary files by Dism.exe during OS servicing or updates.\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's happening.\n\nEach line starts with the process name being \"Dism.exe\". I remember that Dism is a legitimate Windows tool used for image management—like installing, configuring, or updating Windows images. So that's a good sign; it's not some obscure executable.\n\nNext, the winlog field says it's a File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected). That means the system detected a file deletion event. But since this is part of normal operations for Dism.exe, which might be cleaning up temporary files after performing an image-related task, this doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nLooking at the file paths, all the events are deleting DLL files from a specific temporary directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some guid]\\*. The filenames vary but they all end with .dll and have names like FfuProvider.dll, FolderProvider.dll, etc. These seem to be related to different system providers or components that Dism.exe might interact with during its normal operation.\n\nSince all these events are from the same process (Dism.exe) and deleting files from a temporary directory, it looks like part of the standard cleanup after running a legitimate command. There's no indication of unusual behavior, such as multiple processes trying to delete files or accessing restricted areas. The repetition doesn't raise red flags because Dism could be handling several components at once.\n\nI don't see any evidence of lateral movement, unusual file hashes, or deviations from typical Dism.exe activity. The events are consistent with what I'd expect when cleaning up after using Dism for deployment or maintenance tasks.\n\nTherefore, the batch doesn't indicate any malicious behavior and is likely part of normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show legitimate file deletions by Dism.exe during cleanup in a temporary directory. This is consistent with normal operations.\",\n  \"SCORE\": \"0\"\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at this JSON data that seems to be logs from a system, possibly Windows given the process names like services.exe and svchost.exe. There are multiple entries with different processes and some commands being executed.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these logs have \"process\" fields with specific executables and \"winlog\" events indicating tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, etc. The files involved seem to be system-related, such as taskschd.dll which is part of the Task Scheduler.\n\nThen there are several entries where a PowerShell command is being executed. The command creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and sets its binary path to a specific .exe file. This is repeated multiple times, so it's likely an automated script or some malicious activity trying to establish persistence on the system by creating a service.\n\nI'm concerned because creating services via PowerShell can be a way for attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. The repeated attempts suggest either testing different ways to execute or possibly failed attempts due to errors or security measures blocking them.\n\nLooking at the timestamps, they're all set to 2023-10-30T14:06:00Z, which is the same time for each log entry. This might mean that these events are being logged in a batch process or it could indicate tampering if real logs have varying times.\n\nThe file paths mentioned, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\", seem to point to locations on the local drive. If this path is correct and accessible, it might be a legitimate application directory, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI also see some fields with \"None\" values for processes or files, which probably means that in those cases, there wasn't an associated file or process information available at the time of logging.\n\nOverall, while I'm not fully certain, the repeated PowerShell commands creating services are red flags. This kind of activity can be used maliciously to create backdoors or ensure continued access after a system restart. It would be wise to investigate these processes further, check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a known service, and scan for any signs of malware on the system.\n\nI might also consider reviewing recent changes in system policies, checking for unauthorized user activity, and ensuring that all system updates are up-to-date. If I were managing this system, I would run an antivirus scan immediately and possibly look into logs from other sources to correlate this activity with other events.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided JSON data represents logs of various system activities. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n1. **Multiple PowerShell Command Executions:**\n   - Several entries show that a PowerShell command is executed, creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it. The binary path points to `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n2. **Process Creation Events:**\n   - Processes like `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are started, which are common system processes.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications:**\n   - Entries indicate that registry values were set, which is typical for services and configurations.\n\n4. **Image Loading:**\n   - The Task Scheduler DLL (`taskschd.dll`) was loaded into memory, which is a standard system operation.\n\n5. **None Fields:**\n   - Some entries have \"None\" indicating missing or irrelevant process\/file information.\n\n**Key Concerns:**\n\n- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The repeated PowerShell commands suggest automated or malicious script execution.\n- **Service Creation:** Creating services can be a method for attackers to maintain persistence on the system.\n- **Timestamp Anomaly:** All logs have the same timestamp, which may indicate a batch log generation or potential tampering.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- **Investigate Services:** Check if \"objeto_ativo\" is a legitimate service or unauthorized.\n- **Review Logs:** Look for patterns and correlate with other logs to understand the context of these activities.\n- **Scan System:** Perform an antivirus scan to detect any malware.\n- **Update Policies:** Review system policies and ensure security measures are in place.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs indicate possible malicious activity using PowerShell to create services. Immediate investigation is recommended to secure the system and prevent potential threats."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that someone has given me. They're in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. My job is to figure out if the entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nFirst off, I'll start by going through each event one by one to see what's happening. The first event has a command_line that looks like it's running PowerShell with some arguments. The command is creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and setting its binary path to a specific .exe file. Then it starts the service. That seems a bit concerning because creating services can be a way for malware to persist on a system.\n\nThe next events, from line 2 onwards, are all similar. They're running PowerShell with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted and then executing some command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host. The task in these cases is either \"Engine Lifecycle\" or \"Provider Lifecycle.\" I'm wondering why there are so many identical commands. Maybe it's part of a script trying different things, but using restricted execution policies might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nLooking further into line 2-7 and then again from lines 9 onwards, the command is checking for specific patterns in .inf files located in the Windows directory. The regex pattern \\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\] suggests they're looking for installation sections in INF files, which are typically used during driver installations. This could be an attempt to detect or enumerate installed drivers, possibly malicious ones.\n\nI'm noticing that many of these events are repeated multiple times. The same command lines appear several times across different tasks. This repetition might indicate a script running multiple checks or trying to avoid detection by spreading the activity over time. It's also worth considering whether this kind of activity is normal for the system or if it's out of the ordinary.\n\nThe fact that some events are creating services and others are checking INF files makes me think there could be multiple stages here. Maybe the first event is attempting to install a service, which would be concerning, while the subsequent ones are trying to gather information about existing drivers. Both actions can be part of malicious activities like persistence or privilege escalation.\n\nAnother point I'm considering is the use of PowerShell with restricted execution policies. While this isn't inherently suspicious, it does limit script execution, so an attacker might use such commands to execute specific, potentially harmful scripts without being detected easily. The repeated calls to Write-Host could be a way to leave logs or communicate with other parts of a larger script.\n\nI'm also thinking about the file field being None in all these events. That means no files were accessed or modified during these processes. If the malicious activity involved writing or reading files, this would likely show up there, but since it's None, maybe they're just using in-memory commands or relying on existing files.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of creating a new service, checking for specific installation sections in INF files, and repeated PowerShell commands with restricted policies makes me lean towards classifying this batch as interesting. The variety of activities suggests potential malicious behavior rather than normal system operations. While some of these actions could be part of legitimate scripts or administrative tasks, the repetition and the nature of the commands increase the suspicion.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that this could be a test or a red team activity where attackers are trying to establish persistence or gather information before deploying more significant attacks. In any case, such behavior should be monitored closely, and appropriate measures taken to mitigate potential risks.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of events is classified as **interesting** from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Creation of a New Service:** The first event involves creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a specific binary path, which could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n2. **Repeated PowerShell Commands:** Multiple events execute PowerShell commands under restricted policies, possibly attempting to hide malicious activities or spread detection efforts.\n3. **Checking INF Files:** The regex pattern in the commands suggests an attempt to enumerate installed drivers, potentially for malicious purposes such as detecting known vulnerabilities or dropping malware components.\n4. **Repetition and Unusual Activity:** The repetition of similar commands across different tasks may indicate a script trying multiple actions, which is concerning when combined with restricted execution policies.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest potential malicious behavior, making the batch interesting for further investigation."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that the user has provided. Each line is a JSON object representing different system activities. My goal is to determine if this entire batch should be classified as \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING,\" along with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, let me go through each event one by one to understand what's happening.\n\nThe first two events have the same structure:\n- The process command line is running powershell.exe with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command inside is checking for specific .inf files in the Windows directory and looking for a particular pattern in their content. This seems like it could be related to detecting system changes or configurations.\n\nThe third event has no process information, but it's about \"Security Group Management\" in the Windows logs. That sounds pretty routine, maybe something related to group policy updates or user permissions.\n\nThe fourth event is from services.exe with a task of Logon. Services.exe is part of the standard Windows service control manager, so this is likely just a system process starting up or managing services during logon. Not unusual.\n\nThe fifth event again has no process info but mentions \"Special Logon.\" This could be related to system accounts logging on, which is normal as part of the system booting up or services starting.\n\nNow, putting all these together: The first two events are using PowerShell with a restricted policy, which might raise some flags because even though it's restricted, certain activities could indicate malicious behavior. However, in this case, the script seems to be checking for specific .inf files and patterns that relate to system installation or configuration, perhaps as part of a legitimate check.\n\nThe other events are about logon tasks and security group management, which are common and not indicative of anything suspicious on their own. But combined with the PowerShell activities, I need to assess if there's any pattern suggesting malicious behavior.\n\nI'm thinking that while each event might look benign individually, the combination could be a red flag. For instance, running a script that checks for specific system files and configurations alongside some logon events might suggest an attacker trying to validate system changes or prepare for further actions.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider whether this is just part of normal system operations. Restricted PowerShell commands are often used in legitimate scripts because they limit the permissions, which could be a good sign if it's part of a routine check. But without more context on what exactly these .inf files are being checked for, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as \"INTERESTING\" because there's an unusual script running alongside system logon and service activities, which could indicate potential malicious behavior or at least require further investigation. My confidence isn't super high, maybe around 0.6, since while the indicators are somewhat concerning, they might also be legitimate.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I think the batch is worth looking into but not a clear-cut case of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events include unusual PowerShell command-line activities with restricted execution policies checking system files, alongside logon and service management tasks, suggesting potential malicious behavior or investigation-worthy anomalies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
