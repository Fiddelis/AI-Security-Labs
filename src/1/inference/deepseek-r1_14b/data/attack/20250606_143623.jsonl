Let's go through them one by one and see what's happening.\n\nFirst event is powershell.exe accessing something, then whoami.exe running as a process create. Powershell again doing some access, then another access with a registry value set. Next, there's a command line in the powershell that looks suspicious: creating a service named \"objeto_ativo\" and pointing to a path with backslashes and spaces like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe\". That seems odd because it's a long path with unusual characters, possibly indicating a malicious script.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events from powershell, which is normal when scripts load modules. But after that, a file is created in the Temp folder named __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1, and immediately deleted. That's concerning because creating and deleting files quickly can be a tactic to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the services.exe events, multiple registry writes could mean they're trying to install or modify services, which is another red flag for potential malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell running scripts with suspicious command lines, creating\/deleting temp files, and services.exe modifying the registry.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of JSONL events and determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first 12 events, all of them are from 'svchost.exe' and involve registry value sets. Svchost is a common system process that hosts Windows services, so it's not unusual for it to interact with the registry. These could be normal operations. But seeing multiple instances might raise some flags, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, events 13 to 20 start appearing from 'setup.exe'. It looks like setup.exe is creating several files in the EdgeCore directory. The paths look legitimate—like for msedge.exe and other related executables. That's probably part of a software installation or update process. Setup.exe is commonly used during installations, so this seems normal.\n\nThere's also an event where RuntimeBroker.exe sets a registry value. RuntimeBroker is another system-related process, so that activity is standard as well.\n\nConsidering all these events together, the first 12 might be concerning if they're happening too frequently or at irregular intervals, but in isolation, without additional context, it's hard to say. However, the presence of setup.exe creating files for Microsoft Edge suggests a legitimate software operation, which would explain why there are multiple registry writes and file creations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity like access to unusual files, network connections, or unexpected process spawns. All activities point towards standard system operations, possibly an update or installation of Microsoft Edge components. So, the entire batch doesn't seem to indicate anything suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are related to normal system processes such as registry updates and file creations during software installations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of system log events. So, I've got 25 JSONL entries here, each representing an event. My task is to determine if this entire batch is interesting from a cybersecurity perspective or not.\n\nStarting off, the first few events are all related to 'svchost.exe' making changes to the registry. I know that svchost.exe is a common system process, often associated with services running under it. However, multiple registry writes in a short period might be suspicious because attackers sometimes use legitimate processes for malicious activities.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are either 'Registry value set' or 'Registry object added\/deleted'. These actions alone aren't necessarily bad, but when they happen frequently and involve different executables like 'services.exe' and 'setup.exe', it could indicate some activity worth monitoring. Especially since setup.exe is typically associated with software installations—why would it be making registry changes if there's nothing being installed?\n\nThen, towards the end of the logs, I see that 'setup.exe' starts creating files in various locations like 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application' and also creates shortcut files for Microsoft Edge. That seems a bit unusual because setup.exe shouldn't be modifying user profiles or creating start menu entries on its own unless it's actually installing something.\n\nThe last event shows the creation of a pipe, which could be related to inter-process communication. This might not be suspicious on its own but combined with other activities, it adds up.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple processes making frequent registry changes and file creations, especially in areas like 'Program Files' and user profiles, raises some red flags. It could indicate a potential installation of malicious software or legitimate software behaving abnormally. Given that there are several such events across different executables, this batch is definitely worth investigating further.\n\nSo, my classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with high confidence because the pattern suggests possible unauthorized changes or malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creations by different processes may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

I'm trying to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries where the process name is 'services.exe' and it's performing registry value sets. Services.exe is commonly associated with Windows services, so some activity here isn't unusual. However, repeated RegistryEvent tasks could indicate potential malicious activity like persistence mechanisms. But since these events alone don't show any suspicious behavior beyond standard operations, I'm not too concerned yet.\n\nNext, there are several entries for 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading various .NET framework components. This looks like a legitimate process interacting with necessary system libraries. No red flags here; it's just part of normal operation if this is an application that requires .NET support.\n\nThen, I see multiple events from 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell can be a double-edged sword—legitimate for administration but also often used in attacks. The FileCreate task could mean the creation of scripts or configurations, which might not be malicious on its own, but it's something to watch. However, without more context like file content analysis, I can't definitively say it's bad.\n\nLooking at 'MsMpEng.exe', that's related to Windows Defender, so Registry events here are normal as part of updates or configuration changes. Similarly, 'svchost.exe' is a common host process for various system services, and it often triggers registry activity without being malicious itself.\n\nThere's also an event where a file was created in the WindowsUpdate logs directory. This could be related to legitimate update processes, but sometimes attackers might manipulate these logs. Again, without more data on what was written there, it's hard to judge.\n\nConsidering all events together, while some activities could potentially be malicious, each individual action doesn't show clear signs of compromise. There are multiple instances that seem repetitive and within normal system operations. Without evidence of unusual combinations or deviations from baseline behavior, I'm leaning towards these being non-malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as services.exe, tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET components, PowerShell startup profile creation, and Windows Defender activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them involve powershell.exe processes. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used by attackers for command execution and lateral movement. The events show various tasks like Image loaded, File created, Process accessed, and Pipe Created. These types of activities can be part of normal operations, but in this context, they might indicate malicious behavior.\n\nOne event stands out: the process named 'whoami.exe' being executed. While whoami is generally benign, it's sometimes used by attackers to gather information about the system or user credentials. However, in this case, since it's standalone and not paired with other suspicious activities, I'm a bit uncertain if it's part of an attack chain.\n\nAnother thing I notice is multiple file creations under different paths like C:\\Windows\\Temp and C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell. This could be indicative of script execution or persistence mechanisms, which are common in malware to maintain access over time.\n\nAlso, the use of -ExecutionPolicy Restricted in a PowerShell command suggests that the attacker might be trying to limit detection by running scripts with restricted policies, but it's not foolproof. The command itself is fetching INI files and checking for specific patterns, which could be part of privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.\n\nConsidering all these points together, there are multiple red flags here, especially the combination of PowerShell activities, file creations in non-standard locations, and the use of potentially malicious scripts with restricted execution policies. While each individual event might not be alarming on its own, taken as a whole, they suggest a possible security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities including file creation in unusual paths and use of potentially malicious scripts with restricted execution policies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, I notice that most of them are related to 'setup.exe' performing tasks on the Windows Registry and creating pipes. Specifically, there are multiple entries where setup.exe sets registry values or creates pipes. This seems like normal behavior because setup.exe is commonly used for installing software, which would involve modifying the Registry and possibly using named pipes for communication between processes.\n\nThen, I see some events from 'svchost.exe'. SvcHost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts system services. The events here show file creations in the Windows Temp directory and another path related to AppReadiness. These activities are also typical since svchost.exe often creates or manages files when running services, especially during setup or updates.\n\nI'm looking for signs of anomalies or suspicious patterns. For instance, if there were a lot of failed login attempts, unusual file accesses, or processes running outside their normal cycles, that might raise flags. However, in this case, all the events seem to be standard operations associated with system setup and service hosting.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the frequency of these events. There are several entries from setup.exe making Registry changes and creating pipes, but without a baseline of what's normal for that specific system, it's hard to say if this volume is unusual. However, given that they're all part of typical processes, it doesn't seem concerning.\n\nAlso, none of the file paths look suspicious. The temporary files created by svchost.exe are in standard Windows directories like Temp and AppReadiness, which don't raise red flags. There's no indication of writing to unexpected locations or attempts to access sensitive areas beyond what's typical.\n\nI should also think about whether these events correlate with any known attack patterns. Since they're all legitimate system processes performing their usual tasks, I don't see a connection to common attack vectors like malware installation, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to monitor logs closely, the activities here don't show any signs of malicious behavior. They align with normal operations during software setup and service management.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of normal system processes such as registry modifications by 'setup.exe' and file creation by 'svchost.exe', which are typical activities during software installation or system updates.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I've got this batch of log events to analyze. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nThe first event shows powershell.exe being used. That's common for admins but can be a red flag because it's often associated with scripts or malicious activity. Then, there's an image loaded from the Windows Defender path. Hmm, defender files are usually legitimate, so maybe not suspicious here.\n\nNext, cmd.exe is running some commands to disable Windows Defender features and remove them without restarting. That seems odd because why would someone want to disable defender? Maybe trying to hide something or make the system less secure.\n\nThen another powershell.exe event with process access. Process access could mean privilege escalation or lateral movement. Not sure yet, but combined with the cmd activity, it's concerning.\n\nDism.exe is being executed in multiple events. The command line uses Dism with parameters to disable and remove Defender features. I know that Dism is a legitimate tool for servicing Windows images, but using it this way might be trying to bypass defender components or something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, there are several files created in a temp directory. These include various DLLs like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, etc. The naming looks generic, but creating multiple files in a temp folder could indicate that something is extracting or deploying additional tools or payloads.\n\nThe events show multiple instances where Dism.exe accesses and creates files. Each time, it's detected as an executable file, which might be normal if it's part of the system's operation, but combined with the other actions, it raises flags.\n\nPutting it all together: disabling defender features via cmd, using powershell for process access, and creating numerous temp files with Dism.exe could be signs of someone trying to remove or disable security features to hide their activities. The repeated use of these tools might indicate an attempt to persistence or modify the system's configuration in a way that's not typical user behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting because it combines several indicators that, while individually not too suspicious, together suggest possible malicious activity. The confidence is high because the actions align with common tactics like disabling security tools and using legitimate tools for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of potentially suspicious activities including the use of powershell.exe, cmd.exe to disable Windows Defender features, and Dism.exe creating numerous files in a temporary directory.

The repeated creation of DLLs might seem suspicious at first, but it's consistent with Dism.exe's functionality.\n\nOverall, while the volume is notable, there's no evidence of unusual access patterns or irregular activities that would suggest an attack.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I've been given a set of JSONL events, each representing different log entries from a system. My task is to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\". I need to provide only one classification with a justification and confidence score.\n\nFirst, let me look at the individual events:\n\n1. The first few logs are all from `svchost.exe` creating files in specific paths related to Windows AppReadiness and Edge Game Assist. These file creation events seem repetitive, occurring multiple times with similar or identical file paths.\n\n2. Then there are several entries where `svchost.exe` is setting registry values. Again, these are repeated multiple times, all under the same process name.\n\n3. Next, I see a process named `RuntimeBroker.exe` setting a registry value once.\n\n4. Towards the end, there's an event involving `powershell.exe`. It starts with a command that writes \"Final result: 1\" to the host, which is executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. After that, there are multiple ImageLoad events showing different DLLs being loaded by powershell.exe.\n\nNow, considering each of these steps:\n\n- The repeated file creation and registry modifications by `svchost.exe` could be suspicious because svchost.exe is often a legitimate process, but it's commonly associated with malware due to its role as a host for various services. However, in this case, the files are located under standard Windows directories (AppReadiness) which might indicate legitimate system operations.\n\n- The repeated actions by `svchost.exe` could be normal background activity, especially since these paths look related to system components or updates. But I should check if multiple identical file creations or registry writes within a short period are typical behavior.\n\n- The `RuntimeBroker.exe` event is less common. It's a legitimate Windows process used for managing runtime events and services, so a single registry write might not be concerning on its own unless it's part of an unusual pattern.\n\n- The `powershell.exe` execution catches my attention. Powershell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but also exploited by attackers. The command here writes to the host with a specific message. However, the ExecutionPolicy is set to Restricted, which limits script execution. The subsequent ImageLoad events show powershell loading various .NET and PowerShell-related DLLs, which is normal when running scripts or commands.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n\n1. `svchost.exe` activities: Multiple file creations in known system directories and registry writes. Since svchost can be a legitimate process, especially for services like Windows Update or Print Spooler, this might not be malicious on its own unless there are signs of deviation from normal behavior. But given the consistent paths, it's possibly benign.\n\n2. `powershell.exe` execution: The use of powershell with a specific command could be part of automated system tasks or legitimate user actions. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might indicate script execution loading necessary modules, which is standard. Since it's using \"Restricted\" ExecutionPolicy, it's less likely to execute malicious scripts but not impossible.\n\n3. Combining all events: The batch includes both svchost and powershell activities. If these were part of a coordinated attack, they might be indicators of malicious behavior. However, individually, each event could be normal system activity.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because none of the individual events clearly indicate malicious activity. The repetition by svchost.exe could be due to legitimate processes like service installations or updates. Powershell's usage here doesn't show signs of malicious scripts being executed; it's a restricted command that writes a simple message.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure. What if the repeated file creations are part of an attempt to write multiple files quickly as part of a persistence mechanism? Or could the powershell command be obfuscated in some way not captured here?\n\nBut looking at the provided data, there's no evidence of any deviation from standard process behaviors. The paths accessed by svchost.exe and the DLLs loaded by powershell are all within known system directories.\n\nThus, my conclusion is that this batch is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because each event on its own doesn't indicate malicious activity, and collectively, they appear to be normal system operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events consist of legitimate system processes such as file creations by svchost.exe in known Windows directories and registry modifications. Powershell execution with a restricted policy loads standard libraries, indicating no malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm given a batch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting or not for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to understand what's happening. All the events share the same process name: Dism.exe. That stands out because it suggests that all these actions are being performed by the same executable. I know that Dism.exe is related to the Deployment Image Service (DISM), which is used for managing system images and deployments in Windows.\n\nLooking at each event, most of them are File Delete logged events with a specific rule called FileDeleteDetected. The file paths all point to temporary directories under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp. Each path seems to reference different DLL files, some of which have \"Dism\" in their names, and others are language-specific MUI (Multi-User Interface) files in the en-US subdirectory.\n\nThere's also one event that stands out: it mentions a File creation time changed with the rule FileCreateTime. This might indicate that something is modifying the timestamps of these files, which could be an attempt to bypass logging or change file metadata.\n\nNow, considering all events together, the batch shows multiple deletions and a possible modification of file attributes by Dism.exe in a temporary directory. Since these actions are happening under the same process and involve deleting various files, including language-specific ones, it's worth investigating whether this activity is part of legitimate system operations or something malicious.\n\nDism.exe is a known legitimate tool used for servicing Windows images, but its activities can sometimes be associated with malware trying to clean up traces after an infection. The deletion of multiple files and the modification of creation times could suggest that an attacker is removing evidence or attempting to alter logs to mask their presence.\n\nOn the other hand, these actions might just be part of a legitimate update or cleanup process, especially since temporary files are often deleted after use. However, the combination of deletions across various file types and the change in file creation times raises concerns about potential malicious activity.\n\nGiven that all events come from Dism.exe and target specific temporary files, it's hard to conclusively determine without more context, but the pattern is notable enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe targeting various DLL and MUI files in a temporary directory suggest potential malicious activity or evidence tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me start by looking at each event and see what's going on.\n\nThe first 13 events all involve DismHost.exe loading various DLL files into memory. The file paths are all under a temporary folder with a long GUID-like name, which suggests it's some kind of isolated process or maybe part of an application setup. These entries are pretty standard for processes loading libraries, so nothing unusual there at first glance.\n\nThen, event 14 is the termination of DismHost.exe. That seems normal too—processes finish running and terminate. But then events 15 to 17 show Dism.exe deleting specific DLL files from that same temporary directory. This caught my attention because after a process loads these files, another process is explicitly deleting them.\n\nI know that Dism.exe is related to the DISM (Deployment Image Service Manager) tool, which is used for servicing Windows images. It's often involved in deploying updates and managing system components. However, the combination of loading multiple DLLs and then deleting them might be part of a normal setup or update process.\n\nBut wait, why delete those specific files? The fact that Dism.exe is deleting them after they were loaded by DismHost.exe makes me think—could this be part of some malicious activity? Maybe the initial loading was to execute code, and then deletion attempts could indicate an attempt to remove traces. Alternatively, it's possible that the deletions are just part of a cleanup process during normal operations.\n\nI'm considering the possibility of fileless malware, where malicious activities happen in memory without writing to disk. But in this case, there are file operations—loading and deleting DLLs—which might not fit the typical fileless model.\n\nAnother angle: The temporary directory path is quite long and unique, which might be a way to isolate files for specific tasks. I wonder if such directories are common in legitimate processes or if they're more often used by malicious actors to avoid detection.\n\nI should also think about the sequence of events. First, multiple DLLs are loaded, then the process terminates, and finally, another process deletes those DLLs. This could be part of a module's lifecycle where it loads necessary components and cleans up after itself, which is standard for some legitimate software.\n\nHowever, without more context on what these DLLs do or their origins, it's hard to say definitively. If the files are known malicious ones, that would raise flags, but if they're part of a legitimate update or deployment process, then it might just be normal behavior.\n\nI'm also recalling that some malware uses such techniques—loading modules into memory and then attempting to delete evidence from the disk. But again, this is speculative without further information on the files' nature.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some points worth noting—the use of a temporary directory with unique naming, the loading and subsequent deletion of multiple DLLs—it's not clear whether these events indicate malicious activity or if they're part of a legitimate process like system updates. Therefore, it might be INTERESTING but not conclusive without additional analysis.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DLL files are loaded by DismHost.exe and subsequently deleted by Dism.exe from a temporary directory.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether this batch of events is interesting or not. So, I've got a bunch of JSONL entries here, each with some event details. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, looking at the process name in all these events: they're all \"Dism.exe\". I remember that Dism is related to Windows Deployment Services. It's used for installing and configuring Windows, right? So, Dism is a legitimate system tool. That makes me think this activity is part of normal system operations.\n\nNow, each event has the same task in winlog: \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\". So, every single one of these events is about a file deletion being detected. But why are multiple files being deleted? Let's look at the file paths.\n\nThe path for each file starts with \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[some GUID]\\en-US\\[file name].dll.mui\". These all seem to be temporary files in a specific folder under the user's AppData directory. The filenames vary, but they're all .mui files related to different providers like IBSProvider, ImagingProvider, etc.\n\nWhy would Dism.exe delete these files? Well, during an OS deployment or setup process, Dism might extract and then clean up temporary files. Temporary directories are often deleted after a task is completed. So, it makes sense that Dism is deleting these files as part of its usual operation.\n\nI'm also thinking about the frequency here: there are 14 events all in a row, each deleting one of these .mui files. That seems like part of a batch process. If this happened during an actual deployment or setup, it's normal. But without more context, I can't be sure if this is happening outside of expected times.\n\nHowever, since Dism is a legitimate process and the activity matches its typical behavior (cleaning up temp files after deployment), there doesn't seem to be any malicious intent here. These events don't indicate anything unusual or suspicious. They're just part of how Windows handles temporary files during setup tasks.\n\nSo, putting it all together: same process, same task, deleting multiple but specific and expected temporary files under a known user's temp directory. No signs of unauthorized access or malware behavior. Therefore, this batch probably isn't interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe targeting temporary .mui files in a user's local directory are indicative of normal system cleanup during deployment or setup processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system log events is interesting or not. Let's start by looking at each event individually and then see if there's a pattern when considering all of them together.\n\nEach line in the JSONL file represents an event where 'Dism.exe' is the process name. The task logged is always \"File Delete\" under the rule FileDeleteDetected. The files being deleted are various DLLs located in a temporary directory path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by a specific GUID-like folder name.\n\nFirst, I recognize that Dism.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for deployment and servicing of Windows operating systems. It's commonly associated with tasks like installing updates, service packs, or performing system migrations. So, it's not unusual to see Dism.exe in system logs; however, the specific actions it's taking here could be concerning.\n\nLooking at each event, the files being deleted are all DLLs. The names of these DLLs vary but they include terms like Provider, SetupPlatformProvider, and others related to system setup and servicing. This suggests that Dism.exe is cleaning up temporary files after performing some operation. In normal scenarios, this could be part of a routine update or maintenance process.\n\nBut I need to consider the context of multiple similar events. If these deletions are happening one after another in quick succession, it might indicate that Dism.exe is running a script or process that deletes several files as part of its usual operation. Alternatively, if an attacker were using Dism.exe maliciously, they could be attempting to delete sensitive files or cover their tracks by removing logs or other artifacts.\n\nHowever, given that all the events are deletions of DLLs from a temporary directory, it seems more consistent with normal system behavior. Temporary directories are often used for holding files during installation or update processes, and once the process is done, these files are cleaned up. The fact that each event deletes a different DLL also supports this idea, as each might have been created during a specific phase of the servicing operation.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether the presence of Dism.exe performing multiple file deletions in such a way is typical. I know that Dism can be used for offline servicing, where it extracts files into a temporary directory and then applies updates or changes. After the servicing process completes, those temporary files are deleted. So, seeing multiple delete events from Dism.exe could simply be part of this cleanup phase.\n\nI also note that each file path is within the same temporary folder, which is generated with a unique GUID (the long string after Temp\\). This uniqueness suggests that these files were created during a single servicing operation and are now being removed together. If an attacker were involved, they might delete files from different locations or attempt to remove logs across multiple directories, but here it's contained within one.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm leaning towards low interest because all events point to normal system behavior. However, since there are 14 such events in a row, I should think about whether this is within the expected range for a typical servicing operation. Dism.exe might delete several files as part of its process, but if this number seems unusually high, it could warrant closer inspection.\n\nBut without additional context like timestamps or other logs indicating unusual activity before or after these deletions, it's hard to say definitively. For now, the information suggests routine cleanup by a legitimate system tool.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file deletion events by Dism.exe are consistent with normal system cleanup during servicing operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this. So, I'm given a batch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event one by one.\n\nThe first two events have the same command line: they're running PowerShell with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The command seems to be checking for certain patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. Specifically, it's looking for lines that match a regex pattern related to defaultinstall.nt architectures. This looks like it could be part of some system configuration or maybe even malware trying to check for specific drivers or components.\n\nThe third event doesn't have any process information; it's about Security Group Management. That seems routine and probably not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe fourth event is services.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process related to managing services. The logon task here might be normal user activity, so nothing unusual there.\n\nThe fifth event again mentions Special Logon without any associated process, which could be part of the system's regular operations, like a service starting under a different context.\n\nPutting it all together: the first two PowerShell commands caught my attention because they're accessing sensitive files (INF in Windows directory) and using regex to look for specific patterns. This could indicate either legitimate admin activity or potentially malicious behavior trying to identify certain drivers to exploit. The other events are more routine, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it raises some flags.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because the use of restricted PowerShell to inspect INF files is not a common activity and could indicate reconnaissance or preparation for an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Two events show unusual PowerShell commands accessing system files, potentially indicating malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this log data that someone has provided. It's a series of JSON objects, each containing information about processes, Windows logs, and files. My task is to analyze this data and determine if there are any security concerns or suspicious activities.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the data. Each entry seems to have three main parts: \"process\", \"winlog\", and \"file\". The \"process\" field sometimes has a name like 'services.exe' or 'svchost.exe', which are common system processes. Other times it's null or shows commands executed via PowerShell.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see processes like 'services.exe' and 'sppsvc.exe'. These are typical for Windows services, so nothing unusual there. The file paths seem normal too, pointing to system directories.\n\nThen, I notice an entry where \"process\" is null, but \"winlog\" mentions \"Windows Update Agent\". That's a legitimate process by Microsoft for handling updates, so that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nThe next entries are all null except for some repeated PowerShell commands. The command line in the \"process\" field creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\". This caught my attention because it's using PowerShell to create and start a service, which is a common technique for both legitimate administration and potential malicious activities.\n\nI'm concerned about the path structure. The backslashes are in Portuguese (\"\\\\\") which might not be standard on all systems, but that alone isn't suspicious. However, if this script is being executed by an unauthorized user or without proper permissions, it could indicate a breach. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" translates to \"active object\", which is generic and doesn't immediately signal anything malicious.\n\nThe fact that multiple entries show the same PowerShell command suggests that this might be part of a script running multiple times, possibly trying different things or in a loop. This could be for legitimate purposes like automated tasks, but it could also be an attempt to establish persistence on the system, allowing attackers to maintain access even after reboots.\n\nI should check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is a known malicious file. Without analyzing its content, I can't say for sure. It's possible that this is part of a legitimate application or a custom script meant to run scheduled tasks. However, the way it's being executed via PowerShell and created as a service could be indicators of an attack.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether these activities are happening outside normal business hours or without proper authorization. If these logs were captured during unexpected times, that adds another layer of concern.\n\nIn summary, while some entries are normal system processes, the repeated use of PowerShell to create services and execute files from potentially unknown paths raises security concerns. It would be wise to investigate the origin of these scripts and verify if they're authorized. Additionally, monitoring for any unusual behavior from the service named \"objeto_ativo\" could help detect potential threats.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log data contains multiple entries indicating suspicious activities that could pose a security risk:\n\n1. **Repetitive PowerShell Execution**: The repeated execution of PowerShell commands to create and start a service named \"objeto_ativo\" is concerning. This suggests unauthorized access or an attempt at establishing persistence on the system.\n\n2. **Potentially Malicious File Path**: The path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\" could be malicious, especially if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" isn't recognized as a legitimate file.\n\n3. **Lack of Authorization**: There's no indication that these activities were authorized, which raises the possibility of a cyberattack or unauthorized system access.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Conduct an investigation to determine the origin and purpose of the PowerShell scripts.\n- Check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" is associated with known malware.\n- Monitor the service \"objeto_ativo\" for any suspicious behavior.\n- Ensure all activities are authorized and within normal operational procedures."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a batch of system log events in JSONL format to analyze. My job is to determine whether this entire batch is interesting or not from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each event individually and then see if there's any pattern or combination that stands out. Each line represents an event with three main components: process information, Windows log task, and file details.\n\nLooking at the first event:\n- **Process:** The command line is running a PowerShell script that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" pointing to an executable path. It also starts this service.\n- **Windows Log Task:** This one is under 'Engine Lifecycle', which usually relates to the creation or deletion of services, so that makes sense here.\n\nThe next seven events all have similar structures:\n- **Process Command Line:** They're running PowerShell with ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted and executing a Write-Host command to output \"Final result: 1\". The task is 'Provider Lifecycle' for most, except one which is under 'Engine Lifecycle'.\n- **File Details:** All of these don't mention any file interactions.\n\nNow, analyzing this:\n\n1. **PowerShell Execution with Elevated Privileges:**\n   - Using PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` suggests the user wants to execute scripts but restricts script execution in general. However, in some cases, this can be a red flag because it's often used by attackers to bypass certain security measures.\n\n2. **Repeating Commands:**\n   - The fact that multiple events (seven) are running almost identical commands, each time checking for specific patterns in INF files, is concerning. Repetitive and similar actions could indicate script testing or part of a larger malicious payload being deployed across different systems.\n\n3. **Service Creation:**\n   - Creating a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starting it might be an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Malware often creates services to ensure it starts at boot without user interaction.\n\n4. **Script Content Analysis:**\n   - The scripts are checking for patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. Specifically, looking for sections like `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` could indicate attempts to identify or modify system drivers or components, which is a common tactic in more advanced attacks.\n\n5. **No File Access:**\n   - The absence of file details (file: None) might mean that the scripts aren't writing or reading files beyond what's necessary for their operations. However, considering they are checking INF files, it could still be malicious without directly modifying them.\n\n6. **Combination of Events:**\n   - The batch starts with creating a service and then proceeds to run multiple checks on system files. This sequence can be part of an attack chain where initial access is gained, followed by lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nPotential Concerns:\n- The combination of service creation and repeated script executions could indicate that this is part of a larger campaign.\n- The scripts running with Elevated privileges might be attempting to perform actions they shouldn't have access to, especially since Restricted ExecutionPolicy might limit their capabilities but not necessarily prevent all malicious activities.\n- The repeated checks on system INF files suggest an attempt to understand the system's configuration or possibly look for vulnerabilities.\n\nConfidence Level:\nI'm about 80% confident because while each event individually isn't overtly malicious (they're just scripts), the repetition and specific actions taken together raise red flags. It's possible that these are legitimate scripts, but given the nature of the commands and the combination, it's more likely they're part of an attack.\n\nFinal Classification:\nBased on the analysis, this batch seems to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions with Elevated privileges, repeated attempts to check system INF files, and creation of a new service suggest potential malicious activity or unauthorized access.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
