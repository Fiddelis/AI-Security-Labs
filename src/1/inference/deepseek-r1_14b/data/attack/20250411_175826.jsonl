{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this batch of log events is interesting or not. So, I'm looking at a bunch of JSONL entries here. Each line represents an event with some process info, Windows log task details, and sometimes a file path.\n\nFirst off, most of these events are from 'chrome.exe'. There are multiple instances where chrome.exe is making network connections and querying DNS. That's normal because Chrome does a lot of networking as part of its operation—browsing the web, fetching data, etc. So on its own, that doesn't seem suspicious.\n\nThen there are several entries involving 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is commonly used for system administration tasks but can also be abused for malicious purposes. The events show things like process creation, accessing processes, modifying registry values, and file operations. For example, there's a script being executed that changes the last write time of files to \"01\/01\/1970 00:00:00\". That date is a common Unix epoch reference, often used in file tampering to make files appear older or newer than they are. This could be an attempt to bypass certain security checks.\n\nAlso, there's a file being created and then deleted almost immediately. The creation of __PSScriptPolicyTest_womzixlw.p4d.ps1 suggests it's part of PowerShell script testing or policy checks. But the quick delete might indicate an attempt to avoid detection or clean up traces after execution.\n\nLooking at other processes, there are instances where 'whoami.exe' is run, which could be used to gather user information. Additionally, RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe are also involved in registry modifications, which could be legitimate but sometimes attackers use common tools for malicious activities.\n\nThe events involving image loading of various DLLs by PowerShell might indicate script execution or loading modules. While this isn't inherently suspicious, combined with the other actions like file manipulation and registry changes, it raises some flags.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of Powershell executing scripts that alter file timestamps and delete temporary files could be signs of malicious activity trying to cover their tracks. The combination of these events across different processes suggests potential compromise or unauthorized access.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple PowerShell activities, including script execution, file manipulation, and registry modifications, which may indicate malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are several events where powershell.exe is being used with command lines that modify file timestamps. The commands like Get-ChildItem and setting LastWriteTime to \"01\/01\/1970\" stand out because changing file times can be a sign of tampering or an attempt to hide activity. I've seen similar tactics in malware where files are modified to look older or newer than they actually are, possibly to avoid detection.\n\nNext, there's an event where calc.exe loads urlmon.dll. That seems a bit off because Calculator usually doesn't interact with URL-related DLLs. Maybe it's part of some test code or malicious activity trying to load known bad modules.\n\nThen I see multiple instances of svchost.exe and conhost.exe making registry changes. Svchost is a common system process, but unusual registry modifications can be red flags, especially if they're happening frequently. Conhost being involved might indicate command line processing that could be part of malicious scripts.\n\nThere's also an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the user's Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is typically used for log management, so creating files there isn't inherently bad, but it depends on the context. If this process is running with elevated privileges or accessing unexpected areas, it might warrant closer look.\n\nLooking further, ApplicationFrameHost and Calculator again are involved in registry changes. These processes being active and making such modifications could be part of legitimate operations, but considering the other events, it's worth monitoring.\n\nI notice multiple chrome.exe entries modifying the registry. While Chrome does make registry changes during updates or extensions installation, so many entries might indicate something else, like a script trying to inject components or malicious activity attempting persistence.\n\nPutting this all together: unusual file timestamp modifications with powershell, unexpected DLL loads in calc.exe, frequent registry changes by svchost and conhost, and multiple chrome events. These could be signs of potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, data tampering, or test code injection. The repeated use of powershell for file manipulation is particularly concerning because it's a common tool for attackers.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if some of these actions are part of normal user behavior, especially in an environment where users might run scripts or have multiple processes running. Without more context, like the exact timestamps and sequences, it's hard to say definitively. But the combination does raise flags that suggest further investigation is needed.\n<\/think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe batch of system logs exhibits several concerning activities that merit closer examination for potential malicious behavior:\n\n1. **Powershell Activities**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` modifying file timestamps using commands like `Get-ChildItem` and setting `LastWriteTime`. These actions can indicate tampering or attempts to obscure activity, commonly seen in malware.\n\n2. **Unexpected DLL Loads**: `calc.exe` loading `urlmon.dll`, which is unusual for a process typically unrelated to URL handling, suggesting potential test code or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Registry Modifications**: Frequent registry changes by processes like `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While svchost is legitimate, such modifications can be suspicious, especially in volume, possibly indicating persistence mechanisms.\n\n4. **Winlogbeat Activity**: Creation of files by `winlogbeat.exe`, typically used for log management, which might warrant monitoring if accessing unexpected areas or running with elevated privileges.\n\n5. **Chrome Events**: Numerous registry changes by `chrome.exe`. While Chrome does make such modifications, the frequency suggests potential script injection or malicious persistence.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of these activities—especially the powershell file manipulations and unusual process interactions—raises significant security concerns. Further investigation is recommended to assess the nature of these processes and their impact on system integrity."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175826.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's take a look at this batch of events to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. First off, I notice that there are multiple entries related to the chrome.exe process setting registry values and loading system files like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These actions aren't unusual on their own since legitimate software often interacts with the registry and loads DLLs.\n\nHowever, what stands out is the frequency of these events. Chrome repeatedly setting registry values could be a red flag if it's outside normal usage patterns. Additionally, there are file creation events from powershell.exe creating a .txt file named unidade_logico.txt. Powershell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so this could warrant closer inspection.\n\nI should also consider the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating its configuration file. While this is standard for log management tools, the combination with other events might hint at potential log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.\n\nTaking all these points into account, the batch does have some elements that merit attention but aren't definitive enough to classify as malicious on their own. Therefore, it's somewhat interesting but not a clear sign of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation activities by powershell.exe, which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}\n```"}
