{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to figure out if there's anything interesting that might indicate malicious activity. Let's go through each event one by one and see what stands out.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events involving PowerShell.exe being accessed multiple times. That in itself isn't necessarily suspicious because PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks. However, the frequency here is quite highâ€”like several entries within a short period. I should keep that in mind as it might indicate something more if combined with other factors.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe and cmd.exe being executed. These are standard utilities, so they're often part of normal system operations or user activities. But when paired with command-line arguments, especially ones that create new processes or modify the registry, it could be a red flag. Looking closer, I see commands like creating services using sc.exe. That's interesting because creating a service can be a way to persist malicious activity across reboots.\n\nThe events show multiple instances of Registry value sets from various processes, including cmd.exe, services.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, svchost.exe, and others. The registry is often targeted by malware for persistence or configuration changes. The fact that so many different processes are modifying the registry could indicate a broader malicious campaign trying to hide its tracks or create multiple points of persistence.\n\nLooking at the command lines, especially in the cmd.exe events, I see attempts to execute scripts like NonExistingScript.ps1 and componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1. The fact that these script paths don't exist suggests either an error or deliberate obfuscation. Malware often uses non-existent files to avoid detection or as part of a payload delivery mechanism.\n\nAnother point is the use of sc.exe to create and query services (win32times). Creating new services can be a way for attackers to maintain persistence on a system, allowing them to start their malicious processes at boot or through other triggers. The repeated attempts to modify the registry further support this idea of establishing persistence.\n\nThere are also entries from RuntimeBroker.exe, which is known to sometimes be involved in malicious activities as it's part of Windows' application management but can be exploited. Similarly, svchost.exe is a common target for malware because it's a legitimate process that can execute arbitrary code when configured improperly or exploited.\n\nThe final events involve Calculator.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll, which is a standard DLL used by URLMON in Windows. This isn't particularly suspicious on its own unless there are other indicators pointing to malicious behavior elsewhere.\n\nPutting this all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell accesses, creation of new services via sc.exe, repeated registry modifications across various processes, and attempts to execute non-existent scripts suggests a coordinated effort that could be indicative of malware attempting persistence or lateral movement. The variety of process names involved and the nature of their actions make this batch stand out as potentially malicious.\n\nWhile some individual events might look benign, the aggregate shows a pattern of activity consistent with attack behaviors, such as creating persistent backdoors, obfuscating command lines, and manipulating system configurations. This makes me confident that the batch is indeed interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of PowerShell.exe accesses, creation of new services using sc.exe, repeated registry modifications, and attempts to execute non-existent scripts suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events and trying to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a variety of processes involved. There's winlogbeat.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe multiple times, and chrome.exe many times. Each event has some task associated with it like file creation, registry changes, pipe events, image loading, etc.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new in the user's directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is likely setting up its configuration or data files. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nNext, ApplicationFrameHost.exe and Calculator.exe both set registry values. These are common system processes; I don't see anything wrong here immediately.\n\nThen there are multiple entries from powershell.exe accessing processes and making registry changes. PowerShell is often used for legitimate admin tasks but can also be abused by attackers. The fact that it's accessing other processes might raise an eyebrow, but on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nNow, looking at chrome.exe: There are several events where it creates a pipe and accesses the registry multiple times. Additionally, it loads two different system DLLs: amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate Windows components used for anti-malware scanning interface and Defender's platform respectively. So that seems normal.\n\nBut considering all these together, especially the number of events from chrome.exe, could there be something amiss? Maybe it's just regular activity, but I'm wondering if multiple registry accesses in a short time might indicate something more.\n\nOn the other hand, nothing here stands out as overtly malicious. The processes involved are standard ones performing typical actions. There's no evidence of known malicious file creations or unusual network activities mentioned.\n\nSo, while some individual events could be points of interest, collectively they don't form a clear pattern of malicious behavior. They seem to align with normal system operations and legitimate application behaviors.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to consist of normal system activities such as process creation, registry modifications, and file operations by common applications like chrome.exe and powershell.exe. There are no signs of overtly malicious behavior or unusual patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
