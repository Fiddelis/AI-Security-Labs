{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether this batch of log events is interesting or not for investigation. Let's go through each event and see what they're indicating.\n\nFirst, looking at the events:\n\n1. **Powershell.exe** accessing something. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers because it has scripting capabilities. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times could be suspicious.\n2. **Whoami.exe** being executed. That's usually just a simple command to check user information, not inherently malicious, but when combined with other events, might raise an eyebrow.\n3. Multiple instances of **cmd.exe** creating services with commands that execute PowerShell scripts. The script names have \"NonExistingScript.ps1\", which seems like a red flag because if the script doesn't exist, maybe they're trying to hide something or it's a typo for malicious code.\n4. There are several Registry value sets by various processes including **services.exe**, **sc.exe**, and others. Modifying the registry is common for persistence mechanisms in malware.\n5. **RuntimeBroker.exe** making changes—this process is legitimate, but unusual activity here could indicate tampering.\n6. **Calculator.exe** loading urlmon.dll, which seems odd because Calculator typically doesn't need that DLL, which is related to URL handling and might be used by malicious scripts.\n7. A file creation event by **winlogbeat.exe**, which is likely a log shipping tool; this might not be suspicious on its own unless there's an unusual pattern here.\n\nPutting it all together: There are multiple signs of potential malicious activity. PowerShell being accessed, cmd creating services with hidden script paths, registry modifications that could indicate persistence, and Calculator loading unexpected DLLs—all these points add up to a batch that seems concerning. The confidence is high because several red flags are present across different processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of suspicious activities such as PowerShell accesses, creation of services via cmd.exe with non-existent scripts, registry modifications, and Calculator loading unexpected DLLs indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm given a bunch of system log events in JSONL format and need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one to spot any patterns or unusual activities.\n\n1. The first few entries show processes like powershell.exe being accessed or created. Powershell is often used by attackers because it's powerful, but on its own, accessing it isn't suspicious unless there are other signs.\n2. There's an entry where a file path includes \"winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\". Winlogbeat is part of the Elastic Stack for log management. Seeing this might just be normal if someone is running logs, but I should check if it's being used correctly.\n3. There are multiple entries where svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are accessing registry values. These are common system processes, so unless they're doing something out of the ordinary, it might not be a red flag.\n4. Some entries mention \"urlmon.dll\" being loaded by Calculator.exe and calc.exe. That's odd because I don't expect Calculator to load URL-related modules. Maybe this is a sign of some malicious activity or maybe just a legitimate process with unexpected behavior.\n5. Towards the end, there are several chrome.exe processes accessing registry values and loading modules like \"amsi.dll\" which is related to anti-malware scanning. This could be normal, but multiple instances might raise an eyebrow.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the high frequency of Registry value accesses by various processes, especially non-standard ones like Calculator.exe, could indicate that something is trying to modify system configurations or hide itself. The repeated use of powershell.exe without obvious legitimate use also makes me cautious.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of winlogbeat might be part of a monitoring setup, but if it's creating unnecessary files or accessing restricted areas, it could be suspicious. The use of chrome.exe multiple times accessing registry values is another point to consider—if this isn't related to browser extensions or plugins, it might be malicious.\n\nI should also note that while some activities can be legitimate (like system processes running normally), the combination and frequency here seem off. It's possible that an attacker is using these processes to execute commands, hide files, or establish persistence on the system.\n\nIn summary, there are several red flags: unusual file accesses by standard apps like Calculator.exe, high registry activity across multiple processes, and repeated powershell.exe usage. These points together make me think this batch of logs could indicate malicious activities worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Processes Accessing Registry Values:**\n   - Multiple entries show processes accessing or modifying registry values. This includes svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and chrome.exe. While these are legitimate system processes, frequent access can indicate malicious activity.\n\n2. **Note Powershell Usage:**\n   - powershell.exe is accessed multiple times. Attackers often use PowerShell for executing commands or scripts, making this a potential red flag.\n\n3. **Examine Non-Standard File Loads:**\n   - Calculator.exe loads urlmon.dll, which is unusual. This module is typically related to URL handling, and its presence in such a process could signal an attempt to inject code or execute unauthorized actions.\n\n4. **Check for Monitoring Tools:**\n   - The presence of winlogbeat.exe might be part of log management. If unexpected, it could indicate unauthorized logging activities or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **Assess Browser Activity:**\n   - chrome.exe accesses registry values multiple times and loads modules like amsi.dll. While some browser activity is normal, excessive access could suggest malicious extensions or scripts.\n\n6. **Combine Observations for Context:**\n   - The combination of unusual file accesses, high registry activity, and suspicious process behavior points towards potential malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms, data theft, or system compromise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe logs exhibit several indicators of possible malicious activity, including suspicious process behaviors and unusual file accesses. These signs collectively suggest that the batch is indeed worth investigating further to determine if a security incident has occurred."}
