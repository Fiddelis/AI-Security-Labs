{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one and see what's going on.\n\nFirst off, most of these events are from powershell.exe processes. That catches my attention because PowerShell is a powerful tool often used both for legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The command lines look suspicious too. They all have similar structures with New-ScheduledTaskAction, which creates scheduled tasks. The actions are set to execute calc.exe, but why would they schedule that at logon?\n\nLooking closer, the scheduled tasks are being registered under different names like 'unidade_ativo' and others. That seems odd because it's using a lot of varied task names, maybe trying to avoid detection or persistence. Also, the user specified is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, meaning this task has high privileges. That’s a red flag because malware often uses high privileges to maintain access.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that some events are about registry value changes (RegistryEvent) and process accesses (ProcessAccess). These activities could be part of creating or modifying scheduled tasks, which aligns with the other logs. The fact that these actions are happening multiple times might indicate an attempt to set up persistent malware across reboots.\n\nThere's also an event where chrome.exe creates a pipe and modifies registry entries. While Chrome can do legitimate things like this, the combination of seeing both chrome.exe and powershell.exe doing unusual things might be worth looking into for possible lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, there are ImageLoad events from powershell.exe loading mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. Those are .NET-related DLLs, which are normal for PowerShell scripts since they often use .NET libraries. But combined with the other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern that something malicious is happening.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple scheduled tasks being created by powershell.exe with high privileges, executing calc.exe at logon, varied task names possibly to evade detection, and registry modifications. These patterns are consistent with malware or a persistence mechanism trying to maintain access on the system. The confidence level here is pretty high because several indicators point towards potential malicious activity rather than normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell processes creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action, targeting high privileges and logon trigger.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at the provided JSONL events to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries where powershell.exe is loading various .NET and Defender-related DLLs. That's not unusual on its own since PowerShell often interacts with these system files. However, there are also file creation and deletion events related to a script test in the user's Temp directory. This could be part of a legitimate check or something more nefarious, like testing script execution policies.\n\nThen, there's a command line event in powershell.exe that creates a scheduled task to run calc.exe on logon. That catches my attention because using PowerShell to create scheduled tasks is common in both legitimate and malicious activities. The use of BUILTIN\\Administrators group with highest privileges might be a red flag since attackers often escalate privileges this way.\n\nAdditionally, there are several registry writes by chrome.exe. While Chrome does modify the registry for updates or settings, multiple events without a clear purpose could indicate something suspicious, especially if combined with other activities.\n\nLastly, there are multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events from None process. This is concerning because it suggests unauthorized remote activity that's being logged but might be difficult to trace. Such events often point towards potential command-and-control communication or malicious scripts running without proper attribution.\n\nPutting it all together: powershell.exe creating a scheduled task with calc.exe, privilege escalation attempts, and unknown remote commands strongly suggest possible malicious behavior. The combination of these activities makes the batch worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity including Powershell command execution creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe with admin privileges, and repeated remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this batch of log events. There are a lot of entries here, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the initial logs have 'Execute a Remote Command' in the winlog task. That seems suspicious because executing remote commands can be a sign of malicious activity, like remote code execution or command-line attacks. But looking closer, these entries don't have any associated process or file information—so it's hard to tell if they're part of normal operations or actual threats.\n\nThen, there are some events involving 'powershell.exe' with specific commands. One line shows a PowerShell script that creates a scheduled task using 'New-ScheduledTaskAction', which executes calc.exe at logon. This is concerning because creating scheduled tasks can be used for persistence by attackers. The command-line argument here seems malicious, especially since it's targeting the Administrators group and running with highest privileges.\n\nThere are multiple instances of svchost.exe accessing the registry and files, which is unusual because svchost is typically a legitimate process but can also be abused by malware to hide activities. The file creation event for 'unidade_comum' in Task Scheduler could indicate an attempt to create a malicious task that runs at logon.\n\nAnother red flag is the use of conhost.exe and chrome.exe making registry changes, which isn't typical behavior for these processes. Additionally, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a configuration file, but I don't see anything obviously suspicious about that on first glance.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple signs of potential malicious activities: remote command execution attempts, scheduled task creation with elevated privileges, and unusual process behaviors. These collectively suggest a high likelihood of an attack or compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious events including remote command executions, registry modifications by svchost.exe, and the creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges using powershell.exe. These activities could indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, most of them are from chrome.exe with a task labeled as 'Registry value set'. Since Chrome is a common browser, these registry changes might be normal updates or settings adjustments. I don't see any immediate red flags here because it's not unusual for applications to modify the registry when they run.\n\nThen there's an event where winlogbeat.exe creates a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is likely part of an ELK stack setup, used for log management. It's normal for this process to create or update configuration files, so that doesn't seem suspicious on its own.\n\nThe next event is powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is commonly used by both legitimate scripts and attackers, so this could be concerning. However, without more context—like what the script does after creation—it's hard to say definitively. But in isolation, just creating a text file isn't enough to raise an alarm.\n\nConsidering all events together, there are multiple instances of chrome.exe making registry changes, which seems repetitive and possibly normal. The winlogbeat event is benign, and the powershell event could be either legitimate or malicious but doesn't have enough context provided to classify it as suspicious without further information.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"NOT INTERESTING\" because individually these events are common, and collectively they don't present a clear pattern of malicious activity. My confidence is about 0.8 because while there's potential for concern with the powershell.exe event, there's not enough evidence to support an investigation without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events are largely normal system activities, including Chrome registry modifications and legitimate file operations by winlogbeat and PowerShell.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}\n```"}
