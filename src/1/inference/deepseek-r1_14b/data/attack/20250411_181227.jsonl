{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Each line is a JSON object representing an event.\n\nFirst, most events involve powershell.exe with command lines that create scheduled tasks. These tasks execute calc.exe on login, run as administrators with highest privileges. This seems suspicious because creating multiple scheduled tasks can be a tactic in persistence or malicious activity.\n\nAlso, the varying task names like \"unidade_ativo\" and \"tarefa_base\" don't seem standard. The repeated use of powershell.exe to create these tasks increases my concern. Such behavior is often seen in attacks where attackers set up long-term access points.\n\nThere are also events where powershell.exe accesses processes and modifies the registry, which could be part of setting up these tasks or for other malicious purposes. Additionally, some logs show image loads related to .NET frameworks, which might be normal, but combined with the other activities, they add to the suspicion.\n\nThe last few entries about chrome.exe creating pipes and modifying the registry seem less concerning on their own, but when considering the overall pattern of powershell activity, it's worth noting. However, they don't contribute as much to the malicious behavior indicators as the powershell tasks do.\n\nIn summary, the repeated creation of scheduled tasks by powershell.exe with elevated privileges is a strong indicator that this batch should be investigated further.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks to execute calc.exe at logon as administrators, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let's go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, the events are in JSONL format, with each line containing one JSON object. Each object has three keys: process, winlog, and file. The process key usually contains information about the executable that was run, such as its name or command-line arguments. The winlog key indicates a Windows log event, often related to security tasks like file operations or registry changes. The file key provides details about any files involved in these events.\n\nLooking at the first few events:\n\n1. powershell.exe is loading MpOAV.dll from a Windows Defender directory. That seems normal since PowerShell loads various DLLs as part of its operation and Defender's components are legitimate.\n2. powershell.exe creates a temporary file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1 in the user's AppData folder. This is suspicious because it's a script file, and creating temp files can be a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection. However, sometimes legitimate scripts also do this.\n3. powershell.exe deletes that same temporary file immediately after creation. The fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might raise an eyebrow—malware often cleans up traces of its activities.\n\nMoving on:\n\n4. Another event shows a pipe being created by powershell.exe. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but in the context of PowerShell, they could be part of malicious command chaining or for hiding processes.\n5. The next event is quite telling: powershell.exe executing a script that creates a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon with highest privileges under the Administrators group. This is concerning because using scheduled tasks to execute commands, especially with elevated rights, can indicate persistence mechanisms. Furthermore, using calc.exe as an example seems like it's either testing or trying to hide malicious activity (since calc is a benign application).\n\nFollowing that, there are multiple events from chrome.exe modifying the registry. While Chrome does make changes to the Windows registry for things like extensions and settings, multiple registry writes in quick succession could be suspicious if they're not accounted for by known updates or user actions.\n\nThen there's a series of events with 'Execute a Remote Command' without any process or file information. These are vague but could indicate an attempt to execute commands over the network, which is a common attack vector. Without context, it's hard to say, but these should definitely be monitored.\n\nThe last event repeats the powershell.exe command from earlier, further reinforcing the idea that this script might be attempting persistence by registering multiple scheduled tasks with different names (unidade_comum), possibly trying to avoid detection or ensure execution even if one is removed.\n\nPutting it all together, the consistent use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks for executing commands with high privileges and the temporary file creation\/deletion pattern suggests potential malicious activity. Additionally, the remote command executions add another layer of concern as they might be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nTherefore, this batch of logs does seem interesting from a cybersecurity standpoint because several red flags are present—like suspicious script execution, file manipulation, and privilege escalation via scheduled tasks. These activities could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or carry out malicious operations on the system.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided system logs reveals several concerning patterns indicative of potential malicious activity:\n\n1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities**:\n   - Creation and deletion of temporary script files (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1`) by `powershell.exe`. This behavior can be a red flag, as malware often creates and deletes such files to avoid detection.\n   - Use of `powershell.exe` to create scheduled tasks that execute `calc.exe` at logon with elevated privileges. The repeated registration of different task names (`unidade_comum`) suggests an attempt to establish persistence and evade detection.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple registry writes by `chrome.exe`. While legitimate, this could be suspicious if unexplained by known updates or user actions.\n\n3. **Remote Command Execution**:\n   - Events indicating 'Execute a Remote Command' without detailed process or file information. Such events are concerning as they might signal an attack vector for remote execution of malicious code.\n\nIn conclusion, the logs exhibit multiple indicators consistent with potential cybersecurity threats, including signs of persistence mechanisms and possible privilege escalation. These findings underscore the need for further investigation to determine if these activities are indeed malicious in nature."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether this batch of logs is interesting or not. So, I'm given a bunch of JSONL events, each with process information, winlog tasks, and file paths.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes: there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which I know is related to Windows Management Instrumentation and can be used by malware for persistence. Then there are multiple instances of svchost.exe doing registry changes, which could be suspicious because svchost is a common process but often used by malicious actors.\n\nI also see powershell.exe creating files, like StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. PowerShell is a powerful tool that's frequently abused in attacks, so any unusual activity here should be flagged. There's also the creation of entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt by powershell.exe—those file names are Spanish for \"main object\" and \"auxiliary object,\" which might not mean much on their own but could be part of malicious scripts.\n\nConhost.exe is another one to look at; it's often used in command-line attacks. Then there's a lot of registry activity from chrome.exe, which seems odd because Chrome shouldn't be making so many registry changes. Also, the file paths like taskschd.dll and MpOAV.dll don't immediately ring alarms, but when combined with other suspicious activities, they add up.\n\nThe repeated RegistryEvent tasks in svchost and chrome are concerning. Malware often uses registry modifications to maintain persistence or drop files. Additionally, WmiPrvSE.exe is known for being used in certain types of attacks, so its presence here adds another layer.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a mix of processes doing things that could be part of normal operations but also show signs of potential malicious activity. The use of powershell.exe creating files and the high number of registry changes from unexpected processes like chrome.exe make this batch stand out as potentially indicative of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains multiple suspicious activities such as WmiPrvSE.exe process, powershell.exe creating files, and numerous registry modifications by svchost.exe and chrome.exe. These indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
