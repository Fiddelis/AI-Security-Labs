{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event one by one and see what's going on.\n\nThe first few lines show powershell.exe being executed with a command line that creates scheduled tasks. Each time, it's using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe at logon, with administrative privileges. That's a bit concerning because creating multiple scheduled tasks could be part of persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nThen there are events where the task is 'Provider Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but combined with the powershell activity, it might indicate some kind of service or task registration.\n\nNext, there are entries where powershell.exe is accessed in the registry. Registry modifications can be a sign of malicious activity, especially when setting values related to scheduled tasks or services.\n\nOne event shows chrome.exe creating a pipe and modifying the registry. While chrome can do that for its plugins or extensions, multiple instances doing this might be suspicious, but in this case, it's only once so maybe not too bad.\n\nThe last few events are about images being loaded by powershell.exe, specifically mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are part of the .NET framework, so that's expected when running powershell scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of powershell creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe as the action. That seems like a clear attempt to maintain persistence on the system. The use of administrative privileges (RunLevel Highest) and targeting logon events makes me think this is part of an attack chain. Even though there are other processes like chrome accessing the registry, the repeated powershell activity stands out as potentially malicious.\n\nI'm confident that this batch shows suspicious behavior, so it should be classified as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe creating scheduled tasks with calc.exe at logon using administrative privileges indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice several events where powershell.exe is loading different DLL files. These are ImageLoad events. Powershell is a common tool but can be used maliciously. However, just loading known DLLs might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there's an event where a file was created and then deleted in the same location: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating and immediately deleting files could indicate an attempt to bypass certain policies or delete evidence after execution, which is a red flag.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe runs a command that creates a scheduled task using calc.exe as the action. Using non-standard commands in Powershell and creating scheduled tasks can be signs of malicious activity, especially if it's trying to execute arbitrary programs like calc.exe at logon with elevated privileges.\n\nLooking further down, there are multiple RegistryEvent entries from chrome.exe setting registry values. While Chrome does interact with the registry, a high number of such events might indicate something unusual, but they're less concerning on their own unless they involve known malicious keys.\n\nToward the end, there's a series of events where tasks are executed with 'Execute a Remote Command'. This could imply remote code execution or command injection, which is definitely suspicious. Repeated attempts to execute remote commands without clear justification could be signs of an attack.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple powershell.exe activities including file creation\/deletion, scheduled task creation with calc.exe, and numerous remote command executions suggest potential malicious behavior. The combination of these events makes the batch interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including Powershell script execution attempts, file operations in Temp directory, creation of a scheduled task with calc.exe, and repeated remote command executions.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events. There are 10 JSONL entries here. Let me go through them one by one to understand what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first nine entries: all of these show that 'chrome.exe' is setting a registry value. The task field in each says 'Registry value set', and there's no file involved. That seems a bit repetitive, but maybe Chrome does this often for some configuration. I know Chrome can make changes to the registry when updating settings or extensions.\n\nThen, looking at the 10th event: it's another process, 'winlogbeat.exe', creating a file in the path 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads...\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. This seems normal if Winlogbeat is running and creating configuration files. I don't see any red flags here.\n\nThe 11th event is where things get interesting: 'powershell.exe' is creating a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_auxiliar.txt'. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it's also commonly exploited by attackers. Creating files with generic names could be part of malicious activity, like downloading malware components or writing scripts.\n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes multiple registry changes from Chrome and a file creation by Powershell. The first nine entries are not unusual on their own, but when combined with the Powershell event, it raises some concerns. However, without more context—like other suspicious activities, such as network connections or multiple processes accessing the same files—it's hard to say definitively if this is malicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards classification as \"INTERESTING\" because of the use of Powershell, which is a common tool for attackers. But my confidence isn't very high (maybe 0.6) since there's no additional evidence beyond these events.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes multiple registry changes by Chrome and a file creation by Powershell, which could indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". This could be normal admin activity or potentially malicious since remote commands can hide attacks. Nine times, the process field is empty, which might mean something's being hidden or executed without logging much detail.\n\nThen, I see a PowerShell command that schedules a task to run calc.exe at logon with highest privileges. That stands out because using scheduled tasks for persistence is a common tactic in cyberattacks. The fact that it's using the Administrators group and highest run level suggests an attempt to maintain high-level access.\n\nLooking further, there are several instances of svchost.exe making registry changes. Svchost is legitimate but often used by malware. The repeated registry writes could be setting up persistence mechanisms or altering system configurations maliciously.\n\nThere's also a new scheduled task named 'unidade_comum' created by the PowerShell script. Malware often uses such tasks to achieve persistence across reboots, making this a red flag.\n\nAdditionally, there are file creation events for .yml and .txt files in user directories, which could be related to storing malicious configurations or data. The use of non-standard paths like 'AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell' for such files might indicate an attempt to stay under the radar.\n\nWhile some entries look normal (like Chrome loading DLLs), the combination of remote command executions, scheduled task creations with elevated privileges, and multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe points towards potential malicious activity. The presence of PowerShell in creating these tasks and files further raises suspicion because it's a tool often used for scripting attacks.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% certain without more context. But given the patterns observed, it's reasonable to classify this batch as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events show suspicious activity including remote command executions, creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges, and registry modifications by svchost.exe.
