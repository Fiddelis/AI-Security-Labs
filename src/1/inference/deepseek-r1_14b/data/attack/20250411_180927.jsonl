{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, so I'm looking at this batch of system log events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, and others are being created or accessed. For example, there are multiple instances where 'cmd.exe' is used with command lines that add users or modify groups. That seems suspicious because creating new user accounts could be part of privilege escalation or setting up backdoors.\n\nLooking deeper, the command lines include adding users like \"modulo_geral_Admin\" and \"modulo_principal_Admin\" with temporary passwords. These names seem unusual and possibly related to a specific group or role, but without context, it's hard to say if they're legitimate. The use of net.exe and net1.exe for user additions further raises flags because these commands are often used in command-line attacks.\n\nThere are also several events where Registry values are being set by various processes like conhost.exe, svchost.exe, HxTsr.exe, and others. Modifying the registry can be a common tactic for malware to persistence or change system configurations. The fact that multiple different processes are doing this might indicate some level of automation or batch scripting.\n\nI also see events where files are being loaded into processes like OneDrive.exe and svchost.exe, which could be indicative of malicious activities if these files aren't legitimate. Additionally, there's an event where a file called BitsProxy.dll is being loaded by both OneDrive.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe, which might not be normal behavior.\n\nThe presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a configuration file seems benign unless it's part of some log tampering, but without more context, I can't be sure. The use of common applications like chrome.exe and Calculator.exe accessing registry values is unusual but could also be part of legitimate operations or just noise.\n\nConsidering all these events together, there are multiple indicators that suggest potential malicious activity, such as user account modifications, registry changes, and the use of command-line tools for administrative tasks. However, without additional context about the environment and the users, it's hard to definitively classify this as an attack. It could also be a legitimate admin performing maintenance.\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this batch as \"INTERESTING\" because there are several red flags that together might indicate malicious behavior. My confidence is around 0.7 because while individual events look suspicious, the lack of clear context makes it less certain.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected including user account modifications, registry changes, and potential persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem. I need to determine if a batch of log events is interesting or not for cybersecurity investigation.\n\nFirst, looking at the JSONL data provided, there are multiple entries from different processes. Most of them are from `chrome.exe` with tasks like 'Registry value set' and some file loads. There's also an entry from `winlogbeat.exe` creating a file and another from `powershell.exe` creating a text file.\n\nI know that `chrome.exe` is a legitimate application, so its normal operations shouldn't raise red flags unless there's unusual behavior. The repeated 'Registry value set' events could be part of Chrome's standard operation, like setting user preferences or extensions.\n\nThe `winlogbeat.exe` entry seems related to log management. It's creating a configuration file, which is typical for such tools and doesn't indicate malicious activity.\n\nThen there's the `powershell.exe` process creating a text file. PowerShell can be used both legitimately and maliciously, but without additional context like command execution or writes to unusual locations, this event isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, none of these events indicate signs of an active attack or unauthorized access. They seem consistent with normal system operations, especially considering the prevalence of Chrome activities. There's no evidence of file deletions, network connections, or other red flags that would suggest malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events appear to be normal system activity, including registry changes and file loads by legitimate processes like Chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and PowerShell.exe. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}\n```"}
