{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this batch of system logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of events related to powershell.exe. That's a red flag because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, the mere presence is something to note.\n\nLooking at the specific actions: There are multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs like clrjit.dll and mscoreei.dll. These are typical for .NET framework processes, so not necessarily suspicious on their own. However, the frequency might be worth looking into—maybe it's part of a script that's loading many modules.\n\nThere's also a FileCreate event in the Windows Temp directory: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_wf5ajhez.sfd.psm1'. Temporary PowerShell files can be part of legitimate scripts or malicious activity. This file path seems arbitrary, which might indicate it's generated by a script, possibly to test execution policies.\n\nAnother point is the command line from one event where powershell.exe is run with an ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The script then uses Get-Item and checks for specific .inf files. Using the restricted policy could be an attempt to lower privileges but might also indicate that the script is trying to avoid running malicious code in a more permissive environment.\n\nAdditionally, there's a whoami.exe process created. While this command can be used benignly to check user information, it's often used by attackers to gather system details before moving further. The fact that it's executed alongside powershell activity might suggest it's part of a larger script or malicious sequence.\n\nConsidering all these events together: multiple powershell processes, file creations in temp directories, loading various DLLs, and using whoami.exe—this could be indicative of a script trying to map the environment or potentially deploying malware. The combination suggests some level of investigation is warranted, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively if it's malicious.\n\nI'm also thinking about possible benign scenarios where scripts are run during system setup or maintenance, which might explain the repeated powershell.exe calls and file creations. However, the specific actions, like checking for .inf files and creating a temp PowerShell script file, lean more towards potential malicious activity.\n\nOverall, while not conclusive evidence of an attack, there's enough concerning behavior to merit closer inspection.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe processes with suspicious activities including loading various DLLs, creating temporary files, and using restricted execution policies.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of log events and trying to figure out if they're interesting from a cybersecurity perspective. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nThe first event shows \"cmd.exe\" being executed with the command line that includes Dism.exe with several parameters. The task is Process Create, which is normal for running executables. But I notice the command-line arguments are trying to disable Windows Defender and remove it without restarting. That sounds suspicious because disabling antivirus can lower system security.\n\nThe second event is PowerShell being accessed, but there's no file involved. I'm not sure what to make of this yet—maybe it's just a legitimate use or maybe something else.\n\nNext, the third event again shows Dism.exe being created with similar command-line arguments as the first event. So now we have two separate instances where Dism is being used to disable Windows Defender.\n\nLooking at the fourth to fourteenth events, they all involve Dism.exe accessing various files in a temporary directory. The files include .dll and .mui files, which are common for system components, but the fact that multiple DLLs are being accessed and created might indicate something malicious. Also, the paths seem unusual with long GUID-like names in the temp folder.\n\nI'm thinking about what Dism.exe does normally—it's used for servicing Windows, like enabling or disabling features. But using it to remove Defender could be an attempt to prevent detection mechanisms. The repeated file accesses and creations might be part of a larger payload being unpacked or executed.\n\nAnother point is that the events are all happening in quick succession, which isn't typical user behavior. It seems more automated, possibly script-driven.\n\nPutting it all together, these activities could indicate an attempt to remove security features (like Defender) and perhaps install malicious software. The combination of command-line arguments and multiple file accesses suggests a possible attack.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch shows multiple instances of Dism.exe being used with commands to disable Windows Defender, potentially indicating an attempt to lower system security.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So I'm given a bunch of JSONL events where each line represents an event. Each event has three keys: process, winlog, and file.\n\nLooking at the first few lines, the process is always 'Dism.exe'. Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, which I remember is used in Windows for servicing operating system images. It's a legitimate Microsoft tool, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThe winlog key says the task is \"File Executable Detected\" with a rule named FileExecutableDetected. That sounds like something related to detecting executable files being created or accessed. But since this is part of the Windows logging, it could just be monitoring normal file operations.\n\nNow, looking at the 'file' paths: all of them are under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with a specific GUID-like folder name. The filenames vary but end with .mui, which I think stands for Microsoft User Interface files. These are usually resource files used by Windows applications for localization.\n\nSo each event is Dism.exe detecting an executable file in these temporary directories. But wait, the files detected aren't actual executables; they're MUI files. So maybe this is a false positive? Or perhaps Dism.exe is processing these as part of its usual operations.\n\nI should consider if seeing multiple such events from the same process over time is normal. If a legitimate tool like Dism.exe is handling several files in a temp directory, especially during an OS deployment or servicing operation, then this could be expected behavior.\n\nAlso, looking at how many events there are: I count 15 lines here. That's quite a few from the same process, but depending on what's happening, it might make sense if Dism.exe is iterating through several files in that temp directory.\n\nAnother angle to think about: Could this indicate some kind of malicious activity trying to hide under the guise of legitimate processes? For example, sometimes attackers use legitimate tools' names or behaviors. But in this case, since all events are consistent with Dism.exe accessing its own resource files and no other anomalies are mentioned (like unusual file hashes, access times outside normal operations, etc.), it's less likely to be malicious.\n\nI should also consider if the temp directory structure is standard. The GUID folder suggests it's a unique temporary directory created by an application, which is common for apps needing isolated spaces during runtime. So Dism.exe creating or accessing such directories isn't suspicious on its own.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe this activity is part of a script or automated process that's running multiple times, each time creating a new temp folder and processing these MUI files. That would explain the repeated events but wouldn't be malicious.\n\nI don't see any signs of file creation or modification outside what Dism.exe typically does. All the detected files are in a temporary directory, which is expected during servicing operations.\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to be cautious, especially with security logs, I don't see red flags here. The consistent process name, predictable file types being accessed, and standard temp directory structure suggest this is normal behavior for Dism.exe handling its resource files.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events describe legitimate activity by the `Dism.exe` tool accessing temporary files during an OS servicing operation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Identification**: The process `Dism.exe` is a known Microsoft tool used for managing Windows deployment images, indicating legitimate system operations.\n\n2. **Log Task Analysis**: Each event triggers a \"File Executable Detected\" log, which is part of normal file monitoring by the operating system.\n\n3. **File Path and Type**: The files accessed are `.mui` files within a temporary directory created by `Dism.exe`. These files are standard resource files used for localization in Windows applications.\n\n4. **Frequency of Events**: The occurrence of multiple events over time is expected when `Dism.exe` processes several files during servicing operations, such as deploying updates or creating installation images.\n\n5. **No Anomalies Detected**: All activities align with known behaviors of the tool and do not exhibit signs of malicious intent, such as unexpected file creation or access outside normal operation parameters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe events are part of standard operations performed by `Dism.exe` when handling temporary files during system servicing. There is no indication of suspicious activity in these logs."}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the events all seem related to processes involving 'dism.exe' and 'dismhost.exe'. These are part of the Windows Deployment Services, used for tasks like servicing operating systems, such as applying updates or performing installations. I've heard that these tools can be legitimate but sometimes misused by attackers because they have elevated privileges.\n\nLooking at the events, the first few entries show Dism.exe detecting executable files in a temporary directory. The paths are all under C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp with various .dll files. That's normal when running DISM-related commands because it extracts these components during operation.\n\nThen there are process creation and image load events for DismHost.exe, which is expected when DISM runs as it needs to launch helper processes. The command line parameter includes a GUID, which seems like a standard way to handle temporary operations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here—like failed logins, access to restricted areas, or attempts to execute scripts without proper permissions. All the file paths are within expected temporary directories, and the events are consistent with normal DISM operations.\n\nTherefore, while it's important to monitor such activities, especially if they occur outside standard operating hours or involve unusual files, in this case, everything looks legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs shows normal activity related to Windows Deployment Services.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this batch of system log events and decide if it's interesting or not. Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst, all the events are in JSONL format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. The first 12 lines involve 'DismHost.exe' loading various DLL files into memory. Each of these has a task labeled as \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" and points to different .dll paths under the same temporary directory.\n\nThen, on the 13th line, there's an event where 'DismHost.exe' terminates with a process termination task. That seems normal after loading all those DLLs; maybe it's just closing down.\n\nThe next four events are from 'Dism.exe', which is deleting some of these DLL files that were previously loaded by DismHost. The tasks here are \"File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)\" and the file paths match some of the ones loaded earlier. For example, it deletes 'AppxProvider.dll' and others.\n\nNow, thinking about what's happening here: DismHost.exe is part of the Windows Deployment Services, used for installing and configuring Windows. It loads several provider DLLs which are normal during deployment processes. The deletion by Dism.exe could be part of a cleanup process after deploying or servicing the system.\n\nThe fact that all these files are in a temporary directory (AppData\\Local\\Temp) suggests they're temporary and meant to be deleted after use, which is standard for such operations. There's no indication of unusual file paths or access outside the expected locations.\n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. All events seem related to legitimate system processes: loading necessary modules during deployment and cleaning up afterward by deleting them. The repeated deletion might raise an eyebrow, but in this case, it's part of a normal procedure for deploying updates or images.\n\nSo overall, while there are several entries, they don't point to anything suspicious. They're all within expected behavior for the DismHost and Dism processes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of system log events is not indicative of malicious activity. The logs document legitimate operations involving 'DismHost.exe' loading necessary DLLs during deployment and subsequent cleanup by 'Dism.exe'. All activities occur in a temporary directory, consistent with normal system procedures. Therefore, the events are not considered suspicious.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe batch of log events is not interesting as they represent normal system processes related to Windows deployment services, including legitimate file loading and deletion activities."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this batch of JSONL events. Each event shows that Dism.exe is involved in file operations.

It's not uncommon for Dism.exe to modify or delete temporary files during normal operations, especially when deploying updates or configurations.\n\nThe file paths are all within a Temporary folder under the user's AppData directory, which aligns with typical temporary file management.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events that were provided. Each event is a JSON object representing some log entry. The first thing I notice is that every single event has the same structure: the process name is \"Dism.exe\", the winlog task is related to deleting a file (logged under FileDeleteDetected), and each one deletes a different DLL file from the same temporary directory.\n\nI recall that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Service Manager. It's a Microsoft tool used in deploying Windows images, like during installation or updates. So it's normal for this process to create and delete files in temp directories as part of its operations. \n\nLooking at the files being deleted, they all have names like \"Provider.dll.mui\" and similar. These seem to be language resource files (since \".mui\" typically stands for Multi-User Interface), which are related to system components. The paths also point to a specific temporary directory, which aligns with Dism's usual behavior of extracting and then cleaning up after itself.\n\nI'm checking each event: all have the same process name and similar file paths. Since they're all from the same user (fiddelis), in their local AppData folder under Temp, it seems consistent with legitimate operations during an imaging or deployment process.\n\nI don't see any unusual patterns here. Multiple file deletions by Dism.exe are expected when managing image files. There's no indication of file access outside normal operations or signs of malicious behavior like deleted system critical files or unexpected locations.\n\nSo considering all these points, this batch doesn't raise any red flags.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this batch of events. Each event is a JSON object representing some log data. The key fields are process, winlog, and file. Let me try to understand what each part means.\n\nFirst, the process name is always 'Dism.exe' in all these events. I remember that Dism.exe stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. It's a legitimate Windows utility used for servicing operating system images. So it's not something malicious by default.\n\nLooking at the winlog field, each event has the task as 'File Delete logged (rule: FileDeleteDetected)'. That suggests that a file was deleted and this action was logged by some monitoring rule related to file deletion detection. It's normal for such logs when files are removed from the system, especially during cleanup processes.\n\nThe file paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp followed by a unique identifier (33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89) and then various DLLs like FolderProvider.dll, GenericProvider.dll, etc. Temporary folders often have files that are created and deleted regularly, especially during software installations or updates.\n\nI also notice that each event has a different file being deleted, but all from the same temporary directory. Since Dism.exe is known to handle image servicing, it's plausible that this tool is cleaning up after some deployment or servicing task. Temporary files are usually safe to delete as part of normal operations.\n\nThere are 14 events in total, each deleting a different DLL file from the same temp folder. The pattern seems consistent and repetitive. I'm thinking that these could be part of a legitimate cleanup process rather than malicious activity because malicious actors might not follow such a structured deletion pattern of specific DLLs.\n\nAnother point is that all events are similar, which makes me think it's part of a known process rather than multiple different actions. If it were malicious, there might be variations in the files deleted or other indicators of compromise.\n\nSo putting this together: legitimate tool (Dism.exe) deleting temporary files (DLLs) from a standard temp directory. This looks like normal system behavior, especially during post-update or servicing operations where temporary components are removed after use.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events represents legitimate activity by the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (Dism.exe) tool, which is used for servicing Windows OS images. The logs indicate that Dism.exe deleted several DLL files from a temporary directory as part of a cleanup process following deployment or servicing operations. This behavior is typical during normal system maintenance and is not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Process Name Identification:** All events involve 'Dism.exe,' a known legitimate Windows utility used for image servicing, not associated with malware.\n\n2. **Log Details Analysis:** Each log entry notes a file deletion event detected by a monitoring rule (FileDeleteDetected). This is a standard log for such actions, especially in system cleanup processes.\n\n3. **File Paths and Names:** The files deleted are DLLs located in a temporary directory under the user's AppData folder. Temporary files are commonly deleted as part of normal operations after they're no longer needed.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition:** The repetitive deletion of multiple DLLs from the same temp directory suggests a systematic cleanup process, consistent with Dism.exe's role in servicing and deployment tasks.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Maliciousness:** Given the legitimate nature of both the tool and its activity, coupled with the structured file deletion pattern, there is no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe events are legitimate system activities by Dism.exe, which is cleaning up temporary files after servicing operations. This behavior is normal and not indicative of a security threat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"event\": {\n    \"type\": \"info\",\n    \"description\": \"Legitimate file deletion by Dism.exe during cleanup of temporary files.\",\n    \"severity\": \"low\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. I'm looking at this JSON log data, and I see a bunch of entries about processes being created or accessed, registry changes, and file operations. The user is asking for help analyzing it, probably to detect any malicious activity.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry one by one. \n\nThe first entry has a long string that looks like a GUID or some kind of event identifier. Not sure what that means yet. Then there are several entries where different processes are being created or accessed. Services.exe and svchost.exe are common system processes, so those might be normal.\n\nI notice a lot of PowerShell activity. That's interesting because while PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it's often used by attackers for command-line control and can execute malicious scripts. The command lines show that PowerShell is accessing various .dll files and creating\/deleting temporary files. Specifically, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1, which is then deleted shortly after.\n\nI wonder why PowerShell would create and immediately delete a script. That could be a way to avoid detection or leave fewer traces. Malware often does this to execute malicious code without being easily spotted in the filesystem.\n\nAlso, the use of Registry value changes might indicate an attempt to persistence—like adding entries so that the malware runs on startup. Services.exe modifying registry keys could be part of legitimate operations, but it's something to watch out for.\n\nI should consider cross-referencing these events. The sequence shows creation of whoami.exe, which is a standard tool, but in the context of other PowerShell activities, maybe it's being used maliciously. The multiple ImageLoad events from different .dll files might be normal, but combined with other actions, they could be signs of something more.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these activities are malicious or just part of normal operations. For example, services.exe and svchost.exe are standard, so their actions alone aren't suspicious. However, the PowerShell behavior stands out because of the temporary script file and the command-line arguments that execute a script which might be trying to remove items from the Temp directory.\n\nI should also check if there's any known malware that uses similar techniques. The use of powershell.exe with specific command lines could match certain attack patterns. Additionally, the fact that the script is immediately deleted after creation suggests an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, while some activities are normal, the PowerShell actions, especially the quick create and delete of a script, raise red flags for potential malicious behavior. I'd recommend further investigation into these specific events, possibly using more advanced tools or correlating with other logs to see if there's a pattern indicating an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log data contains information about various processes being created, accessed, and modified on a system, as well as file operations and registry changes. Here's a breakdown of the key observations and potential implications:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Process Activity**:\n   - The `services.exe` process is creating or accessing registry values.\n   - `svchost.exe` (a common Windows process) is also interacting with registry values.\n   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are being created and accessed, with some instances executing commands that involve file operations.\n\n2. **File Operations**:\n   - A temporary PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) is being created in the user's Temp directory.\n   - The same script is deleted shortly after its creation.\n\n3. **Registry Activity**:\n   - There are multiple registry value set operations, which could indicate changes to system configurations or persistence mechanisms (e.g., adding startup entries).\n\n4. **Network and Other Operations**:\n   - Some of the processes are loading various DLLs, which is common for legitimate Windows processes but could also be indicative of malicious activity if these DLLs are loaded from unexpected locations.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script file raises suspicions. This behavior is often associated with attempts to execute malicious code while leaving minimal traces.\n- The repeated use of `powershell.exe` in the logs could indicate the execution of scripts that might be attempting to perform unauthorized actions on the system.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity**:\n   - Review the exact command-line arguments for each `powershell.exe` instance to understand what commands are being executed.\n   - Look for any signs of malicious scripting, such as attempts to access sensitive files or network resources.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes**:\n   - Identify which registry keys were modified and assess whether these changes are legitimate or potentially harmful.\n\n3. **Review File Operations**:\n   - Confirm the contents of the temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) to determine if it contains malicious code.\n   - Ensure that there is no persistence mechanism (e.g., registry startup entries) that could allow unauthorized access or persistence.\n\n4. **Monitor for Additional Activity**:\n   - Keep an eye out for any other unusual process activity, network connections, or file operations that might indicate further malicious behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe log data suggests some potentially suspicious activity, particularly the creation and deletion of a temporary PowerShell script. While not conclusive evidence of malicious intent, it is advisable to investigate these activities further to ensure the system's security."}

Let me walk through each step.\n\nFirst, the events are all JSONL format, with each line being a separate event. The key fields here are \"process,\" \"winlog,\" and \"file.\" \n\nLooking at the first few entries, I see multiple instances where powershell.exe is running. That's interesting because PowerShell can be used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. So, my initial thought is to keep an eye on what these scripts are doing.\n\nIn the early events, powershell.exe is involved in tasks like creating pipes, loading images (clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll), creating files, accessing registry values, and process access. These could be normal operations for a script, but I'm cautious because some of these actions can be signs of malicious behavior, especially when combined.\n\nThen, towards the end, there are several events with command lines that execute specific PowerShell commands. For example:\n- The command writes \"Final result: 1\" or \"0.\" That's concerning because it might indicate a script is checking for something and setting a variable based on findings.\n- Another command lists INF files in the Windows directory and checks if they contain specific patterns related to installation sections. This could be part of a routine check, but in some cases, malicious scripts use such methods to detect or drop payloads.\n\nI also notice that many events have \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These are typical for PowerShell as it starts up, but repeated calls might indicate something more involved.\n\nWhat's making me pause is the combination of activities:\n1. Multiple powershell.exe instances.\n2. Accessing various system components (registry, files).\n3. Commands that check for specific patterns in system files which could be indicators of malicious behavior trying to avoid detection or preparing for payload execution.\n\nWhile some of these actions alone aren't necessarily suspicious, the overall pattern across multiple events raises flags. The repeated checks and writes might suggest a script is verifying its environment or attempting to establish persistence.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate system check or script execution. But given the nature of cybersecurity threats, especially with PowerShell being a common tool for attackers, I'm leaning towards classifying this as interesting.\n\nI'm not entirely certain, but considering all these points together, there's enough to warrant closer examination.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple powershell.exe instances show activity including file creation, registry access, and script execution which may indicate potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few events, they all have a similar command line involving powershell.exe with ExecutionPolicy Restricted. The command seems to be checking for specific patterns in INF files located in the Windows directory. It's searching for lines that match certain device installation sections like [defaultinstall.nt...]. So this script is probably trying to detect if there are any installed devices or perhaps looking for signs of hardware changes.\n\nThe next set of events also involve powershell.exe, but these commands are removing files from the Temp directory. The command is deleting all ZIP files that match a specific pattern, like *entrada_principal.zip. This could be part of cleanup operations, maybe after extracting some files or to remove temporary files no longer needed.\n\nNow, considering the tasks in Windows logs (winlog), some events mention 'Provider Lifecycle' and others 'Engine Lifecycle'. These typically relate to system services starting, stopping, or managing components. The combination here is that powershell is being used for both file operations and interacting with system services.\n\nI wonder if this activity is normal. Running Powershell scripts that access system files and perform deletions could be part of legitimate administration tasks, but it's also a common technique for malware to hide traces. The fact that the same commands are repeated multiple times across different log entries suggests either a script running in a loop or perhaps multiple processes being spawned.\n\nThe confidence level is high because while each individual command might not be suspicious on its own (like deleting temp files), the repetition and specific patterns (looking for INF sections) could indicate malicious activity. It's possible that an attacker is trying to remove evidence or check for certain system configurations that could be exploited.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands show file operations and system service interactions, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
