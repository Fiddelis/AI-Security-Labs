{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm given a bunch of log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation or not. The output should be a JSON object with classification as INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nLooking at the logs, I see that most of them involve 'chrome.exe' making network connections and DNS queries. These seem pretty normal because Chrome is a common browser and it does make network requests all the time. So, nothing suspicious there.\n\nThen, there's a series of events from 'powershell.exe'. The first thing that catches my eye is that PowerShell is being used with command lines that start other processes. For example, one log shows the command line as \"powershell.exe & {Start-Process \\\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\script.bat\\\"}\". This looks like PowerShell is executing a script or batch file. On its own, using PowerShell isn't unusual, but certain commands can be red flags.\n\nNext, I notice that PowerShell accesses registry values and loads various DLLs. These actions are common for legitimate processes too, so they don't immediately raise concerns. However, the creation and deletion of temporary files in specific paths could indicate something is being done under the radar. The file created is '__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1', which suggests it's a PowerShell script test file.\n\nThe more concerning part comes with multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events from different command lines, each starting a new process to execute .bat files in various paths. This seems repetitive and could indicate an automated or malicious process trying to run scripts across the system. The varied and somewhat obfuscated paths might be an attempt to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, while individual actions aren't necessarily suspicious, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes executing different scripts from various locations does raise eyebrows. There's a pattern that suggests some level of automation or potential script execution that could be malicious. However, without more context on whether these scripts are legitimate or known to be part of system operations, it's hard to be certain.\n\nSo, my initial thought is that this batch should be classified as INTERESTING because there are red flags with PowerShell and multiple file operations. But I'm not entirely confident because some actions could still be normal user activity.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of powershell.exe executing scripts and batch files, along with suspicious file creation and deletion patterns, suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of log events is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through each event carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice a lot of entries where PowerShell is being executed with some command-line arguments. For example, the first few lines show powershell.exe starting other processes like .bat files. That's a bit concerning because PowerShell can be used maliciously, but it's also common for legitimate scripts. So on its own, that might not be enough to flag.\n\nThen there are entries from Chrome and cmd.exe. I see several instances where Chrome sets registry values. That could just be normal browser activity, but repeated Registry writes might indicate something more suspicious. Maybe they're trying to persist across reboots?\n\nLooking at the file paths in the command lines, like C:\\objeto_padrao\\tarefa_ativo\\.. and others, those seem a bit arbitrary. It's hard to tell if that's normal or not without knowing what the scripts are supposed to do.\n\nThere's also an entry where ApplicationFrameHost.exe accessed something. That process is typically associated with Windows apps, so maybe nothing wrong there unless it's accessing restricted areas.\n\nAnother thing I spot is several entries of 'Registry value set' across different processes—Powershell, Chrome, cmd.exe. Accumulatively, that could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes that shouldn't happen during normal operation.\n\nI'm also noting that the events cover a range of tasks: creating processes, image loads, file creations. The variety makes me think it's part of a larger process chain, which might be indicative of lateral movement in an attack. Each step could be a piece of an infection or setup phase.\n\nThe repeated Registry writes from different sources are raising my suspicions. Attackers often use the Registry to maintain persistence. Additionally, some files being accessed, like MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll, seem normal but are being loaded by PowerShell, which is more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, these events show multiple processes making changes across the system—Registry edits, file creations, process starts. While individually they might not be alarming, collectively they suggest potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell with command-line arguments to start other scripts is a common tactic for attackers to execute payloads and maintain persistence.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I'm leaning towards classifying this batch as interesting because the combination of events could indicate an attack chain or malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple processes including PowerShell executing scripts, registry modifications, and file access suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}\n```"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this batch of system logs is interesting or not. Let's go through each event one by one and see if anything stands out.\n\nThe first event shows cmd.exe setting a registry value. That's normal since command prompt can do that. Next is conhost.exe doing the same thing—registry writes are common for some processes, especially those related to Windows internals.\n\nThen there's chrome.exe setting registry values multiple times. Chrome is known to make frequent changes to the registry for things like extensions or settings. So far, nothing suspicious here.\n\nLooking further, I see chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. That's the Anti-Malware Scan Interface, which is part of Windows Defender. It's expected that legitimate processes load this DLL for security purposes. The other file loaded from Windows Defender's directory also seems normal; it's likely part of their operations.\n\nThere are multiple instances where svchost.exe and powershell.exe create files. Svchost is a common host process for services, so creating files isn't unusual unless the file paths look suspicious. Powershell can do legitimate things like downloading files or writing to disk, but without seeing the actual content or command, it's hard to tell.\n\nI also notice winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files—it makes sense if that's a monitoring tool running on the system.\n\nThe fact that chrome.exe has multiple registry writes could be concerning in some contexts, especially if they're happening rapidly. However, given that it's a web browser with many components, this is likely normal unless there's an unusual volume or specific keys being modified.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether these events are part of a larger pattern. For instance, multiple registry writes without any file creation or network activity might not be enough on their own. But if I had more context, like timestamps or event IDs, it could help assess the risk better.\n\nOverall, while there's some activity that catches my attention, nothing in this batch clearly indicates malicious behavior. The events are mostly standard operations for these processes.\n<\/think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily involve normal system processes and common activities such as registry modifications by Chrome and file creation by legitimate tools.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}\n```"}
