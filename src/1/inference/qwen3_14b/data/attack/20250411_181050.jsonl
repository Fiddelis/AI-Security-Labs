{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's chrome.exe, which is normal, but then there's whoami.exe, which is often used to check user privileges. Then powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are common but can be used for malicious activities. The certutil.exe commands stand out because they're being used to encode and decode files. That's suspicious because certutil is typically used for certificate utilities, not for encoding files. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a line with certutil -encode and then -decode, which suggests someone is trying to encode a file (calc.exe) and then decode it into a temporary file. That could be part of obfuscating malicious code. Also, the creation of multiple temporary files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory might be an attempt to hide the malicious activity. \n\nThere's also the SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. While those are legitimate DLLs, if they're being loaded by an unknown or suspicious process, that could indicate a malicious module. However, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's a red flag. \n\nThe other events like registry value sets and process creations are common, but when combined with the certutil usage and the suspicious process names, it points towards potential malicious behavior. The presence of multiple certutil events encoding and decoding files, along with the creation of executable files in temporary directories, increases the likelihood of this being a security incident. \n\nI should check if there are any indicators of compromise. The use of certutil for encoding and decoding is often seen in malware distribution. Also, the temporary files being created and executed might be part of a payload delivery mechanism. \n\nThe justification would be the combination of certutil's unusual usage, the creation of executable files in temp directories, and the loading of DLLs by non-standard processes. These factors together suggest a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for file encoding\/decoding (common in malware), creation of executable files in temporary directories, and non-standard process behaviors (e.g., SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs). These indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events here are related to chrome.exe. There are multiple entries where chrome.exe is making network connections, which is normal behavior for a browser. But then there's an entry where powershell.exe creates a file named 'componente_auxiliar.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's a bit unusual because while PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, creating a file in Downloads might not be suspicious on its own, but it's worth noting.\n\nNext, there are several events where chrome.exe is setting registry values. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys or adding persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, like which specific registry keys are being changed, it's hard to tell if this is malicious. But repeated registry events from chrome.exe might indicate something's up, especially if it's not typical for the browser.\n\nThen there's an event where SDXHelper.exe loads urlmon.dll from the System32 directory. SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, and loading urlmon.dll, which is part of Internet Explorer, might be normal in some contexts. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate application, this could be okay. But if it's a malware dropper or something else, that's a problem. However, since the path is System32, which is a trusted directory, it's a bit less suspicious, but still needs attention.\n\nAnother event is winlogbeat.exe creating a new YAML file in its data directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, and creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The filename has a .new extension, which might indicate it's a temporary file during configuration updates. That seems normal, but again, depends on the context.\n\nThen there are a couple of events where powershell.exe is accessing processes. Process access can be part of legitimate operations, like scripts interacting with other processes. However, if it's being used to inject code or monitor other processes, that's a concern. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, the majority of events are from chrome.exe doing normal things like network connections and registry changes. The powershell.exe events are a bit more concerning, especially the file creation and process access. The SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll is also a point of interest. However, none of these events alone are strong indicators of malicious activity. They might be part of normal user behavior or legitimate processes. But the combination of multiple unusual events, even if not clearly malicious, might warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while there's no clear attack, the presence of several potentially suspicious activities could indicate something worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe network connections and registry modifications, combined with PowerShell file creation and process access events, suggest potential benign user activity or early-stage reconnaissance. The presence of SDXHelper.exe loading urlmon.dll (a legacy IE component) adds mild suspicion but lacks definitive malicious indicators.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
