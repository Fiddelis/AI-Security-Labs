{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The first event stands out: WMIC.exe loaded a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender's real-time protection. But why is WMIC.exe loading it? WMIC is a legitimate tool, but it's often abused by attackers. However, the file path here is in the ProgramData directory under Defender. That's a bit suspicious because Defender's files are usually in System32 or other protected directories. Maybe it's a legitimate update, but the combination with other events might be a clue.\n\nLooking at the other events, there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. Many of them are setting registry values. That's common in malware for persistence or configuration. Then there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries: \"cmd.exe \/c copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". Wait, that's replacing the Sticky Keys executable with a backup file. That's a classic sign of a malicious payload, like the \"Sticky Keys\" hack used by attackers to replace system files. \n\nAlso, there's a schtasks.exe command deleting a task named \"win32times\". That could be an attempt to remove a scheduled task that might be part of a defense mechanism or a legitimate task. The use of schtasks with the \/delete command might be trying to clean up traces.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events. That could indicate someone is trying to access or manipulate processes, which is often part of a larger attack. The whoami.exe executions are normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, they might be part of a reconnaissance phase.\n\nSo the first event is a legitimate Defender DLL being loaded by WMIC, but the other events, especially the command to replace sethc.exe and the registry changes, are more concerning. The combination of these events suggests that while some are normal, others are indicative of an attack. The confidence is medium because there's a mix of normal and suspicious activities, but the replacement of sethc.exe is a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains a suspicious event where WMIC.exe loaded a DLL from a Windows Defender directory, combined with multiple registry modifications and a command to replace the Sticky Keys executable (sethc.exe) with a backup file, which is a known attack technique.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. First, I see that the majority of the events are related to registry changes and process access, which are common in normal system operations. However, there are a few points that stand out.\n\nLooking at the first event, schtasks.exe loaded taskschd.dll from the System32 directory. That seems normal because schtasks is a legitimate Windows tool. But then, chrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface, so that's normal. MpOAV.dll is from Windows Defender as well. But why is chrome.exe loading these? Maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malware might abuse these DLLs. However, the paths here are standard, so maybe not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe and cmd.exe, with registry value sets and process accesses. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a standard tool. The presence of multiple registry changes could indicate someone trying to modify system settings. However, without more context like unusual commands or unexpected registry keys, it's hard to say.\n\nThe 'whoami.exe' process is being created, which is normal for checking user identity. But if that's part of a larger pattern, like lateral movement, it could be a red flag. However, in isolation, it's not suspicious.\n\nThe repetition of events, like multiple registry value sets from chrome.exe and powershell.exe, might suggest automated scripts or tools running. But again, without seeing the actual commands or the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to determine if they're malicious.\n\nI need to check if there's any combination of events that could indicate compromise. For example, if a malicious DLL was loaded, or if there's a sequence of commands that suggest privilege escalation. But in the given data, the only non-standard file load is the amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe, which are legitimate. The rest are standard processes and registry events.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there's a lot of activity, none of the events seem to be clearly malicious. The presence of legitimate tools and standard system files makes me think this is not a security incident. However, the high volume of registry changes and process accesses could be worth monitoring, but without more context, I can't confirm it's malicious. Therefore, the classification is likely 'NOT INTERESTING' with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events reflect standard system operations and legitimate process behaviors (e.g., registry modifications by Chrome, PowerShell, and CMD, which are common in normal user activity).

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: 'whoami.exe' is run, which is a normal command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is common, but the tasks associated with them might be a clue. \n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', 'Image loaded', 'File created', 'File Delete logged', 'Pipe Created'. Some of these are normal, but the repetition of certain events might indicate something. \n\nWait, there's a lot of 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's part of the .NET runtime, so maybe PowerShell is being used in a way that's typical. However, there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag, like a script being executed and then cleaned up. \n\nAlso, the command line for some PowerShell processes is '& {}', which is an empty script block. That might be a way to bypass execution policies or something. But why so many of them? There are multiple entries with the same command line. \n\nAnother thing is the 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. Those might relate to event logging or something else. But combined with the other events, maybe there's some malicious activity. However, the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file could be part of a legitimate log collection process. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the batch is interesting. The key points here are the repeated PowerShell activities, the loading of .NET components, the creation and deletion of a temporary file. But without more context, like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or access to sensitive files, it's hard to say. \n\nHowever, the fact that there's a file created in the Temp directory and then deleted might be an indicator of a script being run temporarily. Also, the multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' events could be related to something trying to hide its tracks. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nConsidering all this, it's not definitively malicious, but there are enough suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. So the classification would be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.65. The justification is the combination of PowerShell activities, temporary file creation\/deletion, and multiple image loads that might indicate an attempt to execute scripts or evade detection.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process creations, registry modifications, and image loads of .NET components (e.g., clr.dll, mscoree.dll) suggest potential script execution or payload delivery.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, whoami.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, chrome.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe. Some of these are common system processes, like svchost.exe and calc.exe, but others like powershell.exe and cmd.exe can be used for malicious purposes.\n\nNow, the winlog tasks: Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created. The Image loaded events mention urlmon.dll and amsi.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unexpected context, that might be a red flag. Also, amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a malicious process is trying to bypass AMSI, that could be an issue. However, in the events provided, it's just the ImageLoad event, so maybe just normal operations.\n\nLooking at the command lines: there's a cmd.exe command that uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes. That seems odd. Why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe trying to remove a process that's being used for something else. Also, the WMIC.exe process has a command line that deletes notepad.exe processes. That's suspicious because WMIC is often used in attacks for executing commands remotely. \n\nAnother thing is the file created event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of setup, but if it's in the Downloads folder and named with .new, maybe it's part of an installation or configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to say if that's malicious.\n\nThere are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry values being set. PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for executing scripts. However, just having ProcessAccess events isn't necessarily malicious unless there's a specific script or command involved. The events here don't show the commands, though.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry value sets might indicate changes to the system configuration. If an attacker is modifying registry keys to persist or hide their activities, that's a concern. But again, without knowing which keys are modified, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe cmd.exe and WMIC.exe events are more concerning. The command to delete notepad.exe processes could be part of a larger attack, like trying to remove a process that's being monitored or is a decoy. Also, using WMIC to delete processes is unusual and might indicate an attempt to evade detection.\n\nPutting this all together: the batch has some suspicious activities, especially the use of WMIC and cmd to delete processes, along with multiple registry changes and PowerShell activity. However, some of these could be benign. The confidence isn't 100% because there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads or clear indicators of compromise, but the combination of events does raise flags. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: 1) Use of WMIC and cmd.exe to delete notepad.exe processes (unusual behavior). 2) Repeated registry modifications by various processes. 3) PowerShell execution events combined with image loading of system DLLs (potential evasion techniques). 4) File creation of winlogbeat configuration file in user Downloads directory (possible configuration changes).\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

That's a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces. \n\nThen there are a few events where PowerShell is checking if certain paths exist, which might be part of a script trying to locate files.

That seems legitimate, maybe part of normal operations. But then there's a File created event in the user's AppData directory. Creating files there might be normal, but combined with other events?\n\nNext, there are several Registry value set events. Changing registry values can be a red flag, especially if it's modifying keys related to security or startup. But the logs don't specify which registry keys, so that's a bit unclear.\n\nThen, there are multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that check for the existence of certain .bat files. The paths here are a bit odd. They have ..\\.. which might be trying to navigate up directories. For example, \"C:\\\\entrada_principal\\\\unidade_auxiliar\\\\..\\\\elemento_geral\\\\objeto_ativo_script.bat\" – the ..\\ could be an attempt to access parent directories, maybe to bypass path restrictions or hide the real location.\n\nAlso, there are several Process Create events for PowerShell, which is normal, but when combined with the file checks and registry changes, it might indicate someone is trying to execute scripts or modify system settings. The fact that multiple PowerShell instances are checking for these .bat files could be part of a script that's looking for payloads or trying to determine if certain files exist before proceeding.\n\nThe Image loaded events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are part of the .NET framework, so that's probably legitimate.

That's a common tool, but it's also often used in malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first event has a command line where PowerShell is creating a new item and setting content to a batch file with the command \"dir\". That seems suspicious because creating files and writing commands might be part of an attack. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries with similar patterns. Each time, PowerShell is creating a new item (New-Item) and then setting content to a batch file with \"dir\". The paths are all over the place, which could be an attempt to hide or spread the malicious activity. Also, the \"Provider Lifecycle\" task in some events might indicate something related to PowerShell providers, which can be used for file system manipulation.\n\nThen there are events about image loaded, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are .NET components, which are normal, but when combined with PowerShell activities, it might indicate the use of .NET in scripts. However, the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll being loaded could be a red flag, but I'm not sure if that's benign or not.\n\nThe repetition of creating batch files with \"dir\" in different directories might be a way to execute commands or leave backdoors. The use of \"..\\\" in paths could be trying to navigate up directories, which is sometimes used in attacks to avoid detection. \n\nHowever, I should check if all these are legitimate. For example, creating batch files could be part of normal software installation or configuration. But the combination of multiple such events, along with registry changes and image loads, might indicate a more complex attack. \n\nThe justification needs to be concise. The key points are the repeated PowerShell activities creating and modifying files, the use of potentially suspicious paths, and the loading of various DLLs.

For example, there's a command line that uses New-Item and Set-Content to create batch files and write \"dir\" into them. That seems a bit odd. Usually, legitimate scripts might create files, but doing so in a way that involves multiple directories with dots and double dots (like ..\\modulo_base) could be a red flag.

Also, the same script is creating another file in a different path, which again uses ..\\ to navigate directories. This could be an attempt to hide the real location of the file or to access restricted areas.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, PowerShell is loading several .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. That's normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple image loads might be part of a larger script or payload. However, I don't see any obviously malicious DLLs here. The Defender DLL is loaded too, which is part of Windows Defender, so that's legitimate.\n\nThere are also registry value set events, but no specific keys or values are mentioned, so it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The ProcessAccess events might indicate that the process is being accessed by other processes, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated creation of batch files with PowerShell, using paths that include parent directory references, and the fact that these files are being created and deleted. This could be part of a script that's trying to execute commands or set up persistence. However, since all the actions are within normal system directories and there's no indication of network activity, malware execution, or privilege escalation, it's not definitively malicious. But the pattern of creating and modifying files in a way that might be obfuscating the actual intent is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the events show PowerShell creating multiple files with potentially obfuscated paths, which could be indicative of malicious activity, even though there's no direct evidence of a threat.

PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in scripts, especially with commands that check for the existence of specific files, it can be a red flag. The command lines here have a pattern: they're using Test-Path to check if certain executable files exist in specific directories.

The paths mentioned are a mix of different directories, some with names like \"modulo_secundario\" and \"registro_logico\". The pattern here is that each command is checking for a specific .bat file in a constructed path. The structure of the paths seems a bit odd, with parts like \"..\\\\registro_logico\" which might be trying to navigate up a directory. But I'm not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there are other events where PowerShell is involved in file operations: creating a file in the Temp directory, deleting it, and loading DLLs from Windows Defender. The creation and deletion of a temporary script file might be normal, but the fact that it's named with a random string like \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_fknkvqh2.3fx.ps1\" could be part of a script execution. However, without seeing the actual content of the script, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nThe events also include image loads from Windows Defender, which are legitimate. The winlogbeat process creating a file in the Downloads directory is probably part of installing or configuring the tool, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNow, looking for patterns: multiple PowerShell commands checking for specific .bat files. The paths are all different but follow a similar structure. The use of Test-Path and exiting with 0 or 1 might be part of a script that's checking prerequisites or ensuring certain files are present. However, if these .bat files are not standard or are being created dynamically, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is that all these PowerShell commands are part of the \"Provider Lifecycle\" or \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. I'm not entirely sure what those tasks mean in the context of Windows logs, but if they're related to system management or automation, maybe this is part of a legitimate process. However, the repetition of similar commands across different paths might indicate an automated script that's trying to check multiple conditions, possibly to determine the environment before executing more complex actions.\n\nThe presence of multiple file operations (create, delete, load) with PowerShell could be normal, but combined with the Test-Path checks, it might be part of a larger operation. However, without more context, like the actual content of the .bat files or other suspicious activities, it's challenging to confirm malicious intent.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs don't show clear signs of a security breach. The activities seem to be within normal operational ranges, even if a bit repetitive. The use of PowerShell is common for administrative tasks, and the file operations in Temp directories are typical. The paths checked might be part of a legitimate script's setup. However, the repeated checking of multiple paths could be a bit unusual, which might warrant further investigation. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or execution of harmful code, the classification might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\".

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The first few events involve PowerShell.exe with tasks like Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. The files mentioned are in the Windows Defender directory and a temporary folder. The file paths look a bit suspicious, especially the one in the Temp directory. But then there's a deletion of that same file, which might be normal cleanup.\n\nNext, there are several events with PowerShell.exe and commands checking if certain files exist, like \"componente_secundario.exe\" and \"entrada_auxiliar.exe\". These checks might be part of a script that's trying to determine if specific binaries are present. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious or just a normal process.\n\nThere's also a \"Pipe Created\" event, which could be part of normal operations, but sometimes used in attacks. However, the other events don't show any obvious signs of exploitation or unauthorized access.\n\nLooking at the command lines, the PowerShell commands are using Test-Path to check for the existence of files. This could be part of a legitimate script, but if those files are not supposed to be there, it might be a red flag. However, the events don't show any actual malicious activity like downloading files, connecting to external IPs, or modifying critical system files.\n\nThe presence of multiple ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks might indicate that the process is interacting with the system in ways that could be benign, like configuration changes. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI also notice that some of the files are related to Windows Defender, which is a legitimate component. The MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are part of Microsoft's antivirus, so their loading is normal. However, the temporary files created and deleted might be part of a script that's being run, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe only other events are for whoami.exe and cmd.exe, which are standard utilities. The whoami.exe is just getting the user context, which is normal.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show any clear signs of an attack. There's a lot of PowerShell activity, which can be normal, but the lack of other suspicious activities (like network connections, unauthorized file modifications, etc.) makes me think this might be a false positive or part of a legitimate process. However, the repeated use of PowerShell and file checks could be worth looking into further, but not enough to classify it as definitely interesting. Maybe the confidence is around 0.4-0.5, but I need to check if there's anything I'm missing.\n\nWait, there's also a FileCreated event in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That might be related to PowerShell profiles, which can be used for persistent access. But again, without seeing the content of the file, it's hard to tell. The fact that the file is created and then accessed might be normal, but could be a sign of a script being loaded automatically.\n\nHmm, but the justification needs to be concise. The main points are: multiple PowerShell events, some file operations, but nothing clearly malicious. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, just normal operations.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are powershell.exe. That's common, but when combined with other events, it might be suspicious. There's also a whoami.exe, which is usually benign, but again, depends on context.\n\nThe winlog tasks include ProcessCreate, ProcessAccess, RegistryEvent, and ImageLoad. The ImageLoad events are loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them might be normal if PowerShell is running .NET scripts. However, the repeated access to ProcessAccess and ImageLoad could indicate something if there's a pattern.\n\nNow, looking at the command_line parameters in some of the processes. They all have similar structures: using Test-Path to check if a specific file exists and then exiting 0 or 1. The file paths mentioned are things like C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar\\... and others. These paths seem to be part of some project structure, maybe custom or application-specific. But why are they checking these paths repeatedly?\n\nWait, the command lines are all checking for the existence of certain .cs files (C# source files). If these files are part of a legitimate application, that's fine. But if they're checking for files that shouldn't be there, or if this is part of a larger malicious activity, that's a red flag. However, on its own, checking file existence isn't necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother point is the multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. PowerShell can use these to run scripts, but if there's no other suspicious activity, like network connections or registry changes, it might be normal. However, the combination of multiple ProcessAccess and ImageLoad events could be indicative of something trying to inject code or run a payload.\n\nBut wait, all the events here are related to PowerShell and .NET components. There's no mention of network activity, file modifications, or other suspicious processes. The only thing is the repeated checking of file paths. Maybe these are part of a legitimate application's startup checks. However, the fact that there are so many of these checks, each with different file paths, might be a sign of something automated or scripted.\n\nAnother angle: the use of PowerShell with .NET assemblies could be part of a malicious payload, like a dropper or a script that's downloading additional components. But without seeing network traffic or file creation events, it's hard to say. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs might be normal for PowerShell scripts that use .NET classes.\n\nHmm, but the confidence here is a bit tricky. If all these events are from a legitimate application, then it's not interesting. But if they're part of a malicious activity, like checking for specific files to determine the environment before proceeding with an attack, that's interesting. However, without more context, like other events (e.g., network connections, file modifications), it's hard to be certain.\n\nConsidering the justification, the key points are the repeated PowerShell processes, the ImageLoad of .NET DLLs, and the file existence checks. These could be part of a legitimate application, but they also could be part of a script that's probing the system. Since the events are all related to PowerShell and .NET, but there's no clear malicious activity, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. However, the fact that there are multiple ProcessAccess events and ImageLoads might be worth investigating further. Maybe the confidence is around 0.6 or 0.7. But I need to decide based on the given data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious file path checks and .NET DLL image loads, potentially indicating probing or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has a command line that checks if a file named Get-Keystrokes.ps1 exists. The same pattern repeats in other entries with different paths like \"C:\\\\registro_base\\\\entrada_base\\\\objeto_principal\\\\src\\\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" and others. The script seems to exit 0 if the file exists, else exit 1. \n\nWait, Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. The fact that the script is being checked for existence multiple times in different directories might indicate that the attacker is trying to locate or deploy this script. \n\nAlso, there are events related to file creation and deletion, like the temporary file __PSScriptPolicyTest_xvywze3f.peg.ps1 being created and then deleted. That could be part of an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. \n\nThe image loaded events include some .dll files from .NET and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might be part of the PowerShell process's normal operation, but combined with the other events, it could be a red flag. \n\nThe Pipe Created event might be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other suspicious activities, it adds to the concern. \n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file, which might be part of a legitimate log collection tool. But since the rest of the events are more suspicious, this might be a false positive or a legitimate activity. \n\nPutting it all together: the repeated checks for Get-Keystrokes.ps1, the creation and deletion of temporary scripts, and the use of PowerShell for these tasks are all indicators of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination suggests an investigation is warranted.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are checking for the existence of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' across different paths, which is a common indicator of keystroke logging malware.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell. The first event mentions 'Image loaded' for MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal, maybe part of legitimate processes. Then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. That could be normal script execution, but the deletion might be an attempt to clean up after themselves. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, so that's not necessarily bad. But then there are several PowerShell processes running with command lines that check for the existence of certain files. The paths mentioned are all over the place, like 'C:\\\\estrutura_temporario\\\\entrada_ativo\\\\tarefa_base\\\\src\\\\elemento_base.cs' and similar. These paths look a bit suspicious because they have a lot of directories with names that seem generated or not standard. Maybe they're trying to hide the actual location of their files.\n\nThen there's a 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed' events. Those could be part of normal operations, but combined with the other events, it might indicate something more. There's also a 'whoami.exe' process, which is a legitimate tool to check user identity. But the fact that it's being run in conjunction with all these PowerShell scripts might be worth noting.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, they all use 'Test-Path' to check if a specific file exists and then exit with 0 or 1. The files they're checking for are named things like 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1'. Wait, 'Get-Keystrokes' sounds like a script that captures keystrokes, which is a common component of keyloggers or malicious software. That's a red flag. Even though the scripts are just checking if the file exists, the presence of such a filename in the paths could indicate that the attacker is trying to execute or access a malicious script.\n\nAlso, the repetition of similar command lines with different paths might suggest that the attacker is probing multiple locations to find where the malicious script is stored. This could be part of an attempt to execute the script without directly referencing it, maybe to avoid detection. \n\nThe fact that multiple PowerShell processes are involved, along with file creation and deletion, registry changes, and process access, could be indicative of a more complex attack. Even though some of these events are normal, the combination and the specific filenames (like Get-Keystrokes) make this suspicious. \n\nI should also consider the confidence level. The presence of 'Get-Keystrokes' is a strong indicator, but without seeing the actual content of the files, it's not 100% certain. However, the pattern of checking for such files and the multiple paths suggest that there's a higher chance of malicious activity. So, the classification would be 'INTERESTING' with a confidence around 0.85. The justification is the presence of filenames associated with keystroke logging and the suspicious path structures.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are probing for files named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in non-standard, obfuscated paths, which is highly suspicious.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The user provided a list of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. The task is to look at all of them together and decide if they're worth looking into.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. The first one is chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. The third event is whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to get user info, but maybe used in malicious contexts. Then there's a lot of powershell.exe events, including process creation, registry changes, image loads, file creation and deletion, and pipe creation.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a recurring command: \"powershell.exe & {ls -recurse\\nget-childitem -recurse\\n...\" which seems like a script to list files recursively. That might be part of a malicious activity, like searching for files to exfiltrate or modify. The image loads include .NET DLLs, which could be part of a legitimate process, but combined with other events, maybe not.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the Temp directory could be a red flag. Malware often uses temp folders to store temporary files. Also, the repeated access to registry and process events might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or inject code. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events with .NET assemblies might be part of a PowerShell-based attack, like using .NET to execute malicious code.\n\nHowever, some of these could be normal. For example, PowerShell is commonly used by administrators. But the combination of multiple suspicious activities—like creating and deleting files in Temp, accessing the registry, and loading specific DLLs—might indicate a more malicious intent. Also, the fact that whoami.exe is run could be part of checking user privileges, which is a common step in attacks.\n\nI should check if there are any clear indicators of compromise. The events don't show obvious malware hashes or network connections, but the behavior is suspicious. The confidence level might be around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination suggests potential malicious activity. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" because the pattern of events is more than just normal usage.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities including file creation\/deletion in temp directory, registry modifications, and loading of .NET DLLs, combined with recursive directory enumeration, suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. There's a file created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That seems a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files in startup directories could be part of persistence mechanisms. Then there are registry value sets and process accesses. But I need to check if these are normal or not.\n\nNext, there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a legitimate command to check user identity. But it's run via PowerShell. Then notepad.exe and svchost.exe modifying the registry. Notepad is usually not a big concern, but svchost.exe is a system process, so if it's doing something unusual, that might be a red flag.\n\nThen there's calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but if it's being loaded by calc.exe, which is a simple calculator, that might not be normal. However, maybe it's part of a legitimate process. But then there's another entry for Calculator.exe (note the capitalization) loading the same dll. That might be a typo or a different process. Also, the path is correct, so maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal if it's part of setup. But the filename has a .new extension, which could indicate a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a lot of network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making multiple network connections is normal, especially if it's browsing. But svchost.exe making network connections could be part of system services, but if there's a lot of them, maybe something's up. Also, there's a DNS query from chrome.exe, which is normal for browsing.\n\nPutting this all together: the suspicious parts are the PowerShell activities, especially the file creation in the startup directory, multiple registry changes, and the process accesses. However, some of these could be legitimate. The winlogbeat activity seems normal. The chrome and svchost network activity is typical for a user browsing the web. The calc and Calculator loading urlmon.dll might be normal, but the capitalization difference between 'calc.exe' and 'Calculator.exe' could be a typo or a different process, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut the main red flags are the PowerShell events. Creating a startup file could be part of persistence. Multiple process accesses and registry changes might indicate someone trying to manipulate the system. However, without more context, like the user's normal behavior, it's hard to tell. But given that there's a combination of these events, even if some are normal, the presence of multiple suspicious activities might warrant further investigation.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries. There are multiple instances of powershell.exe running with the same command line: using ls, get-childitem, and gci with -recurse. That's a common PowerShell command to list files recursively. But why so many times? Maybe the user is just exploring the file system, but repeated commands could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, there's an event where the process is 'Image loaded' for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so probably not malicious. Then there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal during setup. But why is it in the Downloads directory? Maybe the user is installing it manually, which isn't necessarily bad.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created in the AppData directory for PowerShell's StartupProfileData. That could be part of a normal setup, but sometimes attackers use AppData for persistence. However, just creating a file there isn't conclusive evidence.\n\nThen there are registry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of legitimate configurations or malicious activities like persistence. But again, without seeing the specific registry keys or values, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother file created is 'estrutura_secundario.txt' in Downloads. That's a regular text file, so maybe just a user-created file. Not suspicious on its own.\n\nThe same winlogbeat.yml.new file is created twice. Maybe a configuration file being written, but again, not inherently malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple PowerShell commands, some file and registry changes. However, all the processes and files mentioned are associated with legitimate software (like Windows Defender, winlogbeat). The actions taken (like creating config files, using PowerShell for listing files) could be part of normal user activities or setup processes. There's no direct evidence of malicious behavior here, like downloading payloads, executing suspicious scripts, or accessing sensitive areas. The repetition of PowerShell commands might be a red herring, but without more context or anomalies, it's not enough to classify this as interesting for investigation.
