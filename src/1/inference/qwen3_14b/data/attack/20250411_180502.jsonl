{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if this is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe with DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then there's a powershell.exe process. \n\nLooking further, there's a process creation event for powershell.exe with a command line that starts a script. The command line shows a path that seems a bit odd with multiple backslashes and dots, maybe obfuscation? Then there are several image loaded events for .NET DLLs, which might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that use .NET, but I should check if any of these are unexpected.\n\nAlso, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common for malware to leave temporary files, but it's not definitive. Then there are multiple \"Provider Lifecycle\" events with different script paths. The paths have patterns like \"..\\\\..\" which might be trying to navigate directories, but again, could be legitimate if the scripts are part of normal operations.\n\nWait, the command lines in the Provider Lifecycle events have \"Start-Process\" with paths that include \"..\\\\..\" which could be an attempt to bypass path restrictions or hide the actual location. Also, the fact that there are multiple such events with different paths might indicate automated or scripted activity.\n\nThe image loads include some .NET components, which are normal for PowerShell, but the presence of Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll might be relevant. However, that's a legitimate file. \n\nThe file creation and deletion in Temp could be benign, but combined with the multiple PowerShell activities and the obfuscated paths, it might be worth looking into. The user is asking if the batch is interesting. Considering all these events together, there's a pattern of PowerShell executing scripts from various locations, possibly with obfuscation, which could be indicative of malicious activity. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the multiple PowerShell events and the suspicious paths, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute obfuscated scripts with suspicious path patterns (e.g., '..\\\\..\\\\'), and temporary files are created\/deleted, which may indicate malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of PowerShell being used with command lines that start other scripts. The paths in those commands have some suspicious patterns. For example, the first event has a command line that starts a process with a path like \"C:\\objeto_padrao\\tarefa_ativo..\\tarefa_ativo\\entrada_base_script.bat\". Wait, the path uses \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal. That's a red flag because it might be trying to access files outside the intended directory. Similarly, other PowerShell commands have similar paths with \"..\\\". \n\nNow, directory traversal in file paths can be a sign of malicious activity, like trying to access sensitive areas of the file system. Even though the scripts are named with generic terms like \"entrada_base_script.bat\", the use of relative paths with \"..\\\" might be an attempt to bypass security measures or access files that shouldn't be accessible.\n\nOther events involve normal processes like Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, and ApplicationFrameHost.exe. Their registry events might be benign, but the repeated registry value sets for chrome.exe could be normal behavior. However, the key here is the PowerShell events with the suspicious paths. \n\nThere's also an event where a file is created at \"C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". While creating files in AppData can be normal, if it's done without user interaction or in a non-standard way, it might be suspicious. However, this single event might not be enough on its own.\n\nThe presence of multiple PowerShell commands using directory traversal in their paths suggests a possible attempt to execute scripts from unexpected locations. This could be part of a broader attack, like trying to run malicious scripts that are hidden or obfuscated. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these paths might be legitimate. For example, if the scripts are part of a legitimate application's structure. But the use of \"..\\\" in the paths is still concerning. Also, the fact that there are multiple such events increases the likelihood that this is not a coincidence.\n\nAnother point is the combination of events. Even though there are other processes and registry changes, the PowerShell events with the suspicious paths are the standout. They could indicate someone trying to execute scripts in a way that's trying to avoid detection. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes with command lines that include directory traversal in their paths is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. This would warrant further investigation. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75 to 0.85. The justification is the repeated use of suspicious paths in PowerShell commands.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute commands with suspicious directory traversal patterns (e.g., '..\\\\tarefa_ativo\\\\...') in their file paths, which could indicate attempts to access or execute files outside intended directories. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity, such as obfuscation or bypassing security controls.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's cmd.exe, conhost.exe, chrome.exe, svchost.exe, powershell.exe, and winlogbeat.exe. The winlog events are mostly Registry value set, Image loaded, and File created. \n\nNow, the file paths mentioned are mostly system-related, like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll, which are part of Windows Defender. But wait, there's also some files created in the Downloads folder by the user, like componente_principal.txt and elemento_base.txt. Also, winlogbeat is creating a .yml.new file. \n\nHmm, chrome.exe is involved in several registry changes. But is that suspicious? Well, Chrome is a common application, but modifying the registry could be part of normal operations or something malicious. However, the fact that multiple registry events are logged for chrome.exe might be a red flag. \n\nThen there are the file creations. The user's Downloads folder has files created, which isn't necessarily bad, but the presence of winlogbeat might be a tool used for monitoring, but creating a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration change. However, the main concern here is whether these events are part of a legitimate activity or something malicious.\n\nWait, the ImageLoad events for chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably okay. But if an attacker is trying to inject code, they might load malicious DLLs. However, the paths here are correct. \n\nThe svchost.exe creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder is normal for Windows. Powershell.exe creating files in Downloads is common, but if there's a lot of such activity, it could be part of data exfiltration. However, in this batch, it's only two files. \n\nThe repeated registry changes by chrome.exe might be more concerning. But I need to check if there's a pattern. Are these registry changes related to persistence or something else? Without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of winlogbeat is a monitoring tool, so creating a configuration file is normal. However, the .new file suggests a temporary file, which might be part of an update or configuration change. \n\nPutting it all together: the events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The registry changes are for a legitimate process (chrome.exe), the file creations are in user directories, and the use of winlogbeat is normal. However, the high frequency of registry events might be unusual for chrome.exe. But without more information, like the specific registry keys modified, it's hard to confirm. \n\nSo the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.6 because there are some unusual events but no definitive signs of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal process behavior (e.g., chrome.exe registry modifications, legitimate file creations in user directories, and winlogbeat configuration updates). No clear malicious patterns or anomalous activity detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
