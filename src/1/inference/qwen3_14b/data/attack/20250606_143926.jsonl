{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143926.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's start by looking through each event.\n\nFirst, there's svchost.exe with a registry value set. That's a normal system process, so maybe not suspicious. Then powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is common, but if it's being accessed a lot, maybe that's a red flag. Then whoami.exe is run a couple of times. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's normal. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process that deletes a file called lsass_dump.dmp. That file is typically associated with memory dumps from LSASS, which is used in attacks like Pass-the-Hash or dumping credentials. Deleting that file might be an attempt to cover tracks. Also, the command line uses \/c del and redirects output to nul, which is common in cleanup steps.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process. Loading system DLLs from System32 might be normal, but if the process is not a legitimate one, that could be malicious. However, combase.dll and urlmon.dll are legitimate system files, so just loading them might not be enough. But the fact that SDXHelper is doing this multiple times could indicate something.\n\nPutting it all together: the deletion of lsass_dump.dmp suggests someone is trying to remove evidence of a memory dump, which is often done during attacks. The repeated access to PowerShell and the presence of SDXHelper, which isn't a standard process, might indicate malicious activity. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, just suspicious activities. So this is interesting but not a clear-cut attack. The confidence might be around 0.7 because there are indicators of compromise but not definitive proof.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of lsass_dump.dmp (common in credential extraction attacks), repeated PowerShell access, and non-standard process SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143926.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these log entries to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are about svchost.exe performing a registry value set operation. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, frequent registry changes by this process could be a red flag.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the logs don't show any unusual parameters or different registry keys being modified. All entries are the same: \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" with no details on which key or value was changed. That's a bit concerning because typically, if there's malicious activity, you'd expect to see specific registry keys being altered, like those related to persistence or disabling security features. But without more details, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlso, there are 30 entries here. If svchost.exe is legitimately running multiple services, maybe it's normal. However, repeated registry modifications might indicate something like a malicious payload trying to modify registry settings to maintain persistence. But again, without more context, like the specific registry paths or other processes involved, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe lack of variation in the log entries makes me think that maybe this is a false positive or a benign process. However, the high volume of the same event might still warrant further investigation. Since the user wants a classification based on the entire batch, the repetition of the same event by a known legitimate process might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a moderate confidence. However, I should check if there's any standard behavior for svchost.exe that involves frequent registry changes. From what I recall, svchost.exe can trigger registry events when services start or stop, but usually not in such a high frequency. So maybe this is abnormal. But without more data, it's tricky. I think the safest classification here is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 because the repetition might indicate something unusual, even if the process is legitimate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modification events by svchost.exe, a common host for Windows services, may indicate unusual behavior or potential persistence attempts if correlated with other suspicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143926.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice multiple instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being executed. That's common, but not necessarily malicious. However, there's a procdump.exe and procdump64.exe involved. Procdump is a legitimate tool, but it's often used in attacks to dump memory, like lsass.exe, which is a security risk. \n\nLooking at the command line for procdump, it's using -accepteula -ma lsass.exe to create a dump file in the Windows Temp directory. That's a red flag because dumping lsass can be part of credential theft, like in Pass-the-Hash or Kerberoasting attacks. \n\nAlso, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass_dump.dmp. Dumping lsass memory is a common technique used by malware to extract credentials. The presence of this file and the use of procdump with lsass are strong indicators of malicious activity. \n\nOther events include whoami.exe and hostname, which are normal commands, but the combination with the procdump activity suggests someone is trying to escalate privileges or extract sensitive information. The repeated access to powershell.exe might be part of the attack chain, like using it to execute commands or bypass defenses.\n\nThe fact that procdump is being run from a non-standard path (C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario) might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the path, which is a common evasion technique. \n\nAdditionally, there's a netsh command to enable the firewall, which might be an attempt to disable or modify firewall settings to allow further attacks. However, the command here is setting the state to on, which is normal, but the context of other activities makes it suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the use of procdump to dump lsass, the creation of a dump file in temp, and the combination with other commands like whoami and powershell suggest a potential security incident. This is likely a legitimate tool being misused for malicious purposes. Therefore, the batch is interesting and requires further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of procdump.exe and procdump64.exe executing with -ma lsass.exe to dump memory to disk, which is a common technique in credential extraction attacks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143926.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSON lines, all showing events where svchost.exe is setting registry values. The task is to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because attackers can inject malicious code into it. \n\nLooking at the events, all of them are the same: svchost.exe performing a registry value set. The \"Registry value set\" is a normal operation, but if it's happening repeatedly or in a suspicious context, it could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, all the entries are identical. There's no variation in the registry keys being modified, the process details, or any other parameters. That might indicate that these are just normal system operations, like updates or configuration changes. However, if there's a large number of such events, even if they're the same, it might be worth checking. \n\nBut in this case, the user provided 30 identical lines. That's a lot. Even if each is normal, the sheer volume might be unusual. However, without more context, like the time frame or other related events, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: the \"RegistryEvent\" rule might be part of a SIEM or monitoring system that triggers alerts on certain registry changes. If the rule is set to alert on any registry value set by svchost.exe, then this could be a false positive. But if the rule is more specific, maybe it's not. \n\nBut since all the events are the same, maybe they're part of a legitimate process, like a service starting up and setting its registry values. However, if this is happening repeatedly in a short period, it might be a sign of something malicious. \n\nBut the problem is that the data provided doesn't have timestamps or other details that could indicate if this is a one-time event or part of a larger pattern. The classification has to be based on the entire batch. \n\nGiven that all events are the same and there's no variation, maybe this is a normal operation. However, the high number of events (30) might still be concerning. But without more information, the confidence level is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is being monitored, and the rule is too broad, leading to many legitimate events. In that case, it's not interesting. But if the rule is supposed to catch malicious activity, then repeated events could be a problem. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any other context, like the presence of other suspicious events, I have to go with the given data. Since all events are the same and svchost.exe is a legitimate process, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. However, the repetition might still be a flag. \n\nWait, but the justification needs to be concise. If all events are identical and from a legitimate process, even if numerous, it might not be interesting. But if the number is unusually high, that's a different story. However, without knowing what's normal for the system, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn the absence of other indicators, I think the safest classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because svchost.exe is legitimate and the events are repetitive but not necessarily malicious. The confidence is around 0.6, as there's some ambiguity but no clear signs of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events are identical and involve svchost.exe performing legitimate registry value sets. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
