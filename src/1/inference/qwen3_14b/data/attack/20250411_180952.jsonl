{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe doing DNS queries, MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection, chrome.exe doing DNS and network connections. These seem normal. Browsers and system services often do that. But then there's a whoami.exe command, which is usually used to check the current user. Not too suspicious on its own, but maybe in context.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is common, but when combined with certain commands, it can be a red flag. Let me check the command lines. One of the cmd.exe entries has a command to add a user with a domain and a password. The command line is: net user \"pacote_principal_Admin\" \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" \/add \/domain & net group \"Domain Admins\" \"elemento_comum_Admin\" \/add \/domain. That looks like creating a new user and adding them to Domain Admins, which is a high-privilege group. That's a big red flag. Adding users to Domain Admins without proper authorization is a security risk.\n\nAnother cmd.exe entry has a similar command, adding another user. Also, there's a net1.exe which is probably a typo or a renamed net.exe. The presence of multiple user additions and group modifications suggests someone is trying to escalate privileges or set up access. \n\nLooking at the files created: winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which might be part of a log configuration. But the other files are just temporary logs. However, the main issue is the user and group modifications. \n\nAlso, the repeated use of powershell.exe with ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to manipulate processes or execute scripts. The Registry value set events could be part of configuring the system for persistence or changing settings. \n\nPutting it all together: the batch includes normal activities but also several suspicious commands related to adding users to Domain Admins, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these events points to a possible attempt to compromise the system. The confidence is high because creating domain admin users is a clear sign of privilege escalation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of domain admin users via 'net user' commands, repeated PowerShell and cmd.exe process access events, and potential privilege escalation attempts. These actions indicate possible unauthorized system modification.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. The first event is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is part of the System Resource Usage tracking, so that's normal. The second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a temporary YAML file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file there seems legitimate. The third and fourth events are powershell.exe interacting with the registry and process access. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but these events alone don't indicate malicious activity. There's no unusual file paths, no signs of exploitation, and the processes involved are typical. No suspicious behavior detected here. Confidence is medium because while there's no obvious threat, the presence of PowerShell activities could be a red herring. Overall, not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) performing normal operations (file creation, registry access).
