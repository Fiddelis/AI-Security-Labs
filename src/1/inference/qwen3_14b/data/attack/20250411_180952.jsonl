{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is svchost.exe creating a file in the System32\\sru directory. SRUtmp.log is a temporary file related to the System Resource Usage tracking, so that's probably legitimate. The second event is winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe it's just configuring itself, but the path is in the user's Downloads folder, which might be a red flag if it's not expected. The third and fourth events are about powershell.exe setting a registry value and having process access. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. \n\nNow, combining these: the first event is normal. The second could be part of a setup, but the third and fourth events involving PowerShell accessing the registry and processes might indicate something. However, without more context, like unusual registry changes or unexpected process access, it's hard to tell. The presence of multiple events from different processes, but none showing clear signs of malware or suspicious activity. The confidence here is moderate. Maybe the user is just installing software or configuring logs. Not enough to be certain, but not entirely innocent either. So, classification might be interesting with a confidence around 0.55.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving PowerShell and file creation, though some are legitimate (e.g., svchost.exe creating SRUtmp.log).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There's svchost.exe, which is a normal Windows process, so that's probably okay. Then there's MpDefenderCoreService.exe, which is part of Windows Defender, so that's also legitimate. Chrome.exe is a common browser, so normal activity there. But wait, there are multiple Network connection detected events for chrome.exe. That might be normal if the browser is accessing the internet, but maybe there's something else.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for scripting, which can be both legitimate and malicious. The cmd.exe entries have some commands that look suspicious. For example, one of them has \"net user\" commands adding users to the domain with passwords like \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adding them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag. Creating domain admin accounts with weak passwords is a clear sign of a potential attack. Also, the command line has \"\\\/add \\\/domain\" which is used for adding users to a domain, which is not typical in a normal user's activities.\n\nAnother cmd.exe entry has \"net group\" commands adding users to Domain Admins. That's even more concerning. Adding users to such a high-privilege group without proper authorization is a security risk. The presence of multiple \"net\" commands suggests someone is trying to manipulate user accounts and permissions on the domain.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a .winlogbeat.yml.new file and a pacote_base.txt. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be part of monitoring, but the other file's name doesn't indicate anything suspicious. However, the main issue is the user and group modifications.\n\nAlso, there are Registry value set events from cmd.exe and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware persistence or configuration changes. However, without more context, it's hard to say, but combined with the user account changes, it's a bad sign.\n\nThe processes like net.exe and net1.exe are being used to add users and groups. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" might be a typo or a renamed executable, which could indicate something malicious. Also, the command lines have domain-related operations, which are usually done by administrators, but if this is happening without proper authorization, it's a problem.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple suspicious commands in cmd.exe and powershell.exe related to adding users and groups to domain admin, which is a clear indicator of a potential security breach. The presence of these commands, along with registry changes and file creation, suggests that someone is trying to compromise the system. Therefore, this batch is interesting and needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) Creation of domain admin accounts with weak passwords via 'net user' and 'net group' commands in cmd.exe. 2) Unusual registry modifications by cmd.exe\/conhost.exe. 3) File creation in sensitive directories by svchost.exe. These patterns indicate potential privilege escalation and system compromise attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.92\n}"}
