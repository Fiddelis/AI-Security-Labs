{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first entry, there's a process with a command line that uses PowerShell to download a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is part of a repository named WinPwn, which I recognize as a known malicious tool. The command uses 'iex' which is Invoke-Expression, a common method for executing scripts in memory, which is often used in attacks to avoid leaving files on disk. The presence of 'sensitivefiles' might be a red herring, but the overall pattern here is classic PowerShell-based attack.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries with the task 'Execute a Remote Command'. That's a concerning task because it could indicate that an attacker is trying to run commands on the system remotely. However, the process field is 'None' for these entries, which might mean that the logs don't have process information for those events. But the repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' 15 times in a row is unusual. Even if some are false positives, that many instances could be part of a coordinated attack or a script that's trying to execute multiple commands.\n\nOther entries mention 'User Account Management' and 'Logon' tasks, which are normal system activities. However, the key here is the combination of the PowerShell command downloading a script from a known malicious source and the repeated remote command executions. Even though some entries don't have process details, the presence of the malicious PowerShell command alone is a strong indicator of potential compromise.\n\nThe confidence level should be high because the PowerShell command is a clear sign of a potential attack, and the multiple remote command executions could be part of the same attack vector. However, since some entries don't have process information, there's a slight uncertainty, but the overall pattern is strong enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands downloading a script from a known malicious GitHub repository (WinPwn) are detected, combined with repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' events, indicating potential adversarial activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location for PowerShell profiles, but creating a file there might be normal. However, the next entry shows another file created in the Temp directory with a name that looks like a script, and then it's deleted. That's a red flag because creating and deleting a temporary script could be part of an attack, like downloading a malicious script.\n\nLooking further, there's a process create event for powershell.exe with a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is raw.githubusercontent.com, which is common for hosting scripts, but the specific path here is from a repo named WinPwn. That name sounds suspicious, and the commit hash might be a specific malicious version. The command uses iex (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script, which is a common technique in PowerShell attacks.\n\nThen, there are multiple image loaded events for PowerShell loading various DLLs, including clr.dll and others related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but combined with the other events, it might indicate the execution of a malicious script.\n\nAlso, there's a registry value set by PowerShell, which could be modifying settings to persist access. The fact that the same process is accessing other processes and loading images might be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the download and execution of a script from a suspicious source, creation and deletion of a temporary file, and multiple registry and process access events. These are all indicators of potential malicious activity. The confidence is high because the combination of these events suggests an attack in progress, even though some individual events might be benign. But together, they form a pattern that's commonly seen in cyber attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL (WinPwn.ps1), creating\/deleting temporary files, and loading potentially malicious DLLs.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. The winlog tasks mention \"Image loaded\" for clrjit.dll and MpClient.dll. Wait, clrjit.dll is part of the .NET framework, so that's probably legitimate. But MpClient.dll is from Windows Defender. Maybe that's also normal, but I should note it. Then there's a file created in the user's AppData directory, which could be suspicious if it's not expected. \n\nNext, there's a registry value set event, but the file is None. Not sure about that yet. Then there's a bunch of entries with the same command line: powershell -exec bypass -e with some encoded string. The encoded command seems to be using IEX (Invoke-Expression) to download a script from a GitHub raw URL. The URL is from S3cur3Th1sSh1t's WinPwn repository. That's a red flag because downloading scripts from external sources, especially with -exec bypass, is a common attack technique. \n\nAlso, the same command line repeats multiple times, which might indicate a persistent attempt or a script that's being executed repeatedly. The presence of \"sensitivefiles -noninteractive -consoleoutput\" in the command line could be part of the malicious script's payload. \n\nThere are also entries with \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks, which might be related to the execution of the PowerShell script. The fact that multiple events have the same command line suggests that this is not a one-off event but part of a larger pattern. \n\nI should check if the GitHub URL is known for malicious activity. S3cur3Th1sSh1t is a username that I've heard before in some security contexts, but I need to confirm if that repo is legitimate. However, the presence of \"WinPwn.ps1\" in the URL makes me think it's a payload used in attacks. \n\nAlso, the use of -exec bypass is a clear indication that the attacker is trying to bypass execution policies, which is a common tactic. The combination of downloading a script from an external source and executing it with bypassed policies is a strong indicator of malicious activity. \n\nEven though some events are from legitimate processes like Windows Defender, the repeated PowerShell commands with the same malicious payload are concerning. The file created in the StartupProfileData could be part of setting up persistence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has multiple events pointing to PowerShell being used to download and execute a script from a suspicious source, which is a clear sign of a potential security incident. The confidence here is high because the indicators are very common in malware and attack scenarios.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute obfuscated commands to download and run a script from a GitHub repository (WinPwn.ps1), which is a known malicious payload.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143748.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of system log events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' entries. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. One of the cmd.exe processes has a command line that includes 'powershell -exec bypass -e' followed by some base64 encoded string. That looks like it's trying to execute a PowerShell script with bypassed execution policies, which is a red flag. The '-e' switch is used to pass an encoded command, so the script is obfuscated. That's often used in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, which is normal, but some of the loaded DLLs are from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Wait, the 'MpOAV.dll' and 'MpClient.dll' are part of Windows Defender, but I don't know if that's suspicious here. However, the fact that PowerShell is loading so many different DLLs might indicate it's doing something unusual.\n\nThere's a 'File created' event for a temporary script file '__PSScriptPolicyTest_rtdkaqiv.g0h.ps1' and then it's deleted. The name includes 'PSScriptPolicyTest', which might be related to PowerShell execution policy testing, but creating and deleting a file in the Temp directory could be part of a script execution. However, the presence of 'Test' in the filename might be benign, but combined with the encoded command, it's more suspicious.\n\nAlso, there's a 'whoami.exe' process, which is typically used to get user information. But when combined with other events, maybe it's part of a larger attack. The 'cmd.exe' process running a command that invokes PowerShell with bypassed execution policies is concerning.\n\nThe 'Pipe Created' event might be normal, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of inter-process communication for malicious purposes.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' events for 'cmd.exe' and 'wmiprvse.exe' might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms or other malicious configurations. However, without more context, it's hard to say, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it adds to the suspicion.\n\nNotepad.exe is a normal process, so that's probably not an issue. But the majority of the events involve PowerShell and related activities that are commonly seen in attacks. The use of encoded commands, creation and deletion of temporary files, and loading of various DLLs could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts or bypass security measures.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of encoded PowerShell commands, the creation of a temporary script file, and multiple image loads from various DLLs, especially those related to .NET and Windows Defender, might be indicative of a malicious activity. Even though some components are legitimate, the combination of these events suggests that further investigation is warranted. The confidence level is high because the encoded command and the file creation\/deletion are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with obfuscated commands (-exec bypass -e), creation and deletion of a temporary script file, and loading of .NET-related DLLs suggest potential malicious activity, such as script execution bypassing security policies.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
