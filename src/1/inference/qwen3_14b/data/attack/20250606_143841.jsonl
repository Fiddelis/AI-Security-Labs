{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines representing system events. My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries with \"powershell.exe\" being accessed or created. PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's used in certain ways, like executing scripts or accessing sensitive areas, it can be a red flag. There's a lot of \"Process accessed\" and \"Process Create\" events for PowerShell. That might indicate someone is running scripts or commands through PowerShell.\n\nLooking further, there's a \"whoami.exe\" process. That's a standard command to check user privileges, but if it's being used in a suspicious context, like after other malicious activities, it could be part of an attack. However, on its own, it's not necessarily bad.\n\nThen, there are several \"Image loaded\" events. The files loaded are mostly legitimate system DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, which PowerShell often uses. However, there's also a mention of \"MpOAV.dll\" from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe the presence here is normal.\n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1\" and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script file in Temp could be part of a script execution, which might be benign if it's part of a test. But if the script is malicious, that's a problem. However, the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which sounds like a test script. But maybe that's just a red herring.\n\nAnother thing is the \"Pipe Created\" event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but again, not inherently malicious. However, if there's a lot of them or in unusual contexts, it might be a concern.\n\nThe repeated access to PowerShell might indicate that someone is using it to execute commands. The \"Registry value set\" event could be part of changing settings, which might be benign or malicious depending on what's changed. However, there's no specific detail here.\n\nThe key points here are the multiple PowerShell activities, the creation and deletion of a script file, and the loading of various DLLs. While some of these are normal, the combination might suggest someone is trying to run scripts or perform actions that require elevated privileges. However, without more context like the actual commands executed or unusual network activity, it's a bit hard to say. But given that PowerShell is often used in attacks, and the script file creation, this might be worth investigating further. So the classification is probably \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe process creations and accesses, combined with file creation\/deletion in temporary directories and loading of .NET framework DLLs, suggest potential script execution or malicious activity.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, let's start by going through each entry.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries involving powershell.exe. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the tasks associated with them. There's \"Registry value set\", \"Process accessed\", \"Process Create\", \"Image loaded\", \"File created\", and \"File Delete logged\". \n\nLooking at the \"Image loaded\" events, the files loaded are all legitimate system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET and Windows Defender. That seems normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a file in Temp might be part of a script execution, but why is it being deleted? Maybe to avoid leaving traces. Also, the filename includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which could be related to PowerShell script execution policies. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated access to the same process and registry events. However, the presence of the temporary file creation and deletion might indicate some kind of script execution that's trying to be stealthy. Also, the command line for one of the processes is \"powershell.exe\" & {}, which seems like an empty command, but maybe that's a red herring or part of a larger payload.\n\nBut wait, there's also a \"whoami.exe\" process, which is a legitimate tool to check user context. However, combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a normal user action. However, the fact that there are multiple registry value sets and process accesses could be indicative of something trying to modify system settings or access other processes.\n\nI need to consider if this is a normal scenario or suspicious. The creation and deletion of the temporary file might be part of a script that's being run, but if it's a benign script, that's okay. However, the deletion could be an attempt to cover tracks. Also, the multiple Image Loads from .NET components might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's a bit suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the presence of \"File Delete logged\" which is a specific rule. Maybe the system is detecting that a file was deleted, which might be an indicator of an attack. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key points here are the temporary file creation and deletion, along with the multiple PowerShell activities. \n\nI think this is worth investigating because the combination of creating a temporary script file and then deleting it immediately, along with multiple PowerShell events, could indicate malicious activity. However, I can't be 100% certain without more data. So the confidence might be around 0.7.

There are multiple 'Process accessed' and 'Image loaded' events. The 'Image loaded' events include several .dll files, some of which are part of the .NET framework, which is normal. However, there's also a 'File created' and then 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary script file. That might be a sign of something trying to execute a script and then clean up after itself.\n\nWait, there's a specific command line in one of the 'Process Create' events for powershell.exe. The command checks if a file exists at a certain path and exits with 0 or 1. The path mentioned is 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe'. That path seems a bit suspicious. The '..' suggests moving up a directory, which might be an attempt to access a file in a parent directory, possibly to bypass restrictions.

These could all be signs of a potential security incident, like a script-based attack or malware trying to execute and cover its tracks.

That's a legitimate file, so maybe not suspicious. But the second event is a file created in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store stuff, but not always bad. \n\nThen there are several registry events and process accesses related to powershell.exe. Multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to manipulate the process. Then there's whoami.exe being run, which is normal for checking user context, but if it's part of a chain of commands, it could be part of a malicious script.\n\nThe standout event is the cmd.exe command to disable the firewall: \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". Disabling the firewall is a clear red flag. That's a common tactic by attackers to prevent detection. The fact that this command is executed suggests someone is trying to compromise the system.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry changes by svchost.exe. While svchost is a normal process, excessive registry modifications could indicate something's wrong, maybe a persistence mechanism or configuration change. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But combined with the firewall disable command, it's more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the firewall being turned off is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. All the entries are about svchost.exe triggering a Registry object added or deleted event. Now, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also a common vector for malware because it can host multiple services, some of which might be malicious.\n\nThe key here is that all the events are the same: svchost.exe and the same registry task. If this is a normal system activity, then it's not interesting. But if there's a pattern that suggests something unusual, like a high volume of these events or if they're associated with suspicious registry keys or processes, that would be a red flag.\n\nLooking at the data provided, there are 30 identical events. That's a lot. Normally, registry changes by svchost.exe might be normal, but having 30 of the same event in a short period could indicate that something is wrong. However, the problem is that the data doesn't include other details like the registry key paths, the user context, or other process information that might indicate malicious activity. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is benign or malicious.\n\nBut the sheer number of identical events might be a sign of a problem. Maybe a script or malware is repeatedly modifying the registry. However, since all the events are the same, it's also possible that this is a log collection issue or a normal system process that's being logged multiple times. \n\nSince the user is asking to consider the entire batch, and all events are the same, I need to decide if this repetition is suspicious. In many cases, a high volume of the same event could be a sign of an attack, but without more information, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that svchost.exe is a common target for malware, and the repetition, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. But maybe not. If the system is just logging normal activity, maybe it's not. But I don't have enough data. However, the fact that all events are the same and numerous might be worth investigating.

The majority of them are about svchost.exe triggering Registry events, like objects being added or deleted, and a registry value being set. Then there's a bunch of PowerShell commands creating a new PSDrive mapped to \\\\Target\\\\C$. \n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a normal Windows process that hosts various system services. But if it's doing a lot of registry changes, that might be suspicious. However, the same process is also involved in creating a PSDrive, which is a common PowerShell command to map a network drive. \n\nWait, the command line shows \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". That looks like someone is trying to map a network share, maybe to access files on a remote machine. But why would that be a problem? If it's part of a legitimate script, it's fine. But if it's unexpected, maybe it's part of a malicious activity, like trying to access a remote system's files.\n\nBut looking at the events, the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times. That could indicate an attempt to establish a persistent connection or to access a remote share repeatedly. Also, the fact that the command is using a UNC path (\\\\Target\\\\C$) suggests that the attacker might be trying to access a remote machine's C$ administrative share, which is usually not exposed unless the target is compromised.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any other suspicious activity. The other events are all related to svchost.exe and registry changes. But svchost.exe is a legitimate process, and registry changes can be part of normal system operations. Unless there's a pattern that's out of the ordinary, like a large number of changes in a short time or changes to specific keys that are known to be exploited.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the events are in a batch. If there are multiple events from svchost.exe related to registry modifications, but nothing else, it might not be enough to flag as suspicious. However, the repeated PowerShell commands creating the same PSDrive could be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to maintain access or execute commands remotely.\n\nBut I should also consider the context. If the system is a domain controller, mapping C$ might be normal. However, without more context, the repeated PowerShell commands and the registry events could be part of a larger attack. However, the classification here is whether the batch is interesting.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple PowerShell commands being executed. The first event has a command line that creates a new PSDrive with the name 'g' pointing to the Target's C$ share. That seems suspicious because creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share could be part of an attack, like trying to access files or execute commands on another system.\n\nThen there are a bunch of other events where the command line is just 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty block. Those might be normal or part of some automated process, but they don't look malicious on their own. However, the repetition of these empty commands might be a red flag, especially if they're part of a larger pattern.\n\nLooking further down, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific path. ProcDump is a legitimate tool, but it's also commonly used in attacks for dumping memory or extracting information from processes. The fact that the script is checking for procdump.exe in a path that seems to be navigating through directories (like ..\\registro_secundario) could indicate that the attacker is trying to locate or use this tool for malicious purposes.\n\nThe combination of creating a PSDrive to a remote machine and checking for the presence of procdump.exe suggests that there might be an attempt to access remote systems and use tools for data extraction. Even though some events are just empty commands, the presence of these specific PowerShell commands and the repetition could indicate a larger, coordinated activity. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that some of these might be part of a normal system's operation, especially if the tasks are related to lifecycle events. But the combination of these specific commands, especially the one creating a remote drive and checking for procdump.exe, leans towards being interesting for investigation.

The command line uses PowerShell to check if a file exists at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". If it exists, the process exits with 0, else 1.\n\nFirst, I notice that the file path has some suspicious elements. The path includes \"..\\\" which is a directory traversal, moving up from \"registro_comum\" to the parent directory, then into \"registro_secundario\". This might be an attempt to access a file in a different directory, possibly to check for the presence of a tool like procdump.exe, which is sometimes used for memory dumps.\n\nBut wait, why would someone check for procdump.exe? Well, procdump is a legitimate tool, but it's also commonly used by attackers to extract memory dumps from processes, which can be used to analyze malware or evade detection. The fact that the script is checking for this file's existence could be part of a larger malicious payload that's conditional on the presence of procdump.exe. However, in the given events, there's no actual execution of procdump.exe, just a check.\n\nThe winlog task is \"Engine Lifecycle\", which might be related to some automated process or service. However, the command line itself doesn't immediately indicate a malicious intent. The script is just checking for a file's existence. But the use of directory traversal in the path might be a red flag. Also, why is this check being done? Maybe the attacker is verifying if certain tools are present before proceeding with further actions.\n\nBut looking at the two events, they are identical. The same process command line is executed twice. This could be a benign check, like part of a script that runs periodically. However, the repetition might be suspicious. But without more context, like other events or the presence of actual malicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nThe classification here would depend on whether this behavior is considered suspicious. The check for procdump.exe and the directory traversal could be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for a more significant attack.
