So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, sppsvc.exe, powershell.exe, and others. Now, svchost.exe is a common system process, so that's normal. But HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Windows process. That's a red flag. Maybe it's malware?\n\nNext, the winlog tasks. There are Registry value sets and File created events. The File created events include paths like SoftwareDistribution\\Download, which is where Windows Update stores files. That's normal during updates. But there's also a file created in the user's AppData folder by PowerShell. That might be benign, like a startup script, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen, the Image loaded events point to urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate system DLLs, so loading them is normal. However, if they were loaded from unusual locations, that could be a problem. But the paths here are standard System32 directories, so that's okay.\n\nThe presence of HxTsr.exe is suspicious. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mindâ€”HxTsr.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. It might be part of some third-party software, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, combined with other events, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nAlso, multiple svchost.exe instances are creating files in the SoftwareDistribution folder. That's typical during Windows Update, but if there are a lot of unexpected files or if the process is not part of a known update, that's concerning. However, the metadata files mentioned (like UpdateAgent.dll, dpx.dll) are part of Windows Update components. So maybe that's just a regular update.\n\nBut the combination of HxTsr.exe performing a Registry value set and other normal processes might be part of a larger attack. However, without more events like network activity, unauthorized access, or other anomalies, it's hard to confirm. The justification here is that HxTsr.exe is an unusual process, but the rest of the events are normal system activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with svchost.exe. The first one is a registry value set, which might be normal. Then, files are created in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory. The file names include \"AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe\". That looks like a patch file, maybe part of an update. But why would svchost.exe be creating such a file? Normally, svchost.exe hosts system services, so maybe this is related to Windows Update. But I should check if this is a legitimate activity.\n\nNext, there are entries for MpSigStub.exe. This is part of Windows Defender, right? The tasks include image loaded, pipe created, and files created in the Temp directory with names like \"mpasdlta.vdm\" and \"mpavdlta.vdm\". These could be temporary files used during updates or scans. However, the presence of multiple files in Temp might be normal, but the combination with other events could be suspicious.\n\nThen, setup.exe is creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory, like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and elevated_tracing_service.exe. These might be part of an Edge update or installation. However, if these files are being created in unusual locations or by unexpected processes, that could be a red flag. But setup.exe is a common installer, so maybe it's legitimate.\n\nThe MsMpEng.exe entry is related to Windows Defender's real-time protection, loading an image from the Definition Updates folder. That seems normal.\n\nThere's also a RuntimeBroker.exe event with a registry value set. RuntimeBroker is part of UAC, so that's typical for managing permissions.\n\nThe powershell.exe event has a ProcessAccess task. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be exploited. However, without more context like script execution or suspicious commands, this alone might not be enough to flag it.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events seem related to Windows Update and Defender activities. The svchost.exe creating a patch file, MpSigStub.exe handling temporary files, and setup.exe installing Edge components could all be part of normal system operations. However, the combination of multiple file creations in Temp and the presence of delta patches might indicate an update process. But since all these are associated with legitimate system processes and known directories, it's likely benign. Unless there are anomalies like unexpected network activity or other malicious behaviors not mentioned here, these events don't seem suspicious. Therefore, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect standard Windows Update and Defender operations (svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe) with legitimate file paths and processes.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe with a ProcessAccess event. Not too bad, but PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Then there's whoami.exe, which is a normal command to check user identity. But then there's another PowerShell process with a command line that looks a bit odd. The command line includes importing a module from a path that seems suspicious: \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a red flag. Also, the script name \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" sounds generic and possibly malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are standard .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, which are normal. However, there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's interesting because those are part of antivirus software, but loading them might not be suspicious on its own. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoads could indicate the process is doing more than usual.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and subsequent FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and then deleting a file might be part of a cleanup process, but if the file is a script that was executed, that could be a sign of something malicious. The filename includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be a misleading name to avoid detection, but I'm not sure. Also, the fact that the script was created in the Temp directory is common, but combined with other events, it might be suspicious.\n\nThere's also a PipeCreated event, which could be normal, but sometimes used in malicious activities for inter-process communication. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: multiple PowerShell processes, accessing the registry, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting a temporary script. The command line in one of the PowerShell processes seems to be executing a script from a non-standard path with some obfuscation. The use of \"Invoke-entrada_principal\" (which might be a typo or obfuscated command name) and the error handling with exit code could be part of a malicious script trying to avoid detection.\n\nThe presence of \"Start-Sleep 5\" might be a delay to avoid detection or to allow some action to occur. Also, the path \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\" has \"unidade_logico\" which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese. Maybe that's a red herring, but the path structure seems a bit off.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's enough suspicious activity here to warrant further investigation. The combination of PowerShell executing a script from a non-standard path, loading multiple DLLs, and creating\/deleting a temporary file could indicate a malicious payload. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack yet, so it's a possible indicator of compromise rather than a confirmed threat. The confidence is moderate because while the events are suspicious, they could also be part of a legitimate process, but the combination does raise flags.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including executing obfuscated scripts from non-standard paths (e.g., 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'), loading potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll), and creating\/deleting temporary script files.

Let's start by going through each line.\n\nFirst, there are several entries where the process is 'tarefa_logico.exe' and the winlog task is 'Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)', with files pointing to various .dlls in the Windows System32 and .NET Framework directories. These seem normal because those are standard system files. But then I notice that the same process is loading multiple .dll files, which might be okay if it's a legitimate application, but maybe there's something suspicious here. However, without more context, it's hard to tell yet.\n\nNext, there's an entry with 'powershell.exe' creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's not unusual, but then there's a registry value set event. However, the next few lines have 'None' for process, winlog, and file, which might be placeholders or errors. Then, there are entries where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' pointing to a script file at 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. That path looks suspicious because 'unidade_logico' isn't a standard Windows directory. Also, executing remote commands could be a red flag.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries with the same command line for powershell.exe. The command line includes importing a module from that same suspicious path and running Invoke-entrada_principal with OutputDirectory set to $env:Temp. The use of $env:Temp is common in scripts, but the fact that it's importing a module from a non-standard location and using a catch block to exit with the exception's HResult might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or handle errors silently. Also, the repeated entries of the same command line might suggest that the process is being executed multiple times, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this together, the combination of loading system DLLs (which could be normal), but then executing PowerShell scripts from non-standard paths, using remote command execution, and the repetitive command lines might indicate a potential security threat. The presence of 'Execute a Remote Command' and the non-standard file paths are strong indicators of malicious activity.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to get the current user. That's normal, not suspicious. Then there are several powershell.exe processes. PowerShell is common, but the tasks associated with them might be important. \n\nLooking at the fourth event, there's a process create for powershell.exe with a command line that includes New-Service and Start-Service. The service is named \"objeto_ativo\" and points to a binary path that's not a standard Windows directory. The path is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That's unusual. Creating a new service and starting it could be a sign of malicious activity, especially if the binary is in a non-standard location.\n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs. Some of these are .NET framework DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might be a red flag. These are part of the antivirus, but if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, it could indicate something's wrong. But I need to check if that's part of normal operation or if it's being used maliciously.\n\nThere's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's common in some scripts to avoid leaving traces, which might be suspicious. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_on5b4n2z.iuj.ps1. The name includes \"ScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be a legitimate test, but combined with the other actions, it could be part of an attack.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it could be used for communication between processes. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe services.exe process has multiple Registry value set events. services.exe is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's modifying registry values, that could be part of a legitimate configuration change or a malicious attempt to persist. However, since there are multiple entries, maybe it's just a normal service update, but I need to check if the registry changes are suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a new service with a non-standard binary path, the use of PowerShell to perform these actions, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the loading of certain DLLs might indicate a potential security incident. The combination of these events suggests that an attacker might be trying to execute code, create persistence, or evade detection. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user gave me a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The instructions say to look at the entire batch as a whole, not individual events.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. The first event is a PowerShell command that imports a module from a specific path and then runs some commands. The path here is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". Wait, the '..' suggests moving up a directory, which might be a way to obfuscate the path. That's a red flag because attackers often use such techniques to hide the true location of malicious files.\n\nThen there are several entries where PowerShell is used to create a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\". Creating a new service is suspicious because legitimate software usually doesn't create services dynamically without user interaction. Also, the same command is repeated multiple times, which could indicate an attempt to persist the malicious activity or ensure it's running even if one instance is stopped.\n\nAnother thing is the file events. There are multiple entries where the file \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\" is being executed as part of a remote command. The task name \"Execute a Remote Command\" might indicate that the script is being run from a remote source, which is a common tactic in attacks. The repetition of these file events suggests that this script is being accessed frequently, possibly for ongoing malicious activities.\n\nLooking at the paths again, \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\\" seems to be a directory that's being referenced multiple times. The use of \"unidade_logico\" and \"registro\" (which translates to \"unit\" and \"registry\" in Portuguese) might be part of a naming convention that's either legitimate or could be obfuscation. However, the fact that the same file is being accessed repeatedly in these paths is concerning.\n\nAlso, the combination of creating a service and importing a module from a non-standard path could be part of a larger attack. The service might be a backdoor or a way to maintain persistence on the system. The presence of both the service creation and the execution of the script points to coordinated malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any benign explanations. Maybe the system is using these scripts as part of legitimate software, but the repetition and the paths don't seem typical. Also, the use of \"Start-Sleep 5\" in the first event might be a way to delay execution, which is sometimes used in attacks to avoid detection.\n\nConsidering all these points, the repeated creation of the same service, the execution of the same script from a suspicious path, and the obfuscation in the file paths all point towards potential malicious behavior.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them have the same structure. The process is \"None\" and the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", with the file path being 'C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. There are several repetitions of this exact same event. Then there are a few other entries with different tasks like 'Logon', 'Special Logon', 'Security Group Management', but those don't have any file paths associated. \n\nNow, the key point here is that the same event is logged multiple times. The file path is the same each time, and the task is always 'Execute a Remote Command'. Since PowerShell scripts (.ps1) are commonly used in attacks, especially for remote command execution, this could be a red flag. However, I should check if there's any indication of malicious activity beyond just the repetition. \n\nBut wait, the process is listed as \"None\" in most cases. That might mean that the event is being logged without a specific process, which could be unusual. Also, the same file is being referenced repeatedly. In a normal scenario, if a script is executed multiple times, maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but if it's the same file and same task over and over, that might indicate something like a loop or repeated attempts. \n\nHowever, there's no information about the success or failure of these commands, user context, or any other indicators like unusual network activity or privilege escalation. The other events with different tasks might be normal logon activities. But the repetition of the same command execution could be suspicious. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe this is a misconfiguration or a log error where the same event is being recorded multiple times.

The \"winlog\" field has a task called \"Execute a Remote Command,\" and the file path is always \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_secundario\\componente_auxiliar.ps1.\" There are 16 entries like that. Then there are a few others where the task is \"None\" or \"Windows Update Agent,\" but those don't seem as concerning.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files) are often used in malicious activities, especially when executing remote commands. Repeating the same file path multiple times could indicate an automated process or a script being run repeatedly. However, I should check if there's any variation in the logs that might suggest something else. All the entries with the same file path have the same task, which is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That repetition might be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility that this is a legitimate activity. Maybe the script is part of a scheduled task or a regular maintenance process. However, the fact that the same command is executed multiple times in a short period could be suspicious. Also, the file path is in a directory named \"registro_secundario,\" which translates to \"secondary registry\" in Portuguese. That might be a hint, but not definitive.\n\nAnother point is the presence of \"Windows Update Agent\" tasks. Those are normal, so they might be part of the system's regular updates. But the majority of the logs are about executing remote commands. The confidence here depends on whether the repetition and the specific task are typical. Since executing remote commands via PowerShell is a common attack vector, especially in cases like PowerShell Empire or other remote execution tools, this seems suspicious. \n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided timestamps, so I can't tell if these events are spread out over time or all clustered. If they're all in a short timeframe, that increases the likelihood of malicious intent. But without that info, I have to rely on the content. The same command being executed multiple times from the same file is a pattern that's often seen in attacks. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this batch is interesting because of the repeated execution of the same PowerShell script for remote commands, which is a common indicator of compromise.
