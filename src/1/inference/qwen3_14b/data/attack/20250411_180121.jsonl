{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180121.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're worth investigating.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. There are a lot of PowerShell.exe processes, which is common but sometimes used for malicious activities. Then there's cmd.exe and reg.exe being used to delete registry keys. The command lines show REG DELETE commands targeting the Run keys under HKCU. That's a red flag because modifying registry Run keys can be part of persistence mechanisms, like adding startup entries.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe & {}' which might be a placeholder or obfuscated command. The fact that there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' events with that command line could indicate something unusual. The ImageLoad event for mscoree.dll is normal, but maybe in context with other events, it's not suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes: conhost.exe and whoami.exe are legitimate, but when combined with PowerShell and registry modifications, it might be part of a larger attack. The repeated access to processes and registry changes could be an indicator of someone trying to modify system settings or execute commands.\n\nI need to check if there's a pattern. The deletion of registry keys followed by PowerShell activities might be an attempt to remove traces or set up persistence. The multiple ProcessAccess events for PowerShell could mean it's being manipulated or monitored. However, without more context like network activity or file changes, it's a bit hard. But the combination of registry edits and PowerShell usage is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because there are signs of registry manipulation and repeated PowerShell activity, which could indicate malicious behavior. The confidence is around 0.75 since it's not definitive but points to potential issues.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell and cmd.exe processes interacting with registry keys (especially Run keys under HKCU), combined with repeated ProcessAccess events and registry modifications, suggest potential malicious activity related to persistence or evasion techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The key here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are several PowerShell processes running with command lines that use WebClient.DownloadFile to download files from GitHub. The URLs all point to LICENSE.txt files from different repositories. That seems a bit odd because normally, LICENSE.txt is a standard file, but downloading multiple of them from different repos might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is using these downloads as a way to execute malicious code, but in this case, they're just downloading text files. However, the fact that there are so many such events could indicate something suspicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. A lot of themâ€”eight entries. That's a lot of registry changes from Chrome. While Chrome might legitimately change registry settings, having so many in a short period could be indicative of some automated process or even a malicious activity trying to modify the system.\n\nThen, there's a File created event for a PowerShell script in the user's Downloads folder. That might not be too bad, but combined with the other events, it could be part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlso, there's a Dns query event, but no process associated with it. That might be normal, but without a process, it's a bit unclear. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell downloads and the Chrome registry changes.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple PowerShell commands downloading files from GitHub, which is a common technique for downloading payloads. Even though the files are LICENSE.txt, which are usually benign, the repetition and the number of such events might be a sign of something malicious. The Chrome registry changes could be unrelated, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises suspicion. However, the confidence here isn't extremely high because the downloads are to text files, which are not inherently malicious. But the sheer number of events and the use of PowerShell for downloading could still be worth investigating. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing WebClient.DownloadFile commands to download LICENSE.txt files from GitHub repositories, which is unusual for standard license files and may indicate malicious payload delivery.

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file in the Downloads folder. That's common, maybe just a normal user activity. But then there's an entry about MpDefenderCoreService.exe having a network connection. That's part of Windows Defender, so maybe legitimate, but sometimes malware can mimic system processes.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating configuration files, that might be normal during setup. But then there are multiple entries of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying the registry. That's a red flag because PowerShell is often used in attacks for executing commands.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line in one of the entries: cmd.exe running SCHTASKS to delete a task named \"spawn\". Deleting a task could be part of removing a scheduled task that was used for malicious purposes. Also, the presence of whoami.exe is normal, but when combined with other actions, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThere's also an entry where schtasks.exe is being used with the \/Delete command. If the task \"spawn\" was created maliciously, deleting it might be an attempt to clean up. The repeated access of processes and registry changes by PowerShell could indicate someone trying to maintain persistence or alter system settings.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple instances of ProcessAccess events. If a process is being accessed repeatedly, that might be a sign of monitoring or tampering. The combination of file creation, registry changes, and network activity could point to an attacker trying to establish a foothold and cover their tracks.\n\nBut I should check if all these are legitimate. For example, winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file is part of its configuration. However, the use of PowerShell in such a way, along with the deletion of a scheduled task, might not be normal. Also, the presence of urlmon.dll being loaded by calc.exe and Calculator.exe might be benign, but if those processes are not expected, it could be a sign of something wrong.\n\nConsidering all these points, there's a mix of normal system activities and potentially suspicious actions.

But then there's powershell.exe involved. Let me check the powershell entries.\n\nOne of the processes has a command line that uses WebClient to download a file from a GitHub URL. The URLs are from different repositories, but they all end with LICENSE.txt. That's a common file, but downloading it via PowerShell might be normal. However, there are multiple instances of this, which could be a sign of something automated.\n\nLooking further, there are several ImageLoad events for PowerShell. The files loaded include .dlls from .NET Framework and Windows Defender. That's normal, but the presence of multiple image loads might indicate that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts, which is common but can be a vector for attacks.\n\nThen there's a FileCreate and FileDelete event for temporary files. The file is created and then deleted, which is typical in some scripts, but if it's part of a malicious activity, that might be a red flag. However, the file names here look like they could be part of a legitimate script testing.\n\nWait, the command line in one of the entries has a DownloadFile method. That's a classic PowerShell technique used in attacks to download malicious payloads. Even though the URLs here point to GitHub, which is a legitimate site, the fact that it's being used to download files and then immediately delete them might be suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple such downloads from different repositories could indicate that the user is trying to access various resources, possibly for testing or legitimate purposes, but it's worth checking if there's any unauthorized activity.\n\nBut wait, the user might be using PowerShell for legitimate tasks, like downloading scripts from GitHub. However, the combination of multiple downloads, image loads, and file creation\/deletion could be part of a larger process. Also, the use of $env:TEMP to store files is common but can be used by malware to hide files.\n\nAnother point is that there are multiple entries for Registry value set and ProcessAccess, which might indicate that the process is modifying system settings or accessing other processes, which could be a sign of malicious behavior.\n\nHowever, without more context, like the user's role or the environment, it's hard to say.

Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with processes like cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. The winlog tasks include Registry value set, Process accessed, Process Create, and Image loaded. The files mentioned are mostly system files like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. \n\nHmm, powershell.exe is appearing a lot here. That's common, but I need to check for suspicious activities. There's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file path is __PSScriptPolicyTest_xp2ayoai.hh4.ps1. Creating and deleting a temp file might be normal, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts. However, the name here seems like a test script, maybe related to PowerShell execution policy checks. \n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET assemblies. That's normal for PowerShell, but I should check if any of the loaded DLLs are unexpected. The ones listed are part of the .NET framework and Windows Defender, which seems legitimate. \n\nThe command_line for some entries is \"powershell.exe & {}\", which is a no-op. That might be part of testing or benign activity. However, the combination of creating a temp file, then deleting it, and multiple registry changes could be part of a larger attack. But without more context, like unusual commands or network activity, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry events and process accesses might indicate some level of system manipulation, but again, it's not conclusive. The fact that the user is using PowerShell and creating a temp script could be part of a legitimate process, like running a script that's then cleaned up. \n\nOverall, while there are some potentially suspicious activities, like temp file creation and deletion, and multiple registry changes, without additional indicators like network connections to malicious IPs, unusual command arguments, or persistence mechanisms, it's not strong enough to classify as definitely interesting. But it's on the edge. I'd say it's somewhat interesting but not highly suspicious. Maybe a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell instances with registry modifications, process access, and temporary file creation\/deletion.

The key here is to look at all the events together and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to 'powershell.exe' with various tasks. The first few events mention 'Image loaded' for files like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are all legitimate .NET Framework files, so that's probably normal. But then there's an entry where a file is created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_vuqecegr.2aw.ps1. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's odd. Why would a script be created and then deleted so quickly? It might be a sign of something trying to execute a script temporarily without leaving traces.\n\nLooking further, there's a 'Pipe Created' event, which isn't too suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'Registry value set' events involving PowerShell and other processes. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're part of a larger pattern, like modifying permissions or hiding processes, that's a red flag. However, in these logs, there's no specific detail about what registry keys were changed, so it's a bit hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the 'File created' event for a .yml.new file related to winlogbeat. That might be part of a legitimate configuration change, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe' processes are standard, but the command line for cmd.exe is cut off, which could be a sign of something being hidden.\n\nThe repetition of 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell might indicate that the process is being manipulated or monitored, but again, without more info, it's unclear. The main suspicious part is the temporary script creation and deletion. Attackers often use temporary files to execute malicious code and then clean up. However, the logs don't show any execution of the script, just its creation and deletion. It could be a false positive, like a legitimate process testing script policies.\n\nConsidering all this, the presence of the temporary script being created and deleted quickly is a potential indicator of malicious activity. However, since there's no direct evidence of execution or other malicious actions, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence level is moderate.

A lot of registry value set events and pipe created events. Now, Chrome and PowerShell are common, but the frequency of certain events might be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: several entries mention 'Registry value set' and 'Process accessed'. Also, there's a 'File created' event in the user's AppData directory. That's a common place for malware to store files. Then, there's an Image loaded event for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. But wait, the path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform... That seems legitimate, but maybe the fact that it's being loaded via PowerShell could be suspicious?\n\nAnother point is the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: \"Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\\objeto_principal.zip -ErrorAction Ignore\". This command is trying to delete a file named objeto_principal.zip in the temp directory. Why would someone do that? Maybe to clean up after an attack, which is a sign of malicious activity. Also, the use of -ErrorAction Ignore suggests they don't want any errors to be logged if the file isn't there, which is a tactic used by attackers to avoid detection.\n\nThen there's a 'Process Create' event for whoami.exe, which is a normal command to get user info, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a larger sequence. \n\nThe repeated 'Registry value set' events could indicate changes to the registry, possibly for persistence or altering system settings. The 'Pipe Created' events might be used for inter-process communication, which is normal but could be exploited by malware.\n\nHowever, some entries are normal, like Calculator.exe and Chrome.exe. But the combination of multiple PowerShell commands with suspicious file operations and registry changes raises a red flag. The presence of the 'Remove-Item' command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it's trying to delete a file, possibly evidence or a payload.\n\nI should also check if there are any known bad indicators. The MpClient.dll is a legitimate file, but the context here might be different. The key here is the combination of events: multiple PowerShell operations, file creation in AppData, deletion of a zip file, and registry changes. These could be part of a malware's behavior to install, execute, and then clean up.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch has several suspicious activities that, when combined, suggest potential malicious behavior.

These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But then there's an entry for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because MpOAV is part of Microsoft Defender's antimalware platform. Why would PowerShell be loading that? Maybe it's a red flag, but I need to check more.\n\nNext, there's a 'File created' event for a temporary PowerShell script file, then immediately a 'File Delete' event for the same file. That could be part of normal operations, like a script being executed and then cleaned up. But the fact that it's in the Temp directory and being deleted might be suspicious if it's part of a larger pattern.\n\nThen there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command lines that remove various .zip files from the Temp directory. The command lines use 'Remove-Item' with ErrorAction Ignore, which is a common technique in PowerShell scripts to delete files without causing errors. The repeated removal of multiple zip files might indicate that something is trying to clean up after itself, which is a common tactic in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the Chrome.exe events, they're loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's antimalware scanning interface, so that's normal. But again, the MpOAV.dll is loaded by Chrome, which might not be typical. However, since Chrome can interact with system components, maybe it's legitimate. But combined with the PowerShell activities, this could be a point of concern.\n\nThe key suspicious points here are the repeated file creation and deletion in the Temp directory by PowerShell, especially with the zip files. The use of 'Remove-Item' with ErrorAction Ignore suggests the script is designed to be stealthy. Additionally, the loading of Defender-related DLLs by PowerShell might be an attempt to bypass detection, as malware sometimes interacts with security software to avoid being flagged.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate script that's cleaning up temporary files.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a bit suspicious because PowerShell is often used for scripting, and creating files in startup locations could be part of persistence mechanisms. But maybe it's legitimate, like a user's own script.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events involving PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be part of malware trying to modify system settings. However, again, it could be a legitimate application doing its thing.\n\nNext, there's a Process accessed event for PowerShell, which might just be normal operations. But then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a standard tool for checking user identity. That's probably benign.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands to remove temporary files. The command lines use Remove-Item with paths in the TEMP directory. That might be part of cleaning up after some operations, but why so many times? Maybe part of a script that's being run repeatedly.\n\nThen there are Image loaded events for various DLLs, including some from .NET and Windows Defender. Loading clr.dll and mscoree.dll is normal for PowerShell when running .NET code. However, the presence of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could indicate that the system is actively scanning, but it's also possible that malware is trying to bypass detection.\n\nA file is created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to avoid leaving traces. The file name includes __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might be related to PowerShell script execution policies, but the deletion could be an attempt to hide the script.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event, which could be normal inter-process communication, but in some contexts, it might be used for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of creating and deleting files in temporary directories, multiple registry changes, and loading various DLLs might indicate suspicious activity. However, some of these actions could be part of legitimate processes. The key points are the repeated file operations and the use of PowerShell for tasks that could be part of an attack chain, like persistence or data exfiltration. The presence of Windows Defender's DLL might be a red herring, but the overall pattern of events is more indicative of something that needs further investigation.

The commands use Remove-Item with -Force and -ErrorAction Ignore. That's a bit suspicious because normally, you wouldn't just delete files like that without some context. But maybe these are temporary files that are no longer needed? However, the fact that there are several such commands might indicate something more.\n\nThen there's an entry about winlogbeat creating a new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal if someone is setting up logging. But not sure yet. Another entry shows PowerShell loading a DLL from Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but maybe not. Then there are a bunch of registry events, some from Chrome and others. Chrome having multiple registry value sets might be normal, but maybe not. \n\nWait, there's also a whoami.exe execution. Whoami is a standard command to get user info, so that's probably benign. However, the repeated PowerShell processes accessing other processes and creating files could be a red flag. The multiple attempts to delete files in TEMP might be part of cleaning up after some activity, but why so many times?\n\nAlso, the fact that there are several entries with \"Registry value set\" from Chrome and other processes could indicate some configuration changes. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell commands deleting files, along with other process activities, might suggest that someone is trying to remove evidence or perform some automated tasks. \n\nBut is this malicious? Maybe. The use of -ErrorAction Ignore could be to suppress any errors if the files don't exist, which is a common technique. However, the repetition of the same command multiple times might be part of a script that's running. Also, the presence of winlogbeat might be part of a legitimate monitoring setup, but if it's not expected, that could be a sign of something else.\n\nConsidering all that, the batch has several suspicious activities: multiple deletions in TEMP via PowerShell, numerous registry changes, and repeated process accesses.

The answer should be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about process access and creation, specifically for powershell.exe and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe is a legitimate command that displays user information, and it's being run multiple times. The powershell.exe is also common, but it's often used by attackers. However, just seeing these processes alone might not be suspicious.\n\nWait, there's one event that stands out. The 14th entry mentions winlogbeat.exe creating a file at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\\\data\\\\.winlogbeat.yml.new'. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting logs, but the file path seems to be in the Downloads directory. Also, the filename ends with .yml.new, which might indicate a temporary file. However, that's normal during installation or configuration. \n\nAnother entry (15th) shows powershell.exe creating a file named 'pacote_ativo.txt' in the same Downloads directory. Now, 'pacote_ativo.txt' translates to 'active package.txt' in Portuguese. The name is a bit generic, but without knowing the content, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that powershell is creating a file here could be normal or suspicious, depending on context. But there's no indication of malicious activity here yet.\n\nLooking at the frequency, there are multiple instances of ProcessAccess for powershell.exe, but that's common in many environments. The whoami.exe processes are also normal. However, the combination of multiple process accesses and the creation of files might be part of a larger pattern. But without more context, like unusual command-line arguments, network activity, or other suspicious events, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the justification should be concise. So, the key point here is that most events are normal, but the creation of 'pacote_ativo.txt' by powershell.exe might be a red flag. However, since there's no other evidence, maybe it's not enough. Alternatively, the presence of multiple ProcessAccess events could be normal if it's part of legitimate scripts.\n\nHmm. The confidence level would be lower here because there's not enough evidence of malicious activity. The only potentially suspicious thing is the file creation, but without knowing the content or other indicators, it's not conclusive. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the events don't show clear signs of an attack. However, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.
