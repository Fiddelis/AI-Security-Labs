{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry is about updater.exe from Google, which seems legitimate since it's part of Google's crash reporting. Then there's cmdkey.exe listing credentials, which is a normal command. Next, powershell.exe is accessed, but that's common. The fourth entry is a PowerShell command that runs several commands like net user, get-localuser, and lists credentials with cmdkey \/list. That's suspicious because it's gathering user info and credentials.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Security Group Management and User Account Management, which might indicate changes to permissions or user accounts. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll could be benign, but sometimes these can be exploited. The PowerShell creating a file in the user's AppData and setting registry values might be part of persistence mechanisms. \n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows a mix of normal processes and suspicious activities like credential dumping, user enumeration, and file\/registry modifications.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. The command lines in some entries include commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about users, groups, and stored credentials. That's suspicious because such commands could be part of enumerating the system for potential exploitation.\n\nThen there's an entry where winlogbeat.exe creates a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's normal, but creating a new config file might be part of setting up logging, which isn't necessarily bad. However, combined with other activities, it might be worth checking.\n\nAnother point is the execution of net.exe and net1.exe with the 'user' command. Net.exe is a standard Windows tool, but the presence of net1.exe could be a typo or a malicious replacement. However, the command line here is just 'user', which might be part of normal administrative tasks, but again, in combination with other events, it's a red flag.\n\nThe chrome.exe entries are all about registry value sets. If chrome is modifying registry values multiple times, that might be unusual. However, Chrome can legitimately modify its own settings, but repeated registry changes could indicate something else, like a browser hijacker or malware.\n\nThere's also an Image Load event for powershell.exe loading urlmon.dll and SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll. These are standard system DLLs, so that might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated use of PowerShell for system enumeration, combined with possible suspicious file creation and registry changes, might indicate a malicious actor trying to gather information or set up persistence. However, some of these events could be benign. But since the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times, that's a strong indicator of interest. The confidence might be around 0.75 because while some events are normal, the combination suggests potential reconnaissance activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands executing system enumeration techniques (user\/group listings, credential checks, file\/dir exploration) combined with suspicious file creation and registry modifications by Chrome.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple events related to chrome.exe performing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. But then I see several entries involving powershell.exe. \n\nLooking at the command line for one of the powershell.exe processes, it's running a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, ls C:\/Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system's users, groups, and network configurations. That seems like reconnaissance activity, which is often a sign of a potential security threat.\n\nThen there are events where powershell.exe is loading various DLLs, including some from the .NET Framework and Windows Defender. Loading .NET DLLs might be normal if PowerShell is running scripts that require them, but the presence of multiple image loads could be part of a larger malicious payload. \n\nAnother interesting point is the creation and subsequent deletion of a temporary script file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The file is named __PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1. The fact that it's created and then deleted might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving evidence, which is a common tactic in malware.\n\nAlso, the repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events for the same command line might indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's some logging happening, but combined with the other activities, it could be part of a larger operation.\n\nPutting this all together: the normal chrome.exe activities are probably benign. However, the powershell.exe activities, especially the command line with system reconnaissance commands, the loading of multiple DLLs, and the temporary script file, are red flags. These could indicate that an attacker is trying to gather information about the system, possibly to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network. The combination of these events suggests that further investigation is needed to determine if this is a legitimate activity or a security incident.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'd say around 0.8 because while some activities are normal, the combination of reconnaissance commands, multiple image loads, and temporary file creation\/deletion points towards suspicious behavior that warrants investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including system reconnaissance commands (net user, get-localgroup), loading of potentially malicious DLLs, and creation\/deletion of a temporary script file, indicating possible lateral movement or privilege escalation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each log entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, part of the Elastic stack, so maybe just a normal installation or configuration. Not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, SDXHelper.exe loaded urlmon.dll. SDXHelper isn't a standard Windows process; it might be part of some software, but I'm not sure. Loading urlmon.dll is normal for some applications, but I need to check if there's anything odd here.\n\nThen, powershell.exe created a file called modulo_base.txt. PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, but creating a text file isn't necessarily bad. However, depending on the context, it could be part of something malicious.\n\nThe MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process is running with a command line that includes \/ua and \/installsource scheduler. That might be a legitimate update, but sometimes attackers use similar names for malicious purposes. Need to check if this is part of a known update process.\n\nThere are two svchost.exe entries with registry value changes. svchost is a standard Windows process, but changes to the registry could be suspicious if they're modifying key settings. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe loaded taskschd.dll from SysWOW64. Taskschd.dll is related to Task Scheduler, which is normal, but again, the process name might be a red flag if it's not part of a legitimate update.\n\nBackgroundTaskHost.exe loaded urlmon.dll again. This process is associated with background tasks in Windows, so that's normal. But combining with other events, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at the powershell.exe entries again, one is modifying the registry. PowerShell interacting with the registry can be part of legitimate admin tasks, but also part of persistence mechanisms in malware.\n\nNow, putting it all together. There's a mix of legitimate processes (winlogbeat, svchost, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate) and some activities that could be benign or suspicious. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications by PowerShell and the loading of dlls by non-standard processes (like SDXHelper) might indicate something unusual. Also, the creation of a .yml.new file by winlogbeat could be part of a configuration change, but if that's not expected, it might be worth looking into.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the classification should be based on the entire batch. Are there any clear signs of malicious activity here? The events don't show obvious signs like unexpected network connections, privilege escalation, or known malicious files. The processes involved are mostly legitimate, and the actions are common system activities. However, the combination of PowerShell modifying the registry and the loading of dlls by non-standard processes might be a red flag. But without more context, like the source of the files or the nature of the registry changes, it's hard to be certain.\n\nConsidering the confidence level, I think it's on the lower side. The events are not clearly malicious, but there are enough anomalies that it's worth investigating further. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.5 or 0.6. The justification would be that while some events are normal, the combination of PowerShell registry changes and non-standard process activities raises suspicion.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities observed: PowerShell creating files and modifying registry, non-standard processes (SDXHelper.exe) loading system DLLs, and potential configuration file changes (.yml.new) which could indicate malicious behavior or system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
