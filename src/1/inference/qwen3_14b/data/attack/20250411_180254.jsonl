{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a single event in JSONL format. The event shows that chrome.exe is involved in a registry value set task. The winlog entry mentions a RegistryEvent rule. The file field is None, so no file was accessed here.\n\nHmm, I need to determine if this is interesting. Chrome.exe is a common browser, but it's also a frequent target for malware. However, just setting a registry value might be normal. For example, Chrome might update its own settings. But registry changes can also be part of malicious activities, like persistence mechanisms.\n\nWait, the classification depends on whether this is suspicious. Since there's only one event, it's hard to tell. Maybe if there were multiple such events or other related activities, but here it's isolated. The justification should mention that a single registry change by chrome.exe isn't enough to confirm malicious intent. But the presence of registry changes could be a red flag if other events are present. However, since this is the only event, it's not enough to classify as interesting. The confidence would be low because there's not enough context. So the classification is NOT INTERESTING, but I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the rule name \"RegistryEvent\" is part of a detection system. But without more data, it's hard to say. So the answer is NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A single registry modification event by chrome.exe is not sufficient to indicate malicious activity.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: chrome.exe doing a DNS query. That's normal, maybe browsing. Then powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry queries. Hmm, registry changes can be a red flag. The cmd.exe has a command line that includes systeminfo and reg query on the Disk Enum key. That might be checking disk information, which isn't necessarily bad, but combined with other events?\n\nLooking further, there's a systeminfo.exe process that loads amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If it's being loaded by systeminfo.exe, maybe that's normal? But sometimes malware can mimic legitimate processes. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so maybe okay.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe and calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is used for internet-related functions, but if these processes are legitimate, it's fine. However, if they're being used in an unusual way, that's suspicious. But again, the paths are standard.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is related to WMI, which is used by malware sometimes. The command line here includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be normal for WMI. The image loaded is wmiutils.dll, which is part of Windows, so that's probably okay.\n\nThere are multiple registry value set events by various processes like svchost.exe, cmd.exe, and others. Registry modifications can be part of normal operations, but if done in a short time frame or by unexpected processes, it could indicate compromise. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe svchost.exe is creating event logs (Parameters.evtx and State.evtx). Creating event logs might be part of normal system operations, but sometimes attackers create fake logs. However, the paths here are in the standard Windows directory, so that's likely legitimate.\n\nI also notice that there's a \"Special Logon\" event with no process name. That might be a user logging in, but without more info, it's hard to say if that's suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together: There are several registry modifications and process creations, but many of the processes involved are standard Windows utilities. The loaded DLLs are from legitimate paths. However, the combination of multiple registry changes, use of cmd and powershell, and the presence of WMI processes could be indicative of an investigation. But I'm not seeing clear signs of malicious activity. It's possible that this is just normal system behavior or a benign script. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications and the use of tools like PowerShell and CMD might be worth looking into further. The confidence here is moderate, maybe around 0.6. I'd say it's interesting enough to warrant further investigation but not definitively malicious.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: registry modifications by cmd\/powershell, process creation with systeminfo and reg queries, and unusual image loads (e.g., amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll). While some events may be benign, the combination suggests potential reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180254.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: winlogbeat.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. That seems normal. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its setup. Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's ApplicationFrameHost.exe and powershell.exe modifying registry values. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also common for legitimate scripts. Need to check if there's any unusual activity here. The registry changes alone might not be enough to flag it, but combined with other events?\n\nNext, powershell.exe accessing a process. That could be a red flag if it's accessing sensitive processes, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The event mentions \"Process accessed,\" but no details on which process. Maybe not enough yet.\n\nChrome.exe has several registry value set events. Chrome is a common target for malware, but again, registry changes could be part of normal operations like updates or extensions. However, the repetition of registry events might indicate something. Wait, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with Registry value set. But looking at the paths, some of them are loading DLLs like amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are part of Windows Defender and Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If chrome is loading those, maybe it's interacting with security software, which is normal. But why are they being loaded? Maybe not suspicious.\n\nWait, there's also a file created by powershell.exe at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_padrao.txt. Creating a text file might be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like exfiltrating data, that's bad. But with just this event, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the repetition of chrome.exe events. There are 14 entries for chrome.exe with registry value set. That's a lot. Could be a sign of something trying to modify many registry keys, which might be part of a persistence mechanism or configuration changes. However, without knowing the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point: winlogbeat is creating a .yml.new file. That's a configuration file, which is normal during setup. But if it's being done repeatedly or in an unusual location, maybe not. But the path seems standard for a download.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry modifications by different processes (powershell, chrome) might be a sign of someone trying to alter system settings. However, if all these are legitimate, then it's not an issue. But the high number of events could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the fact that chrome is involved in multiple registry changes could be a red flag. Chrome is a common vector for malware, but again, without knowing the specific changes, it's tricky. The justification here is that there's a high volume of registry events, especially from chrome and powershell, which are often used in attacks. However, the confidence might be moderate because some of these could be legitimate.\n\nBut wait, the first event is winlogbeat creating a file, which is normal. The other events are about registry changes and process access. The only file creation by powershell is a text file. Maybe not enough to be a clear threat. However, the repetition of events might indicate automated processes or scripts that are not standard. \n\nHmm. The confidence here is a bit low. The justification would be that there's a high number of registry modifications and process activities, but without more context on the specific registry keys or processes involved, it's hard to be certain. Maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because of the volume and the involvement of processes like powershell and chrome, which are sometimes used maliciously. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modification events involving chrome.exe and powershell.exe, which are often associated with malicious activity. The high frequency of registry changes (14 events) and process access attempts could indicate attempts to modify system behavior or establish persistence.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
