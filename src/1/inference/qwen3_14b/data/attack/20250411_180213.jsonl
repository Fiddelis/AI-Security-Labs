{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180213.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal behavior for a browser, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see powershell.exe being accessed a few times. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common legitimate tool. Need to check for any unusual commands.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry for whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user info. Not suspicious on its own. Then, there's a cmd.exe process with a long command line. Let me parse that. The command is copying sethc.exe to sethc_backup.exe, then taking ownership and changing permissions on sethc.exe, and copying cmd.exe to sethc.exe. Wait, that's the classic attack technique where an attacker replaces the System Settings Helper (sethc.exe) with cmd.exe, allowing them to gain access via Shift+NumLock. That's a clear sign of a malicious attempt to escalate privileges.\n\nNext, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe, which aligns with the command line in the previous event. Then, another event shows the same file being created again. Also, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file, which might be related to configuration changes, but not necessarily malicious unless there's unauthorized access. However, the main red flag here is the cmd.exe activity involving sethc.exe. \n\nOther events include registry changes and image loads, but the key point is the attempt to modify system files. Even though some events are normal (like chrome's network activity), the presence of that specific cmd.exe command line and file creation is highly suspicious. The confidence here would be high because that's a known attack vector. So the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.9.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch contains suspicious activity involving cmd.exe executing a command to replace the System Settings Helper (sethc.exe) with cmd.exe, a known technique for privilege escalation. This is corroborated by file creation events for 'sethc_backup.exe' and registry modifications, indicating potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180213.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's Calculator.exe, chrome.exe, sc.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. The winlog tasks are mostly Registry value set, Process Create, Image loaded, and Process accessed. \n\nHmm, the majority of events are related to chrome.exe performing registry value sets. That's a lot of chrome.exe entries. But is that normal? Well, Chrome might modify the registry for updates or settings, but multiple registry changes in a short time could be suspicious. However, alone, that might not be enough.\n\nThen there's sc.exe starting the wuauserv service. That's the Windows Update service. Starting it normally isn't bad, but maybe if it's done in an unusual context? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender's anti-malware scanning, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender. Loading these files might be normal, but if they're being loaded by chrome.exe, that could be odd. Wait, why would Chrome load Defender DLLs? That might indicate some kind of interaction or maybe a bypass attempt. But I need to check if that's common.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being run, which just outputs the current user's identity. That's a standard command, but if it's part of a larger sequence of commands, it could be part of a malicious workflow. However, alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nPowerShell being accessed multiple times. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. But without seeing the actual commands or more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nPutting it all together: The main points are the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, the loading of Defender DLLs by chrome.exe, and the use of sc.exe and whoami.exe. The loading of amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll by chrome.exe could be a red flag. Typically, these DLLs are used by Windows Defender, so if Chrome is loading them, maybe there's an attempt to interact with or bypass the antivirus. However, I'm not certain. But combined with the numerous registry modifications, this might indicate some form of malicious activity, like a browser-based exploit or a component trying to modify system settings. \n\nBut wait, maybe Chrome is doing legitimate things. For example, updating its own settings in the registry. However, the fact that it's loading Defender DLLs might be more suspicious. Also, the presence of sc.exe starting the update service could be part of a legitimate update process, but again, in combination with other events, it's hard to say.\n\nThe confidence here isn't extremely high because some of these events could be normal. However, the combination of chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times and loading security-related DLLs might be worth investigating. So I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe processes performing registry modifications and loading security-related DLLs (amsi.dll, MpOAV.dll) may indicate suspicious behavior, such as attempted evasion or interaction with security mechanisms. The presence of sc.exe starting the Windows Update service and whoami.exe execution adds context for potential system manipulation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
