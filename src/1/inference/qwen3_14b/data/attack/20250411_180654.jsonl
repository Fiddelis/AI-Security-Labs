{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to check for any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where PowerShell is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with different paths but the same script name and log path. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with malware trying to capture sensitive information.\n\nThe log path is set to $env:TEMP\\key.log, which is a common temporary directory. Malware often uses temporary files to avoid detection. Also, the fact that multiple different paths are used for the script might indicate that the attacker is trying to obfuscate the location of the malicious script.\n\nThere are also events related to file creation and deletion, like the temporary files being created and then deleted. That could be part of a larger attack where the malware is cleaning up after itself. The registry events and image loads might be part of the malware's persistence mechanism or attempts to evade detection.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any legitimate activity here. For example, PowerShell is a common tool for administrators, but the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with the same log path is suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple different paths for the same script might be an attempt to bypass security measures that look for specific paths.\n\nThe confidence level here is high because the pattern of using a keystroke logger script multiple times with varying paths is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Even though some events are normal (like Windows Defender loading DLLs), the overall pattern points to potential malware.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with varying paths but consistent log output to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about ProcessAccess and Registry value sets by chrome.exe. Chrome doing registry changes might be normal, but repeated entries could be a sign of something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is just using chrome normally.\n\nWait, there's a whoami.exe process. That's a legitimate command to check user identity, so that's probably okay. But then there's a powershell.exe command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes usually relate to keylogging, which is malicious. The log path is in the temporary directory, which is common for malware to hide files.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell scripts using .NET, but combined with the keystroke logging script, it's a red flag. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes executing scripts that capture keystrokes and the loading of various .NET components could indicate a malicious payload.\n\nAlso, the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is mentioned in different paths, which might be part of a larger attack. The fact that it's being executed multiple times and the involvement of PowerShell, which is often abused for malicious activities, adds to the suspicion.\n\nSo putting it all together: the keylog script, the multiple PowerShell events, and the loading of .NET DLLs all point towards a potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination here is concerning. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious scripts (e.g., 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1') aimed at capturing keystrokes and writing logs to temporary directories, combined with .NET DLL image loads, indicate potential keylogging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's go through each one.\n\nFirst event: svchost.exe created a file in the Windows Delivery Optimization directory. That path is under C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeliveryOptimization\\State\\keyValueLKG.dat. Wait, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process, part of the system's service host. The file it's creating is in the Delivery Optimization folder. Delivery Optimization is a feature in Windows that helps with updates and file sharing. So maybe this is a normal activity. But why is it creating a keyValueLKG.dat file? Maybe that's part of the system's normal operations. Not sure yet, but it could be benign.\n\nSecond event: winlogbeat.exe created a file in the user's Downloads directory. The file is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper from Elastic, used for collecting and sending logs. If someone is using Winlogbeat, it's possible that they're setting up the configuration. The .new extension suggests that this might be a temporary file during configuration setup. This could be normal, like a user installing or configuring Winlogbeat. However, if Winlogbeat isn't expected to be running on this system, that might be suspicious. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Could be legitimate.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe created a file called entrada_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool, and creating a text file isn't inherently suspicious. However, the name \"entrada_padrao.txt\" translates to \"default input.txt\" in Portuguese. Maybe the user is working with files in Portuguese, so that's normal. But if the file was created in a way that's unexpected, like through a script that's part of a malicious activity, that could be a red flag. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. The action itself is not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at all three together: The first event involves a system process creating a file in a system directory. The second is a log shipper creating a config file. The third is a user using PowerShell to create a text file. None of these events individually seem to be malicious. However, the first one might be a bit more concerning because svchost.exe is a common target for malware, but the file path seems legitimate. The other two are more likely to be user activities or legitimate software operations.\n\nBut since all three are separate and don't seem to be part of a sequence that indicates an attack (like multiple processes creating files in unusual locations, or access to sensitive areas), maybe they are not interesting. The justification would be that none of the events show signs of malicious activity. The confidence might be around 0.4, as there's no clear evidence of a threat, but the first event could be a red herring. However, I might be missing something. Alternatively, if the first event was a legitimate system file, then it's not suspicious. So overall, the classification is probably \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads, and temporary configuration files). No suspicious patterns, unusual paths, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
