{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not immediately suspicious, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nNext, there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Multiple times, the same event repeats. That might be normal if chrome is updating its settings, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get the current user, so that's probably just a legitimate process. But if it's part of a larger sequence of commands, it might be relevant.\n\nThe interesting part comes later. There's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves the log to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. Even though the file path isn't shown here, the presence of such a script is a red flag. \n\nAdditionally, there are multiple image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are part of the .NET framework, so loading them is normal. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context or from unexpected locations, that could be suspicious. But in this case, the paths seem to be standard system directories.\n\nAnother entry shows the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script being executed again, but with different paths. The fact that this script is being run multiple times, even if from different directories, suggests that it's being used to capture keystrokes repeatedly. That's a strong indicator of malicious intent, as keyloggers are often used to steal sensitive information.\n\nThe other events, like process access and registry value sets, might be part of the normal operation of the system or the legitimate use of the software. However, combined with the keylogging script, they contribute to a pattern that's worth investigating.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of the keylogging script is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. Even though some events are normal, the combination of these logs suggests that there's something worth looking into. The confidence level is high because keylogging is a clear sign of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in TEMP directory, indicating potential keylogging activity. This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, even though some events appear normal.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where PowerShell is executing a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The command lines all have similar structures, with the script path varying but the log path pointing to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That's a red flag because keystroke logging is typically associated with malicious activities like keyloggers. \n\nNow, the winlog entries mention tasks like Provider Lifecycle, Image loaded, File created, File Delete, Pipe Created, etc. Some of these are normal, like image loading or file creation, but the repeated use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different directories might indicate an attempt to evade detection by changing paths each time. \n\nAlso, there's an event where a process is None but the task is 'Execute a Remote Command', which might be a sign of unauthorized remote execution. However, the file path here is a .ps1 script in a common directory, which could be part of a legitimate script if not for the context of the other events. \n\nOther entries involve winlogbeat and svchost.exe creating files, which might be normal operations, but the presence of multiple PowerShell executions with the same script name across different paths is concerning. The fact that the same script is being run multiple times from different locations suggests a possible attempt to persist or spread the malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence here is high because keystroke logging is a clear indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with multiple executions and varying paths to avoid detection. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern points towards a potential security threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with varying paths but consistent log output to $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging behavior.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the batch as a whole to determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. The first event is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate system process, and DeliveryOptimization is part of Windows Update. The file path seems normal, so this might be a standard operation. Not suspicious here.\n\nThe second event involves winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipping tool, so creating a configuration file in the Downloads folder might be part of a user setting up the tool. However, the presence of a .new file could indicate a temporary file during configuration, which is normal. Not sure yet, but maybe not a red flag.\n\nThird event is powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate tasks, but creating files in Downloads could be part of normal user activity. Unless there's other context, like unusual commands or unexpected file names, this seems benign.\n\nNow, looking at all three together. None of the files are in system directories that are typically used by malware. The processes involved are all legitimate. The file names don't look malicious. There's no indication of unusual activity like multiple file creations in a short time, or access to sensitive areas. The confidence here is low because there's no suspicious behavior detected. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in non-system directories (DeliveryOptimization, Downloads) with standard filenames. No suspicious behavior or security indicators detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.15\n}"}
