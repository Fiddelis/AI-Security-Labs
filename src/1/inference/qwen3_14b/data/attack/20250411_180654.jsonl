{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. But then there's a lot of ProcessAccess and Registry value set events related to chrome.exe. Wait, chrome usually doesn't modify the registry much. Maybe that's normal, but repeated events could indicate something. However, there are a lot of them, which might be just noise.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so not necessarily bad. But then, looking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common malicious activity, like keyloggers. The script is being called multiple times from different paths, which might be an attempt to evade detection by changing the path each time. \n\nAlso, there are multiple ImageLoad events for .NET DLLs. That could be part of normal PowerShell operations, but combined with the keystroke logging script, it raises a red flag. The fact that the same script is referenced multiple times with different paths suggests it's part of a larger attack, maybe trying to collect keystrokes from the user. \n\nEven though there are some normal events like chrome modifying the registry, the presence of the keystroke logging script and the multiple executions of it from various paths is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The classification should be interesting because this behavior is typical of malware trying to capture sensitive information. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the keyloggers are a clear sign of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with different paths, attempting to log keystrokes to temporary files, indicating potential keylogging malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. There's a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed multiple times with the -LogPath parameter pointing to the TEMP directory. The name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" stands out because that sounds like it's capturing keystrokes, which is a classic sign of keylogging malware. \n\nNow, keyloggers are typically malicious, so that's a red flag. The fact that this script is being run multiple times from different paths (like C:\\modulo_padrao, C:\\elemento_base, etc.) might indicate that it's part of a larger attack or that the attacker is trying to ensure the script runs even if one path is blocked. \n\nAlso, there are events related to file creation and deletion in temporary directories. The creation of temporary files and then deleting them could be part of an attempt to hide the malicious activity. However, the deletion might also be normal cleanup, but combined with the keylogging script, it's more suspicious.\n\nAnother point is the registry value set events. While some registry changes are normal, if they're part of a larger attack, they might be used to persist the malware or modify system settings. However, in this batch, the registry events are a bit sparse, so maybe not the main issue here.\n\nThere's also an entry where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" with a file path that includes Get-Keystrokes.ps1. That might indicate that a remote command was executed, which could be part of a remote attack vector. But the process being None might be an error or a log artifact, so I need to consider that.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files is probably normal, as winlogbeat is a log shipper. The svchost.exe creating files in the DeliveryOptimization directory might be legitimate, but it's worth checking if those files are expected. However, without more context, it's hard to say, but the keylogging script seems more suspicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with log paths in temporary directories suggests that someone is trying to capture keystrokes, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. Even though some events might be normal, the combination of these PowerShell scripts and the keylogging behavior is enough to flag this as interesting for investigation. The confidence is high because keylogging is a clear sign of potential compromise.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple executions of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' via PowerShell with log paths in temporary directories suggest keystroke capture attempts, a common malicious behavior.
