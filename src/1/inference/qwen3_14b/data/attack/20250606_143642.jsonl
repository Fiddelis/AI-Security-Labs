All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for deploying and managing Windows images. The winlog entries mention \"File Executable Detected\" with the rule FileExecutableDetected. Each entry has a file path in the user's Temp directory, which is common for temporary files.\n\nNow, the key here is that Dism.exe is typically used in system imaging and deployment scenarios. The files mentioned have names like SysprepProvider.dll.mui, TransmogProvider.dll.mui, etc. These look like provider DLLs that might be part of the Windows Setup or Deployment process. The presence of multiple such files in the Temp directory might be part of a legitimate system preparation task, such as sysprep or image customization.\n\nHowever, the repeated detection of multiple executable files by Dism.exe could also be a red flag. Malware sometimes uses legitimate processes to execute malicious code. But in this case, all the files are in the Temp directory, which is a common place for both legitimate and malicious files. However, the fact that they're all being detected by Dism.exe and are provider DLLs makes me think they might be part of a legitimate system image preparation process.\n\nI should check if these files are known to be part of Windows. For example, SysprepProvider.dll is a known component used during sysprep, which is a standard tool for preparing Windows images. Similarly, other providers like ImagingProvider.dll might be part of the same process. So, this might be a legitimate activity, such as a user or administrator running sysprep or a similar task, which would involve these files.\n\nBut why are they being logged as \"File Executable Detected\"? Maybe the security system is flagging them because they're being executed from the Temp directory, which is often a place where malicious files are dropped. However, since the process is Dism.exe, which is trusted, and the files are part of a known deployment process, this might not be malicious.\n\nConsidering all that, the events might be part of a legitimate system deployment or imaging activity. However, the large number of files being detected could be unusual. But since they're all associated with Dism and known providers, I'm leaning towards this being a false positive or a legitimate process.

That seems suspicious because disabling security features like Defender could be a red flag. But maybe it's part of a legitimate system update or configuration change? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, powershell.exe is accessed. PowerShell is common, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. Then, Dism.exe is creating processes and files. The command line for Dism is the same as the first event, which is disabling Windows Defender. That's a key point. Disabling Defender is often a sign of malicious activity because it removes protection.\n\nLooking at the files being created in the Temp directory: AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, etc. These are all DLL files, which are normal in Windows, but when they're being created in the Temp folder, that's unusual. Legitimate DLLs are usually in system directories, not Temp. Also, the fact that multiple executable files are detected in Temp might indicate that something is trying to execute malicious code or droppers.\n\nThe user is 'fiddelis'â€”maybe a typo or a specific user account. The path is in AppData\\Local\\Temp, which is a common place for malware to store temporary files. The repeated File Executable Detected events for Dism.exe and the creation of multiple DLLs and executables in Temp suggest that this might be part of a larger operation. \n\nPutting it all together: Disabling Windows Defender via Dism, followed by creating numerous executable files in Temp. This pattern is often seen in malware installations where the attacker disables security software and then deploys malicious components. Even though some of these files could be legitimate, the combination of disabling Defender and the volume of files in Temp raises suspicion. \n\nI need to check if there's any indication that these files are legitimate. For example, if they were signed by Microsoft, but the logs don't mention that. Also, the use of Dism to disable features is a legitimate command, but the context here is suspicious. The fact that so many files are being created and detected as executable in Temp is a strong indicator of something wrong. \n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because the events suggest an attempt to disable security features and deploy potential malicious files.

So the user provided a bunch of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to parse through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first entry: powershell.exe has a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't inherently malicious, but it's something to note. Then there's an Image Loaded event for clrjit.dll, which is part of the .NET runtime. That's normal, but maybe if it's loaded in an unusual context, it could be a red flag. Then another Process Accessed event, but no file info. \n\nNext, there's another Image Load for MpClient.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems legitimate, but again, depends on the context. Then there's a whoami.exe process created, which is a standard tool for checking user identity. Not suspicious on its own. \n\nLooking further, there's a PowerShell command that's checking INF files for certain patterns. The command line is a bit complex, but it's just scanning for defaultinstall sections in INF files. Maybe part of a script that's looking for drivers or something. Not sure yet. \n\nThen several Image Load events for various .NET DLLs and Windows Defender components. These are all legitimate files, so that's normal. But there's also a File Created event in the Temp directory with a .psm1 file. PowerShell modules can be used for both good and bad purposes. If this module is being created by PowerShell, it might be part of a script, but depending on the content, it could be malicious. \n\nAnother Pipe Created event and more Image Loads. The repeated Image Loads might be normal if PowerShell is running a script that requires those DLLs. However, the presence of multiple events related to the same process might indicate something. \n\nWait, the command line in one of the PowerShell processes is using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted. That's a security feature to prevent running scripts unless they're signed or allowed. But if the script is being run despite that, maybe there's an attempt to bypass policies. However, the command itself is just checking INF files, which might be part of a legitimate process. \n\nThe File Created event in the Temp folder could be a sign of something, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Maybe the script is generating a module file temporarily. However, the fact that there are multiple Image Loads from .NET and Defender components might be normal for PowerShell scripts. \n\nPutting it all together: there's a lot of PowerShell activity, which is common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios. The presence of multiple Image Loads and Pipe events could be part of normal operations, but the combination might be worth investigating. The File Created in Temp might be a red flag, but without knowing the content, it's hard to say. The whoami.exe is standard. \n\nHmm, but I don't see any obvious signs of malicious activity. The events are all related to legitimate processes and files. Unless there's something I'm missing. Maybe the repeated Image Loads are normal for PowerShell scripts. The only possible suspicious thing is the Temp file creation, but that's not enough to classify it as interesting. \n\nWait, but the user is asking to consider the entire batch. The fact that there are multiple events related to PowerShell, including loading various DLLs and creating files, might be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without more context like unexpected network connections, unusual process trees, or other anomalies, it's hard to be certain. \n\nConsidering the confidence level, I'm not 100% sure, but there's enough activity that could be indicative of something. Maybe the justification is that there's a high volume of PowerShell-related events, which could be a sign of an attack, but the confidence is moderate. Alternatively, if all the events are legitimate, then it's not interesting. \n\nI think I need to check if any of these files are known malicious. The files mentioned are all standard system files or Defender components. The Temp file is a generated module, which could be part of a script. Since the user is a cybersecurity expert, they might be looking for patterns that could be part of an attack. \n\nIn the absence of clear malicious indicators, but considering the high number of PowerShell events, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. However, it's possible that this is just a normal script execution. The justification would be the elevated PowerShell activity and potential script execution, but without more evidence, it's a bit ambiguous.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events including file creation in Temp directory, repeated image loading of .NET and Defender components, and potential script execution with -ExecutionPolicy Restricted may indicate suspicious activity warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}

Or is there a possibility that an attacker is using Dism.exe to delete files, maybe to hide malicious activities?

After that, Dism.exe is deleting several of the DLL files that were previously loaded. The files being deleted are AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, DismCore.dll, and others. The deletion is logged under the FileDeleteDetected rule. \n\nNow, considering the normal behavior, DISM tools are used for managing Windows images, and they often load various providers during operations like applying updates or configurations.

Also, the use of wildcards in the file name could mean they're trying to delete multiple files, which might be part of a malware cleanup or hiding evidence.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks, some are 'Provider Lifecycle' and others 'Engine Lifecycle'. Not sure what that refers to exactly, but it might be related to the system's logging or some service. However, the key thing here is the combination of scanning INF files and then mass deleting zip files. That doesn't seem to align with normal user behavior. It's possible that the initial scan is checking for system configurations that could be exploited, and then the deletions are part of removing evidence or payloads.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same command is repeated multiple times. The PowerShell script is executed several times, which might indicate that the process is being run repeatedly, possibly to ensure that the action is carried out or to check for changes. The high number of events could also be an attempt to overwhelm the system or to make detection harder by spreading the activity over time.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The commands themselves aren't obviously harmful. The first script is just reading INF files, which are part of Windows setup, and the deletions are just removing zip files. But the combination and the repetition are suspicious. The confidence isn't 100%, but there's enough to warrant further investigation. So, I think classifying this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7 makes sense because while the individual commands aren't clearly malicious, their combination and frequency suggest potential malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated PowerShell commands scanning INF files for architecture-specific sections and mass deletion of zip files in Temp directory, suggesting potential system reconnaissance or cleanup of malicious payloads.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143642.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and they probably want me to analyze them for any suspicious activity. Let me start by going through each entry one by one.\n\nFirst, I see entries related to processes like services.exe, sppsvc.exe, svchost.exe, and several instances of powershell.exe. The winlog entries mention tasks like Process Create, Registry value set, Image loaded, Process accessed, and File created\/deleted. \n\nStarting with the first entry: services.exe with a Registry value set. That's a normal system process, so maybe not suspicious. Then sppsvc.exe (which is related to the Software Protection Platform) also doing a Registry value set. That seems okay too. \n\nNext, svchost.exe with a Registry value set. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so that's normal. But I should check if there are any unusual registry changes here, but the log doesn't specify which keys were modified. \n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe entries. The first one is a Process Create, which is normal. But then there's a command line that tries to remove a file named *entrada_principal.zip from the Temp directory. That's interesting because deleting a zip file might be part of a cleanup, but the fact that it's using a wildcard (*) could be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to delete all files matching that pattern, which could be part of hiding evidence or removing malicious files.\n\nLooking at the File created entry: a PowerShell script is created in the Temp directory. Then immediately after, that same file is deleted. That's suspicious because creating and then deleting a file quickly might be an attempt to avoid detection. The script's name is something like __PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1. The \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" part might be a red herring, but the fact that it's in the Temp directory and deleted quickly is concerning.\n\nAlso, the Image loaded entries for powershell.exe show several DLLs being loaded, including mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET. That's normal for PowerShell, but maybe the presence of Defender's MpOAV.dll could be relevant. However, that's part of Windows Defender, so it's probably legitimate.\n\nAnother thing to note is the command line for the powershell.exe that deletes the zip file. The use of Remove-Item with the -Force parameter might indicate that the user is trying to ensure the file is deleted even if it's read-only or locked. The path is in the Temp directory, which is a common place for temporary files, but the deletion of a zip file could be part of an attack chain where the zip was extracted earlier, and now they're cleaning up.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes that might be involved. The initial processes like services.exe and svchost.exe are system processes, so they're not the issue. The suspicious activity is centered around the PowerShell commands and the file operations in the Temp directory.\n\nIs there any other red flags? The repeated use of Process accessed and Image loaded might be normal for PowerShell, but if there's an unusual number of these events, it could be a sign of something. However, the logs provided don't give the count, so I can't say for sure.\n\nIn summary, the main suspicious activities are:\n1. The PowerShell command attempting to delete all files matching *entrada_principal.zip in the Temp directory.\n2. The creation and immediate deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory, which might be an attempt to execute malicious code without leaving evidence.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that the user is running a legitimate script that's just cleaning up files, but the use of a wildcard and the quick deletion might be indicative of malicious intent. The presence of the script in the Temp directory is common for both legitimate and malicious activities, but combined with the deletion, it's more suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries provided indicate a sequence of system activities, with several potentially suspicious actions centered around **PowerShell** and **file operations**. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. PowerShell Activity and File Deletion**\n- **Command Line Execution**:\n  - A PowerShell process executed the command:  \n    ```powershell\n    Remove-Item $env:Temp\\\\*entrada_principal.zip -Force\n    ```\n  - **Suspicious Behavior**:\n    - **Wildcard Deletion**: Using `*entrada_principal.zip` to delete **all** files matching that pattern in the Temp directory could indicate an attempt to **clean up evidence** (e.g., malicious ZIP files or logs) or **remove files associated with a specific activity**.\n    - **-Force Parameter**: Ensures deletion even if files are locked or read-only, which is often used in malicious scripts to avoid errors.\n\n- **File Creation and Deletion**:\n  - A PowerShell script (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1`) was **created** in the Temp directory and **immediately deleted**.\n  - **Why This is Suspicious**:\n    - **Ephemeral Files**: Creating and deleting a file quickly may be an attempt to **avoid detection** by security tools or logs.\n    - **Temp Directory**: Commonly used by both legitimate and malicious scripts for temporary storage, but combined with deletion, it raises red flags.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Image Load Events**\n- **PowerShell DLLs Loaded**:\n  - PowerShell loaded .NET-related DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `System.Management.Automation.ni.dll`).\n  - **Legitimate Context**: These are standard components for PowerShell execution, but their presence is **not inherently malicious**.\n\n- **Windows Defender DLL**:\n  - `MpOAV.dll` (part of Windows Defender) was loaded. This is **normal** and likely unrelated to malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Registry and Process Events**\n- **Registry Modifications**:\n  - Processes like `services.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` triggered **Registry value set** events.\n  - **Context**: These are system processes, and Registry changes are common for legitimate operations (e.g., service configuration). No specific malicious keys are mentioned.\n\n- **Process Access**:\n  - Multiple **Process accessed** events for `powershell.exe` suggest monitoring or interaction with the process, but **no direct evidence of compromise** is present.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual File Operations**:\n  - Deletion of files with a wildcard (`*entrada_principal.zip`) could indicate **cleanup of malicious payloads** or **removal of logs**.\n- **Ephemeral Script in Temp Directory**:\n  - The creation and deletion of a script named `__PSScriptPolicyTest_rxszx2r5.rk2.ps1` may be an attempt to **execute a script without leaving traces**.\n- **Lack of Context**:\n  - The logs do not provide details about the script's contents or the source of the ZIP file, making it harder to determine intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Investigate the ZIP File**:\n   - Check if `*entrada_principal.zip` was present in the Temp directory before deletion. If found, analyze its contents for malicious payloads.\n2. **Monitor PowerShell Scripts**:\n   - Review PowerShell execution logs for other scripts in the Temp directory or unusual command-line arguments.\n3. **Check for Persistence**:\n   - Investigate if the PowerShell process was initiated by a scheduled task, registry key, or other persistence mechanisms.\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for additional events (e.g., network connections, file creation, or process spawning) around the time of the deletion to build a timeline.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the log entries do not confirm a breach, the **wildcard file deletion** and **ephemeral script in the Temp directory** are **highly suspicious** and warrant further investigation. These actions are commonly associated with **malicious cleanup or evasion techniques**."}
