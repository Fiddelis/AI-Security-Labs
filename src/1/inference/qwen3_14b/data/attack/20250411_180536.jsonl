{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of Chrome processes doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's PowerShell being accessed multiple times. That could be normal, but sometimes it's used for malicious activities. \n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes sc.exe create and start commands. SC.exe is used to manage Windows services. The command line here is creating a service called 'elemento_principal' pointing to an executable path, and then starting another service. That seems suspicious because creating a new service might be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. \n\nAlso, there are multiple Registry value set events for services.exe and sc.exe. Changing registry values could be an indicator of malicious activity, like modifying system settings to hide the malware or change behavior. \n\nThen there's the image loaded events for mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clr.dll. These are .NET runtime components. Loading them might be normal if the application is .NET-based, but if they're being loaded from unexpected paths or in unusual contexts, that could be a red flag. However, the paths here are standard Windows directories, so maybe that's okay. \n\nPutting it all together: The Chrome activity seems benign. The PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, especially the use of sc.exe to create services, along with registry modifications, are more concerning. The image loads are in standard locations but could be part of legitimate .NET apps. However, the combination of creating services and modifying the registry without clear justification might indicate an attempt to establish persistence. \n\nI should check if the services created are legitimate. The names like 'elemento_principal' and 'modulo_comum' don't ring a bell as standard services. Also, the command line for sc.exe includes paths that might be obfuscated or part of a larger malicious payload. \n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be normal, but the combination of service creation, registry changes, and multiple PowerShell accesses increases the suspicion. So, classifying this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.7 or 0.8 seems reasonable.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of new services via sc.exe with non-standard names, registry modifications by services.exe, and frequent PowerShell\/process access events that may indicate persistence mechanisms or lateral movement. The combination of these events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180536.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's tarefa_logico.exe, estrutura_principal.exe, modulo_secundario.exe, and elemento_ativo.exe. These names don't ring any bells as standard Windows processes. They sound more like custom or possibly malicious names. Then there's a bunch of other processes like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, which are common, but when combined with others, might indicate something.\n\nThe winlog events include Image loaded and Registry value set. The ImageLoad events point to files in standard locations like C:\\Windows\\assembly and C:\\Windows\\System32, which are normal for legitimate processes. However, the RegistryEvent tasks are a bit more concerning. Multiple processes setting registry values could be part of normal operations, but if done in a short time or by non-standard processes, it might be a red flag.\n\nWait, there's also winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the user's Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, but the filename .winlogbeat.yml.new might be part of a configuration setup. However, the same entry appears twice, which might be a duplication error or just repeated logging. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the processes again, the presence of multiple custom-named .exe files (tarefa_logico, estrutura_principal, modulo_secundario, elemento_ativo) could be suspicious. These might be part of a malicious payload or a legitimate application with non-standard naming. But since they're not common, it's worth noting.\n\nAlso, the fact that several processes are accessing the registry might indicate attempts to modify system settings or hide their presence. However, without more context like the specific registry keys changed or unusual behavior, it's hard to say. But combined with the custom processes, it might be a sign of something malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The events don't show any obvious malicious activities like file deletions, network connections to suspicious IPs, or execution of unknown scripts. The ImageLoad events are pointing to legitimate system DLLs. The registry changes are not specified in detail, so it's hard to tell if they're harmful.\n\nBut the combination of multiple custom processes and registry modifications could be interesting enough for further investigation. The confidence here is moderate. Maybe around 0.6. It's not a clear-cut malicious activity, but there are enough anomalies to warrant a closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple non-standard processes (e.g., 'tarefa_logico.exe', 'modulo_secundario.exe') are involved in image loading and registry modifications, which may indicate unauthorized activity.
