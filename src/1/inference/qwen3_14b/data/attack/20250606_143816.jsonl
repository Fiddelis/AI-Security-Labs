{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event shows a PowerShell command creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because mounting a remote drive, especially with the filesystem provider, could be part of an attack. The command line is using PowerShell, which is common for both legitimate and malicious activities.\n\nThen there are 20 subsequent events, all with the task 'Execute a Remote Command'. Most of them have 'process' and 'file' as None, which might mean the logs are incomplete or the data wasn't captured properly. However, the repetition of 'Execute a Remote Command' multiple times in a short period could indicate automated or repeated attempts to execute commands remotely. \n\nThe first event's PowerShell command might be part of establishing access, and the following remote command executions could be part of a broader attack. Even though some entries lack process or file details, the combination of the initial suspicious command and the repeated remote executions raises a red flag. It's possible that the attacker is trying to maintain access or execute payloads. However, without more context, like the source IP, user context, or other indicators, it's a bit hard to be certain.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: svchost.exe and a registry value set. That's normal, svchost is a common process. Then sppsvc.exe creating a file in the System32\\spp\\store directory. That seems okay too, maybe related to software protection service.\n\nNext, there's a lot of activity from powershell.exe. Multiple events of process access, image loaded, file created, and deleted. The command line in one of them is creating a new PSDrive pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That looks suspicious because accessing another machine's C$ share could be part of lateral movement. Also, there are several image loads from .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, etc. Those are normal for PowerShell, but the combination with other events might indicate something.\n\nThe file creation and deletion in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1. The name seems generic, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly could be a sign of a temporary script being used. Also, the Pipe Created event might be part of inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad but could be used by malware.\n\nLooking at the registry events, there's a Registry value set by PowerShell. That could be modifying policies or settings, which might be legitimate but could also be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from PowerShell with various operations. The creation of a network drive to a remote machine's C$ share is a red flag. The loading of .NET assemblies is normal, but combined with file operations and registry changes, it might indicate an attacker using PowerShell for malicious activities. The fact that a script is created and then deleted could be an attempt to hide its presence. However, without more context like the actual content of the script or other indicators, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the events, there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. So the classification should be INTERESTING with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes exhibit suspicious behavior, including creating network drives to remote machines (e.g., \\\\Target\\\\C$), loading .NET assemblies, and creating\/deleting temporary scripts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. The main thing here is to look for any signs of malicious activity. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the events. There's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious purposes. Let me check the command lines. One entry has a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is \"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\". Wait, the username here is \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" which looks suspicious. Also, the script name is WinPwn.ps1. That doesn't sound right. Usually, legitimate scripts wouldn't have names like that. \n\nThen there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell.exe, loading various DLLs. Some of them are .NET related, which is normal for PowerShell, but others like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll are related to Windows Defender. Maybe that's part of the script's operation, but could also be a red flag if it's trying to disable or interact with the antivirus.\n\nThere's also a File Created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic for malware to execute something temporarily and then clean up. The file name is __PSScriptPolicyTest_... which might be a way to bypass execution policies, but the deletion is suspicious.\n\nThe Registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration, possibly to persist after reboot or alter settings. \n\nAnother thing is the repeated access to PowerShell.exe processes. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, the combination of downloading scripts, loading unusual DLLs, and creating\/deleting files could indicate a malicious payload being executed.\n\nI should also check if there are any other processes involved. There's a sppsvc.exe which is a legitimate service, but the Image Load for taskschd.dll is normal. However, if the script is using Task Scheduler, that could be part of the attack.\n\nPutting it all together: the presence of a PowerShell script downloading from a suspicious GitHub repo, loading potentially malicious DLLs, creating and deleting temporary files, and modifying the registry all point towards a possible security incident. The confidence here would be high because multiple suspicious activities are present in the logs.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events include a command line downloading a script from a suspicious GitHub URL (S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn), loading potentially malicious DLLs (e.g., MpOAV.dll), and creating\/deleting temporary files, which are common indicators of malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry has \"process\": \"None\" and \"winlog\": \"{'task': 'None'}\", which might be a placeholder or an error. But the rest of the entries are more interesting.\n\nLooking at the process command lines, there's a repeated pattern: powershell.exe executing a command that downloads a PowerShell script from a GitHub URL. The URL is https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/S3cur3Th1sSh1t\/WinPwn\/...\/WinPwn.ps1. That seems suspicious because downloading scripts from external sources, especially with \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" in the username, which might be a red flag. The script is then executed with iex (Invoke-Expression), which is commonly used in PowerShell for executing strings as code. This is a classic technique used in malware to download and run payloads.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the command_line: 'powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. This command is creating a new PSDrive mapped to the Target's C$ share, which is a network share. This could indicate that the attacker is trying to access files on a remote system, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The repetition of this command across multiple logs suggests it's part of an ongoing process.\n\nThe winlog tasks are mostly 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle', which are part of Windows Event Log tasks. However, the combination of these commands with the lifecycle tasks might indicate that the malicious activity is being logged as part of normal operations, which could be an attempt to blend in.\n\nThe fact that the same malicious command is repeated multiple times across different logs increases the likelihood of a security incident. The use of both downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repo and mapping a network drive are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Even though GitHub can be a legitimate source, the specific script name and the context here are concerning.\n\nI should check if the GitHub repo is known for malicious activity. \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" might be a typo or a deliberate misspelling of \"SecureThisShit\", which could be a known malicious repository. The presence of \"WinPwn.ps1\" suggests it's a PowerShell script designed for exploitation, possibly part of a post-exploitation toolkit.\n\nThe logs don't show any obvious signs of being false positives, like typical benign activities. The repetition and the specific commands are strong indicators. Therefore, this batch of logs is likely related to a security incident and should be classified as INTERESTING with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands are observed downloading and executing a suspicious script (WinPwn.ps1) from a GitHub repository, followed by network drive mapping attempts.
