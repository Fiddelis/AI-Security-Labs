{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe command that uses schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line here is important. It's setting up a daily task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is often used to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the filename has \"NonExistingScript\" which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to hide the real script name or it's a typo. Also, the task is created under the system account, which is a high-privilege account. That's concerning.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating a task again, with a similar command line but a different script name: entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1. Again, the \"NonExistingScript\" part is odd. The task is named \"win32times,\" which doesn't seem like a standard task name. Also, the file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times might be the scheduled task itself, but that's a common location for scheduled tasks, so not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are multiple entries for svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. svchost.exe is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes might indicate something. However, chrome.exe doing registry changes repeatedly could be normal if it's part of updates or extensions, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the majority of the suspicious activity is around the scheduled tasks and PowerShell commands.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entries are creating files, which might be part of logging, but not necessarily malicious. The other PowerShell events with File created might be benign, but combined with the scheduled tasks, it's a concern.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks under the system account with PowerShell scripts that have names suggesting they might not exist, combined with the use of -ep bypass, which is a common tactic in attacks to execute scripts without proper permissions. The repetition of similar commands with different script names could indicate an attempt to evade detection. The presence of multiple registry changes by cmd.exe and schtasks.exe also adds to the suspicion.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware execution or data exfiltration. The scripts referenced don't exist, which could be a red herring or a mistake. But the overall pattern of creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges and using PowerShell in a way that bypasses execution policies is indicative of potential malicious activity. Therefore, this batch is likely worth investigating further.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate **potential malicious activity** warranting further investigation. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges:**\n   - **`cmd.exe`** and **`schtasks.exe`** are used to create scheduled tasks under the **`SYSTEM`** account (high-privilege), which is unusual and often exploited in attacks.\n   - Example command:\n     ```bash\n     schtasks.exe \/create \/tn \"win32times\" \/tr \"powershell.exe -ep bypass -f C:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1\" \/sc daily\n     ```\n     - **`-ep bypass`** is a common tactic to bypass PowerShell execution policies.\n     - The script names (`NonExistingScript.ps1`) are suspicious, possibly indicating obfuscation or a false flag.\n\n2. **Unusual File Paths and Script Names:**\n   - The referenced scripts (`C:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1`, `C:\\...entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1`) have names suggesting they may not exist or are intentionally misleading, which is often seen in malware evasion techniques.\n\n3. **Repetitive Registry Modifications:**\n   - **`cmd.exe`** and **`chrome.exe`** are involved in multiple **registry value set** events. While registry changes are normal, the repetition and lack of clear purpose (e.g., no associated application updates) raise concerns.\n\n4. **Lack of Clear Legitimate Purpose:**\n   - The tasks (`win32times`) and scripts have no obvious benign purpose. No evidence of legitimate system updates, user activity, or application behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Creating tasks under the `SYSTEM` account could allow persistence or escalation of privileges.\n- **Execution Policy Bypass:** Use of `-ep bypass` suggests an attempt to execute scripts without user interaction or security restrictions.\n- **Malware Evasion:** The script names and repetitive commands may indicate an attempt to avoid detection by security tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Tasks:**\n   - Check the actual content of the referenced scripts (if they exist) for malicious payloads.\n   - Verify if the tasks are part of a legitimate system process or user-initiated action.\n\n2. **Monitor for PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Audit PowerShell logs for additional bypasses or unexpected script execution.\n\n3. **Check for Lateral Movement:**\n   - Investigate if the `whoami.exe` and `winlogbeat.exe` processes are related to the suspicious tasks (e.g., reconnaissance or data exfiltration).\n\n4. **File Integrity Checks:**\n   - Verify the integrity of files in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\` and user directories for tampering.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis log batch shows **highly suspicious behavior** consistent with **malware persistence mechanisms** or **privilege escalation attempts**. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether this is a security incident."}
