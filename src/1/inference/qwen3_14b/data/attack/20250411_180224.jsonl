{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate process, so maybe just a normal installation or configuration. Then there's powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. Hmm, PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious tasks. But creating a text file isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNext, there's another ProcessAccess event for powershell.exe, but no file path. Not sure what that means. Then whoami.exe is executed, which is a standard tool to check user context. That's normal. Another ProcessAccess for powershell.exe again. \n\nWait, are there any signs of suspicious activity? The first event is a file creation by winlogbeat, which is a log shipper. Maybe part of a setup. The other PowerShell events don't have clear malicious indicators. No unexpected file paths, no known malware names. The whoami.exe is benign. \n\nBut maybe the combination of multiple PowerShell activities and file creations could be a red flag. However, without more context like network activity or unusual commands, it's hard to tell. The confidence here is low because there's not enough evidence of malicious behavior. So the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process and file creation activities, including a legitimate winlogbeat installation and benign PowerShell operations. No indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I should look for any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' activities. One entry stands out: the command line for cmd.exe includes creating a scheduled task with 'schtasks \/create' that runs a PowerShell script. The script path is 'c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1' and another one 'c:\\\\entrada_temporario_NonExistingScript.ps1'. Both filenames have 'NonExistingScript' in them, which makes me think that maybe these files don't actually exist. That could be a red flag because attackers sometimes use non-existent files to avoid detection, or maybe they're trying to execute commands that aren't properly set up.\n\nAlso, there's a scheduled task named 'win32times' being created with the user 'system' and set to run daily. That's a bit concerning because running tasks under the system account can be a sign of privilege escalation. The use of '-ep bypass' in PowerShell is another suspicious element because that's used to bypass execution policies, which is common in malicious scripts.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated 'Registry value set' events for 'svchost.exe' and 'chrome.exe'. While svchost is a legitimate process, multiple registry changes might indicate something's wrong. However, the presence of 'chrome.exe' making registry changes repeatedly could be more suspicious, but I need to check if that's normal. However, the main issue here is the scheduled task creation and the PowerShell commands.\n\nThe 'File created' events for 'winlogbeat.yml.new' and 'estrutura_geral.txt' might be benign, but the main concern is the scheduled tasks and the PowerShell execution. Also, the 'Image loaded' events for 'taskschd.dll' are normal since that's part of the Task Scheduler, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nPutting this together, the creation of a scheduled task with a non-existent script, using elevated privileges (system account), bypassing execution policies, and multiple registry changes could indicate an attempted compromise. Even though some entries might be normal, the combination of these activities suggests a potential security threat. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts using non-existent file paths, use of '-ep bypass' to bypass execution policies, and repeated registry modifications by system processes. These patterns are indicative of potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
