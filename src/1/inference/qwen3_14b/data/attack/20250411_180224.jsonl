{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first event, it's a powershell.exe process with a registry value set. Not immediately suspicious, but PowerShell is often used by attackers. Then there's a cmd.exe process that runs schtasks to create a scheduled task. The command line here is important. It sets up a daily task that runs a PowerShell script with -ep bypass, which is a common technique to bypass execution policies. The script path is c:\\objeto_logico_NonExistingScript.ps1. Wait, the file name has \"NonExistingScript\", which might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to disguise the script's name or it's a typo. But the fact that they're creating a scheduled task under the system account with elevated privileges is concerning.\n\nAnother event shows schtasks.exe creating a task again, with a similar command line but a different non-existent script name. Then there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\win32times. Scheduled tasks in that directory are typically system tasks, so creating a new one here might be unauthorized. Also, the image loaded for schtasks.exe is taskschd.dll, which is legitimate, but the context of creating a task with system permissions is suspicious.\n\nThere are multiple entries for svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. Chrome entries are numerous, but they all have the same task, which might be normal or could indicate some kind of monitoring. However, svchost.exe is a common host process, but if it's modifying the registry, that might be part of a larger attack. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe other events include file creations like .winlogbeat.yml.new and estrutura_geral.txt. Those might be benign, like configuration files or logs. However, the presence of multiple registry modifications and scheduled tasks could indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts that don't exist (or may be renamed), using system privileges, and multiple registry changes could be signs of an attacker trying to persist on the system. The use of -ep bypass is a known technique to execute scripts without restrictions. Even though some files are normal, the combination of these events raises a red flag. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity: scheduled tasks created with PowerShell scripts using -ep bypass (bypassing execution policies), non-existent script paths in command lines, and repeated registry modifications. These are common indicators of persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal, maybe part of an installation or configuration. Then there's powershell.exe creating a file called entrada_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious tasks.\n\nNext, there are two entries about ProcessAccess for powershell.exe, but no file path. Maybe they're accessing processes but not files. Then whoami.exe is run, which is a standard command to get user info. That's usually benign. \n\nWait, but why are there multiple PowerShell events? Creating a file and then accessing processes. Could be part of a script that's normal, but maybe there's something suspicious. However, without more context like the content of entrada_ativo.txt or details of the process access, it's hard to tell. The presence of whoami.exe is normal. \n\nI don't see any obvious malicious activity here. The events don't indicate unauthorized access, unusual network activity, or execution of known malicious files. The files created are in the Downloads folder, which is common. Maybe the user is just doing some setup. Without more indicators like unexpected network calls, privilege escalation, or known malicious hashes, this might not be interesting. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the confidence should be medium. Hmm, but the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear sign of attack. The justification would be lack of suspicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"No clear signs of malicious activity detected. Events include normal file creation by winlogbeat.exe (likely log configuration), PowerShell script execution (common for legitimate tasks), and standard process access\/creation. No suspicious file paths, unexpected network activity, or indicators of compromise observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
