That seems suspicious because searching for passwords in files might indicate an attempt to find sensitive information. \n\nLooking at the other events, there's a winlogbeat file created, which is a log shipper, but that's normal. Notepad and calc.exe are standard processes. Some registry events and image loads, like urlmon.dll and MpClient.dll, which are legitimate system files. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords across multiple file types could be a red flag. \n\nI should check if there are any other unusual activities.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each entry step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the majority of the events: there are multiple entries where the process is chrome.exe, and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\" or \"Dns query (rule: DnsQuery)\". Also, there are some \"Network connection detected\" events. But chrome.exe doing these things—registry changes, DNS queries, network connections—could be normal, especially for a browser. However, the repetition might be a red flag. But maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nThen, there's one event where the process is winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, and it created a file in the Downloads directory. That might be normal if someone is setting up the tool, but the file path seems a bit generic. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother event shows chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files (Amsi is part of Windows Defender, MpOAV is from Windows Defender as well). So that's probably normal. But maybe if they were loaded from unexpected locations, but the paths here are standard.\n\nThen there's a file created by powershell.exe with the name \"objeto_logico.txt\". That's a regular text file. Unless there's something suspicious about the content, but the event just mentions the file creation. Not sure yet.\n\nNow, looking for anomalies. The repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe—could be a sign of something trying to modify registry settings, which is a common attack vector. But again, chrome might do that for its own configuration. However, if there's a large number of such events, that might be concerning. The batch has several of these, but not sure if it's enough to flag.\n\nAlso, the DNS queries and network connections are normal for a browser, but again, if they're going to unusual domains, that would be a problem. But the events here don't mention the domains, just the task name.\n\nThe winlogbeat event is creating a .yml.new file. Maybe that's part of a configuration setup. If the user is installing or configuring winlogbeat, that's normal. But if it's unexpected, maybe not. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe powershell file creation seems benign. Unless the file is being used for malicious purposes, but the event doesn't indicate that.\n\nPutting it all together: most events are related to chrome.exe doing normal things. The winlogbeat and powershell events don't show obvious signs of malicious activity. However, the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe could be worth investigating. But I'm not sure if it's enough to classify as \"interesting\". Maybe the confidence is moderate. But I need to check if there's anything else.\n\nWait, the user provided a batch of events. The majority are chrome.exe with registry changes and DNS queries. But is that unusual? Maybe if there's a pattern, but without knowing the baseline, it's hard. However, in a typical scenario, a browser might not be modifying the registry that much. So maybe this is a sign of something else. But again, could be part of the browser's normal operations. Hmm.\n\nAnother thing: the file created by winlogbeat is a .yml.new file. That might be a temporary file during configuration. But if it's in the Downloads folder, maybe that's not standard. However, the user might have placed it there. Not sure.\n\nOverall, the events don't show clear signs of malware or attacks. The most suspicious part is the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the system is a normal user's machine, this might be normal. But if it's a server or a system that shouldn't have chrome.exe doing registry changes, then it's suspicious. Since the user hasn't provided context, maybe the answer is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no clear malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal browser activity (registry changes, DNS queries, network connections) and benign file operations (winlogbeat configuration, PowerShell text file creation).

That's a common scenario when installing software, so maybe not suspicious. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. Not sure what that is, but maybe benign. \n\nThen there's a lot of entries with powershell.exe and process access or registry events. Multiple times, powershell is involved in ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent tasks. That could be normal, but repeated access might be a red flag. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a cmd.exe running schtasks commands to delete scheduled tasks. Deleting tasks might be part of cleaning up, but if done by an attacker, it could be to remove evidence. Also, there are multiple instances of schtasks.exe being executed with \/delete, which could indicate an attempt to remove scheduled tasks, possibly malicious ones. \n\nThe svchost.exe and conhost.exe entries with registry events might be normal system operations, but combined with the other activities, it's worth checking. \n\nThe repetition of powershell.exe accessing processes and modifying registry values could be part of a script or malware trying to persist or modify system settings. The fact that there are multiple deletions of scheduled tasks might be an attempt to hide malicious activities. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware, like file downloads from suspicious sources or unusual network activity. The logs don't show any clear malicious payloads or unexpected file creations beyond the normal installation files. \n\nBut the combination of multiple process accesses, registry modifications, and scheduled task deletions could indicate someone trying to manipulate the system.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first entry: cmd.exe is running a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That seems odd because deleting processes isn't a typical user action. Then there's powershell.exe being accessed and registry value changes. Multiple entries show registry value sets, which could be part of a configuration change or something more malicious.\n\nLooking further, there's WMIC.exe being used multiple times, and it's loading some DLLs from Windows System32 and even from Windows Defender's directory. Loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll might be a red flag because those are related to antivirus and security features. If an attacker is trying to disable or bypass these, that's a bad sign.\n\nThen there's the deletion of user accounts using net user \/del. Deleting user accounts could be part of a cleanup after an attack or an attempt to remove evidence. The presence of multiple cmd.exe and powershell.exe processes running commands to delete users and processes is concerning. Also, the use of net1.exe, which might be a typo or a malicious binary pretending to be net.exe, could be an indicator of compromise.\n\nThe repeated registry modifications and process creations, especially with commands that delete processes and users, suggest that someone is trying to manipulate the system. The combination of these events points towards potential malicious activity, like an attacker trying to remove traces of their presence or taking control of the system.\n\nI should check if all these events are part of normal operations. But deleting processes, modifying registry values, and deleting user accounts don't seem normal.

So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes, there are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe. Now, PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious activities. The same goes for cmd.exe. Now, the command lines here might be a clue. For example, one of the entries has \"cmd.exe \/c net user modulo_auxiliar_Admin >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". That command is deleting a user from the domain. That's a bit suspicious because deleting users isn't typically something that's done in a normal operational context unless it's part of a cleanup, but in a log, repeated user deletions might indicate something else, like an attacker trying to remove accounts.\n\nAnother line shows \"net.exe user pacote_auxiliar_Admin \/del \/domain\" and \"net1.exe user tarefa_padrao_Admin \/del \/domain\". The use of net.exe and net1.exe (which might be a typo or a renamed executable) to delete users again. Also, there's a command to delete a service with \"sc delete win32times\" and \"sc.exe delete win32times\". Deleting services could be part of removing malicious software, but if done by an attacker, it might be to cover their tracks.\n\nThen there's the use of whoami.exe, which is usually used to check the current user's identity. That could be part of reconnaissance. Also, multiple entries of registry value changes and process accesses. The fact that there are multiple deletions of users and services, along with registry modifications, might indicate an attempt to alter system configurations or remove evidence.\n\nHowever, I need to check if these actions are part of normal administrative tasks. But considering the repetition of deleting users and services, and the use of commands that are typically associated with administrative tasks but in a way that's not clearly justified by the logs, it's more likely to be suspicious. Also, the presence of multiple process creations and registry events could point to an ongoing attack or a script that's being run to modify the system.\n\nBut there's no direct evidence of malware or network activity here. The logs are focused on local system changes. However, the combination of user deletions, service deletions, and registry changes could be part of a larger attack, such as an insider trying to remove their traces or an attacker compromising the system and making changes. Since the logs don't include network events or file modifications, but the local changes are significant enough, this might be worth investigating further.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of multiple user and service deletions, along with registry changes, using command-line tools, suggests potential malicious activity. Therefore, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75.

Let me start by going through each event.\n\nFirst, there's a 'whoami.exe' process created, which is normal since it's a built-in command. Then, multiple 'powershell.exe' and 'cmd.exe' processes are accessed or created. Some entries have registry value sets and file deletions. One event shows a file deletion in the Temp directory, which might be suspicious if it's deleting something unexpected. However, the command line for 'cmd.exe' includes deleting temporary files, which could be part of normal cleanup. \n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there are several 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks. The command lines like 'powershell.exe & {}' seem odd because the '{}' is an empty script block. That might indicate a failed attempt to execute a script or a placeholder. Repeated entries with the same command line could be a red flag, especially if they're part of a larger attack pattern, like trying to execute malicious code that's not yet formed.\n\nThe image loads for 'mscoree.dll', 'mscoreei.dll', and 'clr.dll' are related to .NET runtime components. While these are legitimate, if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might be concerning. However, the logs don't show any immediate malicious activity here.\n\nCombining all these, the repeated PowerShell commands with empty script blocks might suggest an attempt to execute something, possibly part of a larger attack.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a lot of \"Image loaded\" events related to PowerShell.exe. The files mentioned are some system DLLs like mscorlib.ni.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are part of the .NET framework, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a mention of MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file too, but maybe the fact that PowerShell is loading it is worth noting.\n\nNext, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. The file is a PowerShell script. Creating and deleting a temporary file might be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like executing malicious code, that could be a red flag. However, just creating and deleting a file isn't necessarily bad. The name \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\" suggests it might be related to a script policy test, which could be benign, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's an unusual number or specific context, it might be suspicious. However, the log doesn't give much detail here.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the processes: \"powershell.exe & {}\". That seems like an empty command, maybe a test or a benign operation. The \"Engine Lifecycle\" task might be part of PowerShell's normal operation.\n\nThere are several \"Process accessed\" events for PowerShell. This could indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which might be normal, but if there's a lot of access or from unusual sources, that's a concern. However, the logs don't specify which processes are accessing it.\n\nThere are also entries for whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user information, so unless it's being used in a suspicious context, it's probably normal.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be part of its normal operation. The .yml.new file suggests it's a new configuration, which could be part of an update or setup.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main points are: PowerShell loading system DLLs, creating and deleting a temp script, some process access events, and standard commands like whoami. None of these events individually seem highly suspicious. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell-related events, including the temporary script creation and deletion, might indicate some activity that's worth investigating further. But since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, unusual network activity, or unauthorized access, it's on the borderline.

'whoami.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool that shows the current user's identity, so that's normal. But 'powershell.exe' is commonly used by attackers for executing commands. However, just seeing PowerShell being accessed might not be enough to flag it as malicious. \n\nWait, there are multiple entries of 'Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)' for PowerShell. That could indicate that someone is trying to interact with the process, maybe injecting code or something. But again, it's not definitive. \n\nThen I notice some 'Image loaded' events pointing to 'urlmon.dll'. That's a legitimate DLL part of Windows, used for URL downloads. But if it's being loaded by processes like 'calc.exe' or 'Calculator.exe', that might be normal. However, if these processes are not supposed to be loading that DLL, it could be a sign of something wrong. But without more context, like unexpected parent processes or unusual parameters, it's hard to tell.\n\nThere's also a 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But the filename is a .yml.new, which could be part of a configuration update. However, if this is unexpected, it might be worth checking. \n\nLooking at the network connections from 'chrome.exe', multiple DNS queries and network connections are normal for a browser. Unless there's a connection to a suspicious IP or domain, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nThe Registry events involve 'Registry value set' by various processes. That's common for legitimate software updates, but if there's a pattern of changing critical registry keys, that could be malicious. However, the logs don't specify which keys are being modified, so it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, there's a lot of normal system activity here. The repeated PowerShell accesses and image loads might be benign. Without more indicators like unusual command lines, unexpected network traffic, or changes to sensitive registry keys, this doesn't look like a clear attack. The presence of some legitimate processes and normal activities makes me think this is not interesting for investigation. But I should check if there's any odd combination. For example, multiple 'whoami.exe' calls might be part of a script, but again, not necessarily malicious. \n\nHmm, maybe the confidence is low.
