{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying the registry. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows, so that's okay. Notepad modifying the registry might be normal too, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe accessing processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers, but it's also a common tool. Not sure yet. The next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded from an unusual place, that could be a red flag. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32, which is standard. Maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nNow, looking at the cmd.exe entry. The command line shows creating scheduled tasks with names like \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\". The command lines use calc.exe, which is a benign process, but the fact that they're creating tasks on logon and startup might be a sign of persistence. Also, the user here is 'system' for one of the tasks, which could be a concern if it's not expected.\n\nThen there's schtasks.exe creating tasks, which is normal, but the names are a bit odd with those prefixes. The next entry is Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll again. Same path, so still legitimate.\n\nLooking further, svchost.exe is modifying the registry multiple times. Svchost is a common host process, but frequent registry changes could indicate something. Then, there's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon and another at pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup. These are scheduled task files. The names are again unusual and might be part of a naming pattern that's not standard. Creating tasks in the System32 directory is normal, but the names are suspicious.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry, which might be normal, but combined with the scheduled task creations, it could indicate an attempt to establish persistence. The use of cmd.exe and schtasks.exe to create these tasks suggests someone is trying to set up recurring commands, possibly for malicious purposes.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of multiple scheduled tasks with non-standard names, combined with registry modifications and the use of cmd and schtasks, could be an indicator of an attacker trying to maintain access. Even though some processes like chrome and calc are legitimate, the pattern of task creation and the registry changes might be suspicious. The confidence here is moderate because while some activities are normal, the combination and frequency might point to something malicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation, particularly **scheduled task creation** and **registry modifications** that could indicate **malicious persistence mechanisms**. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Scheduled Task Creation with Non-Standard Names**\n- **Events**:  \n  - `schtasks.exe` creates tasks named:  \n    - `modulo_principal_005_OnStartup`  \n    - `pacote_comum_005_OnLogon`  \n    - `pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup`  \n  - These tasks execute `cmd.exe \/c calc.exe`, which is **benign** on its own but **suspicious in context**.  \n  - **Why it's concerning**:  \n    - The naming pattern (`pacote_`, `modulo_`, `OnStartup`) suggests **non-native or obfuscated task names**, which is atypical for legitimate Windows tasks.  \n    - Tasks are created in **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\`**, a standard location, but the **unusual naming** and **repeated task creation** (multiple entries) raise flags.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Use of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` for Persistence**\n- **Event**:  \n  - A `cmd.exe` process runs:  \n    ```bash\n    schtasks \/create \/tn \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" \/sc onlogon \/tr \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\"\n    ```\n  - **Why it's concerning**:  \n    - **`\/sc onlogon`** ensures the task runs at user login, which could be an attempt to **establish persistence**.  \n    - The use of **`calc.exe`** (a harmless utility) as the payload is likely a **stealth technique** to avoid detection (e.g., hiding malicious activity behind a legitimate process).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Frequent Registry Modifications**\n- **Events**:  \n  - Multiple entries show **`svchost.exe`** and **`cmd.exe`** modifying the registry (e.g., `Registry value set`).  \n  - **Why it's concerning**:  \n    - **`svchost.exe`** is a legitimate Windows process, but **frequent or unexpected registry changes** could indicate **malicious configuration changes** (e.g., altering startup entries, disabling security features).  \n    - Combined with scheduled task creation, this may suggest an **attempt to modify system behavior**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Legitimate Processes with Suspicious Context**\n- **`calc.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:  \n  - These are **legitimate processes**, but their **association with task creation** and **registry changes** could indicate **process injection** or **covert execution**.  \n- **`conhost.exe`** (console host) is often used for **interactive command-line sessions**, but its **repeated involvement** in registry modifications may be anomalous.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n- **Risk Level**: **Medium to High** (depending on the system's baseline behavior).  \n- **Key Suspicion**:  \n  - **Malicious persistence** via scheduled tasks with unusual names.  \n  - **Registry tampering** that could disable security controls or alter system behavior.  \n- **Recommended Actions**:  \n  1. **Investigate the source** of the scheduled tasks (e.g., user accounts, scripts).  \n  2. **Check for unauthorized changes** to the registry (e.g., startup keys, service configurations).  \n  3. **Analyze `calc.exe` and `conhost.exe`** for signs of process injection or code execution.  \n  4. **Validate the legitimacy** of the task names and their associated commands.  \n\nThis activity is **not definitively malicious** but **strongly indicative of a potential attack** attempting to establish persistence."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's svchost.exe, ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe, and whoami.exe. Some of these are normal system processes, like svchost and chrome. But powershell.exe and whoami.exe are often used in attacks, so that's a red flag.\n\nNow, the events. There are several Registry value set events. That's common for some legitimate activities, but if done in a pattern, it might be part of a configuration change. However, the key thing here is the file creation events. For example, winlogbeat.exe created a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but I need to check the path. The path is in the user's Downloads directory, which could be a sign of someone manually setting up the tool, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's the File created event for unidade_ativo.txt by powershell.exe. Creating a text file isn't inherently bad, but the name \"unidade_ativo.txt\" might be a placeholder or part of a script. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe Image loaded events for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files from Windows Defender. Chrome loading them might be normal, but if it's an unusual process, that could be a sign of something. However, since Chrome can interact with system components, maybe it's just part of its operation.\n\nThe whoami.exe process is just a normal command to check user context, so that's probably benign. \n\nNow, looking for patterns. There are multiple Registry value set events for chrome.exe. That might be part of Chrome's normal operation, but if there's a lot of them, maybe it's trying to modify settings. However, the presence of multiple events doesn't necessarily mean malicious intent.\n\nThe main concern here is the use of powershell.exe for file creation. PowerShell is often used in attacks to execute scripts or create files. But in this case, the files created are a config file for winlogbeat and a text file. Unless there's a script involved that's not shown here, it might not be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: there's no clear evidence of a security incident. The events are mostly normal system activities. The use of PowerShell and Chrome's registry changes aren't enough to flag this as suspicious. The confidence is low because there's no clear malicious activity, but the presence of some potentially risky processes and events might warrant a closer look. However, since the justification requires a concise explanation, I'd say it's not interesting because there's no concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not conclusively indicate a security incident or malicious activity. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Legitimate Processes**: \n   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `chrome.exe`, and `winlogbeat.exe` are commonly used in normal system operations. `winlogbeat.exe` creating a configuration file (`unidade_ativo.txt`) in the user's Downloads directory could be part of manual setup or data export, not inherently malicious.\n\n2. **PowerShell Usage**:\n   - `powershell.exe` is used for file creation (`unidade_ativo.txt`) and process access. While PowerShell is often associated with attacks, the absence of suspicious commands or payloads (e.g., script execution, network activity) makes this inconclusive.\n\n3. **Registry Activity**:\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` events for `chrome.exe` may relate to normal configuration changes. No evidence of tampering or unauthorized modifications is present.\n\n4. **Whoami.exe**:\n   - The `whoami.exe` process is a standard utility for checking user context, with no suspicious behavior observed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo clear indicators of compromise (e.g., unexpected network traffic, anomalous file operations, or malicious payloads) are present. The activities align with typical system behavior, even if some processes (like PowerShell) are often exploited in attacks. \n\n**Final Judgment**: **Not interesting for investigation** (confidence: low). The logs do not contain sufficient evidence to warrant further action."}
