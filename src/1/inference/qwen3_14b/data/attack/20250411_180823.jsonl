{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of chrome.exe, which is normal, but then there are some other processes like RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, powershell.exe, calc.exe, svchost.exe, cmd.exe, schtasks.exe, and Calculator.exe. The winlog tasks include things like DNS queries, network connections, registry changes, process access, image loaded, and file creation.\n\nNow, the key here is to spot any suspicious activity. Let's see. The first few entries are chrome.exe doing DNS queries and network connections. That's typical for a browser, so probably not an issue. Then there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe changing registry values. Not sure yet, maybe legitimate, but need to check more.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed, which can be normal but sometimes used for malicious scripts. The calc.exe entries are interesting because they're loading urlmon.dll, which is a legitimate DLL, but if it's being loaded in an unusual context, that could be a red flag. However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\urlmon.dll, which is the standard location, so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, there's a cmd.exe process with a command line that includes creating scheduled tasks. The command line is: \"cmd.exe\" \/c schtasks \/create \/tn \"elemento_auxiliar_005_OnLogon\" \/sc onlogon \/tr \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\" & schtasks \/create \/tn \"unidade_secundario_005_OnStartup\" \/sc onstart \/ru system \/tr \"cmd.exe \/c calc.exe\". That looks suspicious. Creating scheduled tasks on logon and startup, especially with the \/ru system parameter, which runs the task as the system user. That could be an attempt to persistently execute calc.exe, which is a common technique for malware to maintain access.\n\nThen there's another schtasks.exe process creating a task named \"modulo_principal_005_OnStartup\" with the same command. Also, a file is created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\pacote_comum_005_OnLogon, which is a scheduled task file. The presence of multiple scheduled tasks being created by schtasks.exe with commands that trigger calc.exe seems like a potential indicator of compromise. Even though calc.exe is a legitimate application, the way it's being triggered through scheduled tasks might be part of a larger malicious activity, especially if it's being used to execute other commands or download payloads.\n\nAlso, the fact that multiple registry values are being set by various processes might indicate configuration changes that could be part of a malware's persistence mechanism. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But the combination of scheduled task creation and the use of calc.exe in that context is a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of schtasks.exe and cmd.exe to create these tasks. This could be an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Even though some of these tasks might be benign, the pattern here is concerning, especially if there's no prior knowledge of these tasks being legitimate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch does show signs of potentially malicious activity, such as creating scheduled tasks with unusual names and triggering calc.exe, which might be a cover for more nefarious actions. The confidence level is high enough to classify this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple scheduled tasks are created using schtasks.exe with commands that launch calc.exe, which is unusual and may indicate persistence mechanisms or malicious activity. Additionally, registry modifications and process access events suggest potential system tampering.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll look through the events to see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, most of them are common Windows processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, powershell.exe, etc. But I notice a few things. There's a file created event for a task in the Windows Tasks directory called \"pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup\". That name seems a bit odd. Usually, legitimate tasks might have more generic names, but this one has \"pacote_ativo\" which might be a Portuguese term, maybe \"active package\"? Not sure, but it's unusual.\n\nThen, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file path is in the Downloads directory, which isn't too suspicious on its own. However, there's also a file created by powershell.exe named \"unidade_ativo.txt\". Again, the name is in Portuguese, and \"unidade_ativo\" might translate to \"active unit\" or something similar. That's not necessarily bad, but combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nAnother thing is that chrome.exe is involved in multiple registry value set events. While chrome does interact with the registry, a high number of such events might indicate some kind of modification or injection. Also, there's an image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files (Amsi is part of Windows Defender), but if they're being loaded from unexpected locations or in unusual contexts, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so maybe that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at the processes: svchost.exe is a common host process for Windows services, so it's normal to see it doing registry operations. However, multiple instances of svchost.exe doing the same task might be normal, but not necessarily suspicious. The same goes for other processes like conhost.exe and ApplicationFrameHost.exe.\n\nThe key points here are the creation of the task in the startup folder and the creation of the text file. If an attacker is trying to establish persistence, creating a startup task is a common method. The file names might be part of obfuscation or just random names. Also, the presence of powershell.exe creating files could be part of normal user activity, but it's something to check.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there's some suspicious activity, but not definitive proof of malicious intent. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the unusual file names and the creation of a startup task. However, the confidence isn't 100% because some events could be benign. Maybe the user is just running some scripts or installing software. But the combination of events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications and file creation events involving suspicious file paths (e.g., 'pacote_ativo_005_OnStartup' in System32\\\\Tasks and 'unidade_ativo.txt') suggest potential persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration attempts.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_180823.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting or not. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines. Each line represents an event. The main thing here is to look for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, looking at the processes involved. There are multiple entries for chrome.exe with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". Chrome is a common browser, but modifying the registry could be suspicious if it's done in a way that's not typical. However, if it's just setting values, maybe it's part of normal operations. But the fact that there are so many entries for chrome.exe doing this might be a red flag. Maybe it's a persistence mechanism or something else.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with \"Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)\" and another one. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so this could be a sign of something. But again, it's a common tool, so not necessarily malicious. However, if it's being accessed in an unusual way, that's a problem.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe, which is a legitimate tool that displays the current user's identity. The command line shows it's being run from the system32 directory, which is normal. But why is it being executed? If it's part of a normal process, maybe not. But if it's being used in a script to escalate privileges or something, that's bad.\n\nNow, combining all these events. The majority are chrome.exe modifying the registry. That's a lot of events. Maybe the attacker is using chrome to write to the registry for persistence. Then there's PowerShell being accessed, which could be a sign of further actions. The whoami.exe might be part of checking user privileges.\n\nBut wait, are there any other indicators? The file field is \"None\" for all entries, so no file access is mentioned. That's a bit odd. Maybe the events are related to process and registry changes rather than files. \n\nHowever, the confidence here is a bit low because these activities could be part of normal operations. For example, Chrome might modify the registry as part of its own processes, and PowerShell is a common tool. But the high frequency of chrome.exe modifying the registry might be a sign of something unusual. Also, the combination of registry changes and process access might indicate an attacker trying to manipulate the system.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The justification needs to be concise. Maybe the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because of the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe and the use of PowerShell, which could be indicative of malicious activity. However, the confidence might be around 0.6 because while the events are suspicious, they could also be benign. But I need to check if there's a clear pattern here. If the same process is doing the same action multiple times, that's more suspicious. So, the confidence might be higher. Let me think again.\n\nIf chrome.exe is setting registry values multiple times, that's more than normal. Maybe it's a sign of a registry-based payload or something. The PowerShell access might be related to executing commands. The whoami.exe could be part of checking the user context. So combining these, the classification is interesting. Confidence around 0.7 maybe. But I need to make sure that there's no other explanation. Since the user says to consider the entire batch, the repetition of the same event (chrome.exe registry set) multiple times is a key point here. That's more likely to be suspicious. So the justification would be the repeated registry modifications by chrome and the use of PowerShell, which could indicate malicious activity. Confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple chrome.exe instances modifying registry values (potentially for persistence) combined with PowerShell process access and whoami.exe execution suggest possible malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
