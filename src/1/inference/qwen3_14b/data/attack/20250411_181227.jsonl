{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. There are multiple entries with PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks. Each command is using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, which is a common trick to test or simulate malicious behavior. The tasks are set to trigger at logon, and they're registered under various names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The user group is BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level, which is a red flag because it's giving high privileges.\n\nAlso, there are several Image Load events pointing to .NET DLLs. While these are legitimate, the combination with the scheduled tasks might indicate an attempt to execute code with elevated privileges. However, calc.exe is a benign application, so maybe this is just a test or a false positive. But the repetition of similar commands across multiple events raises suspicion. The presence of multiple scheduled tasks with different names but the same structure suggests a pattern, which could be part of a larger attack.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender path, which seems legitimate. Then, a file is created in the Temp directory, which isn't too unusual. But then that same file is deleted. Hmm, creating and deleting a file quickly might be part of a script trying to clean up after itself. \n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but alone, it's not necessarily malicious. However, combined with other events, it might be a red flag. \n\nThen, looking at the command line for powershell.exe, there's a script that's creating a scheduled task to run calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group and high privileges. That's suspicious because calc.exe is a harmless calculator, but using it in a scheduled task with admin rights might be a way to execute arbitrary code later. The script is using Register-ScheduledTask, which is a legitimate command but could be abused for persistence.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome modifying its own registry might be normal, but if it's doing it repeatedly or in unexpected ways, that could be a sign of something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nBut wait, the majority of the logs are about chrome.exe and some other processes, but the key part here is the powershell.exe events. The scheduled task creation with high privileges is a big red flag. Also, the fact that the same command line appears twice suggests that this might be a repeated attempt or a script that's being run multiple times. \n\nAdditionally, there are several \"Execute a Remote Command\" events with the process field as None. That's odd because if the process is None, it might indicate that the event is not properly logged or that the source is unknown, which could be a sign of an attack vector that's not being captured correctly by the logs.\n\nPutting it all together: the creation of a scheduled task with admin privileges, the use of PowerShell for this, and the multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" entries without a process might indicate a potential security threat. The user should investigate further to see if these tasks are legitimate or if they're part of a larger attack, like establishing persistence or executing malicious payloads under admin rights. The presence of these events, especially the scheduled task, is a strong indicator that this batch is worth looking into.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events contains **multiple suspicious activities** that warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Suspicious Indicators:**\n1. **Scheduled Task with Administrative Privileges**  \n   - A PowerShell script is creating a scheduled task (`Register-ScheduledTask`) to execute `calc.exe` at logon, targeting the **Administrators group** with **High privileges**.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - While `calc.exe` is a benign utility, using it as a payload in a scheduled task with administrative rights could be a **technique for persistence or privilege escalation**.  \n     - The script's structure (`New-ScheduledTaskAction`, `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger`) is legitimate but often abused in attacks to execute arbitrary code.\n\n2. **File Creation and Immediate Deletion**  \n   - A temporary file is created and deleted in the Temp directory.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - This pattern is common in **malicious scripts** that attempt to execute code and then clean up traces (e.g., downloading payloads or executing commands).\n\n3. **Repetitive \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events**  \n   - Over 20 events log \"Execute a Remote Command\" with the **`process` field set to `None`**.  \n   - **Why this is concerning**:  \n     - This could indicate **incomplete or corrupted log entries**, or **unauthorized remote execution attempts** that are not properly attributed to a process.  \n     - The repetition suggests a **potential attack vector** (e.g., brute-force, remote code execution, or lateral movement).\n\n4. **PowerShell Scripting**  \n   - The use of PowerShell for creating scheduled tasks is **common in attacks** (e.g., for persistence, privilege escalation, or command-and-control communication).\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Assessment:**\n- **Likely Threat**: **Persistence Mechanism or Initial Compromise**  \n  - The scheduled task with administrative rights could be part of an attacker's plan to maintain access to the system.  \n  - The \"Execute a Remote Command\" events may indicate **unauthorized remote activity** or **log tampering**.\n\n- **Severity**: **High**  \n  - The combination of administrative privilege escalation, file cleanup, and unexplained remote command events suggests a **potential security breach**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Investigate the Scheduled Task**  \n   - Check the system's Task Scheduler for tasks named `unidade_comum` or `unidade_comum` (from the script).  \n   - Verify if `calc.exe` is being used as a legitimate utility or if it's a **trojanized executable**.\n\n2. **Analyze the PowerShell Script**  \n   - Examine the full script content (if available) for malicious payloads or obfuscation.  \n   - Check for **unusual registry modifications** or **file downloads** linked to the Temp file.\n\n3. **Audit \"Execute a Remote Command\" Events**  \n   - Correlate these events with network logs, authentication logs, and process creation events to identify **unauthorized remote access**.  \n   - Investigate if the `None` process field is due to **log gaps** or **malicious activity bypassing process monitoring**.\n\n4. **Check for Lateral Movement**  \n   - Use SIEM tools to detect **unusual network traffic** (e.g., connections to external IPs, C2 servers) around the time of these events.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis batch of logs contains **clear signs of potential malicious activity**, including **privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, and unexplained remote commands**. Immediate investigation is required to determine if this is a **breach or false positive**."}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's a legitimate Windows process, but sometimes attackers use it for malicious activities. However, just one event like that might not be enough.\n\nThen there are multiple entries for svchost.exe setting registry values. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and changing registry values isn't necessarily bad. But if it's happening repeatedly, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't show any obvious malicious changes here.\n\nThere's also a process with no name executing a remote command. That's suspicious because if the process is unknown, it might be a sign of something bad. But there are two instances of that, which might be normal or could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking at powershell.exe creating files. PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute scripts, but creating files in user directories like AppData might be normal. However, the filenames here don't seem to be malicious. Also, the user is creating a file called \"entrada_principal.txt\" which is just a regular text file.\n\nChrome.exe is involved in several events, including loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate files related to Windows Defender, so that's probably normal behavior. Chrome also does a lot of DNS queries, which is expected for a browser.\n\nThere's a winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its normal operation. The paths mentioned are in the Downloads directory, which is typical for user-installed software.\n\nOverall, while there are some suspicious elements like the unknown process executing remote commands and multiple registry changes, none of the events clearly indicate a security breach. The majority of the logs seem to be normal system activities. However, the repeated registry changes and the unknown process might warrant further investigation. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity, I'd classify this as not interesting. The confidence is around 0.4 because there are a few red flags but nothing conclusive.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The logs contain routine system activities (e.g., Chrome DNS queries, PowerShell file creation, Winlogbeat configuration updates) and no clear indicators of compromise. While there are repeated registry changes and an unknown process executing remote commands, these alone are not sufficient to confirm malicious activity without additional context.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
