Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are several entries with the process command line involving PowerShell scripts. They all seem to be creating scheduled tasks using the Register-ScheduledTask command. The tasks are set to run calc.exe at logon, which is suspicious because calc.exe is usually a harmless calculator, but in this context, it's being used as a payload. The scheduled tasks are registered under different names like \"unidade_ativo\", \"registro_geral\", etc. The user group is BUILTIN\\Administrators with RunLevel Highest, which means they have high privileges. That's a red flag because creating scheduled tasks with admin rights can be part of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.\n\nThen there are entries where PowerShell is involved in registry value sets and process accesses. The ImageLoad events mention loading mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. While these are legitimate, the combination with the scheduled tasks might indicate that the attacker is using .NET to execute more complex scripts or payloads.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any actual malicious activity beyond just creating scheduled tasks. The fact that multiple scheduled tasks are created with the same pattern, all triggering calc.exe, might be a test or a red herring. But in a real attack scenario, using calc.exe as a payload is often a sign of a staged attack where the real payload is hidden elsewhere. However, in these logs, there's no mention of downloading additional files or connecting to external IPs, which are more definitive signs of malware.\n\nThe presence of multiple similar events with the same structure suggests automation or a script that's generating these tasks. The use of PowerShell for creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges is a common technique in attacks. Even though calc.exe is benign, the method here is concerning because it's using scheduled tasks to execute it, which could be a way to maintain persistence or execute other commands later.\n\nThe confidence level would be high because the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights using PowerShell is a known malicious behavior. Even though calc.exe is not a malware, the context here is suspicious. However, there's no direct evidence of malicious payloads beyond the scheduled task creation. So, it's a strong indicator but not 100% certain. The justification would focus on the repeated creation of high-privilege scheduled tasks with PowerShell, which is a common attack vector.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) for BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, all triggering calc.exe execution at logon.

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, so first, I need to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about 'powershell.exe' loading various DLLs like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are all legitimate Windows and .NET files, so that's probably normal. But then there's a file created and deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_f5ji0z2p.gde.ps1. Creating and deleting a script file might be part of a test or temporary operation, but it's something to note.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event with no file involved. Not sure about that yet. Then, the command line for powershell.exe shows a scheduled task being created to run calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group having highest privileges. That's suspicious because creating a scheduled task with such permissions could be a way to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. The command line uses New-ScheduledTaskAction and Register-ScheduledTask, which are PowerShell cmdlets. This seems like a potential malicious activity, even though calc.exe is a legitimate program, the context here might be different.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome updating its own registry settings is normal, but the repetition might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The rest of the entries are about 'None' processes executing remote commands. That's concerning because if there's no process associated with those events, it might indicate something like a service or a remote execution without a clear process owner, which could be a sign of a vulnerability exploit or a remote code execution attack.\n\nPutting this all together: the PowerShell events, especially the scheduled task creation, are a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The remote command executions without a process are also suspicious. Even though some events are normal (like loading .NET DLLs or Chrome registry changes), the combination of the scheduled task and the remote commands makes this batch interesting for further investigation. The confidence is medium because while some events are benign, the presence of potential privilege escalation and remote execution attempts warrants closer look.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges to execute calc.exe at logon, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and numerous 'Execute a Remote Command' events with no associated process. These patterns suggest potential privilege escalation or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nMost of the entries have \"Execute a Remote Command\" in the winlog task. That's a red flag because executing remote commands can be part of an attack, like someone trying to run malicious code. But there are a lot of them, and some might be normal. Wait, but the process is \"None\" for many of them. That could mean the event wasn't associated with a specific process, which might be a data collection issue or maybe the attack is obfuscating the process.\n\nThen there's an entry with powershell.exe running a command to create a scheduled task. The command uses New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common example, but the trigger is at logon, and the principal is Administrators with high privileges. That seems suspicious because creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be an attempt to persist access. The file path for the task is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum\" which might be a custom name, but not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nAnother entry shows WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. WmiPrvSE is the Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service, and taskschd.dll is part of Task Scheduler. Loading that DLL might be normal, but in the context of other events, maybe it's part of an exploit.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value sets by svchost.exe. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but if it's setting registry values, that could be part of a configuration change or something more malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe File created events include entries for a PowerShell startup profile and a file named \"entrada_principal.txt\" which might be a log or data file. The winlogbeat file creation is probably part of a legitimate monitoring tool, so that's less concerning.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe entries, they're loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface and the Microsoft Defender Platform. Loading these DLLs is normal for Chrome, especially if it's interacting with the system's security features. But the registry events from chrome.exe might be less common and could indicate some kind of interaction or exploit attempt.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the repeated \"Execute a Remote Command\" events, the PowerShell scheduled task creation with admin privileges, and the unusual registry activity. However, some of these events might be false positives or part of legitimate system operations. The confidence isn't extremely high because some events could be benign, but the combination of multiple suspicious activities does warrant further investigation. So I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity, including repeated 'Execute a Remote Command' tasks, PowerShell creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, and suspicious file\/path interactions (e.g., 'taskschd.dll' loading, registry modifications by svchost.exe).

{"file":"data\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. So, first, looking at the data. All the events are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nThe first eight entries are all about chrome.exe performing a registry value set under the RegistryEvent rule. That's a lot of the same process doing the same action. Now, chrome.exe is a common browser, but modifying the registry could be suspicious. However, sometimes legitimate activities involve registry changes. But repeating the same action multiple times might indicate something else, like a script or malware trying to alter settings.\n\nThen, the ninth event is another registry value set, but the process is winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, part of the Elastic Stack. If it's creating a file in the Downloads directory, that might be normal, but the file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new. Maybe it's part of configuration, but the event is a FileCreate. Not sure yet.\n\nThe tenth event is powershell.exe creating a file called objeto_auxiliar.txt. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but creating a file named \"objeto_auxiliar\" (which translates to \"auxiliary object\" in Spanish) might be benign. However, if this is part of a larger set of activities, like downloading or executing something, it could be suspicious. But on its own, it's not necessarily malicious.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are chrome.exe modifying the registry multiple times. That's unusual. Chrome typically doesn't modify the registry that much unless there's a specific reason. If this is part of a legitimate user action, maybe, but repeated registry changes could be a sign of persistence mechanisms or malware trying to alter system settings. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. The other events involve winlogbeat and powershell creating files, which might be normal operations. But the high frequency of chrome.exe's registry events is a red flag. \n\nAnother thing to note: the user might be running a legitimate process that's causing these changes, but the repetition and the same process doing the same action multiple times could be a sign of something automated. Also, the presence of winlogbeat and powershell could indicate monitoring or administrative tasks, but combined with the chrome.exe events, it's a mix. \n\nHowever, the justification for classification as \"interesting\" would be the repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe, which is not typical. The confidence might be around 0.7 because while it's suspicious, there's not enough information to confirm malicious intent. But if the system is under monitoring, this could be a sign worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe (8 events) could indicate suspicious behavior, as Chrome typically does not perform frequent registry writes. Additional file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe may suggest monitoring or administrative activity, but combined with the chrome.exe pattern, this warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
