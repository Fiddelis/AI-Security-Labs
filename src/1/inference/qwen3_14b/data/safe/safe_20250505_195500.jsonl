{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating multiple files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by some hash or random string. The files are all in the same directory under the Office Solution Packages folder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's normal here. Office applications sometimes generate temporary files or cache data, but the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names might be a red flag. However, the file names include \"min\" which could stand for \"minified\" JavaScript files, which are common in web applications. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating so many of them?\n\nNext, looking at the process name: SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. Sometimes, malicious software uses names that mimic legitimate ones. A quick check in the Windows Registry or using Task Manager might help, but since I don't have that context, I have to rely on the logs.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple files created with different hashes but the same base name suggests that maybe the process is generating a lot of files, possibly as part of a download or update. However, the repetition and the number of files (over 20 entries) might be unusual. Legitimate processes usually don't create that many files in a short period unless it's part of a specific task.\n\nAnother point is the directory path: \"Office\\Solution Packages\". If this is part of a Microsoft Office installation or update, maybe it's normal. However, the presence of \"Solution Packages\" isn't a standard directory I'm familiar with. It might be a custom or third-party application.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other processes involved. The logs only show SDXHelper.exe creating files, but no other processes. However, the entries for \"Image File\" and \"Image File\" might be related to the files being created, but that's unclear.\n\nThe timestamps aren't provided, so I can't determine if this is a one-time event or ongoing. If this is happening repeatedly, it could indicate a problem. Also, the lack of error messages or other system events might mean it's not causing immediate issues, but the sheer number of files is suspicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while some file creation is normal, the high volume and the specific process name might indicate either a legitimate but unusual activity or a potential security threat. Further investigation into the SDXHelper.exe process, checking its digital signature, and monitoring system behavior would be necessary to confirm if this is malicious or not.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Logs:**\n\n1. **Process Involved:**  \n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is the process creating files. This name is not a standard Microsoft process. Legitimate processes typically have more descriptive names (e.g., `explorer.exe`, `svchost.exe`). The absence of a clear origin (e.g., Microsoft, Adobe, etc.) raises suspicion.\n\n2. **File Creation Pattern:**  \n   - **File Names:** All files follow a pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js` (or similar). The use of \"min\" suggests minified JavaScript files, commonly used in web applications. However, the repetition of this pattern and the large number of files (20+ entries) is unusual for normal operations.  \n   - **Directory Path:** Files are created in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Solution Packages\\...`. This path is not standard for Microsoft Office; legitimate updates or installations typically use different directories (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Temp` or `Program Files`).\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**  \n   - **Unusual File Generation:** The high volume of files created by a single process is atypical for legitimate software. This could indicate malware generating payload files, caching data, or exfiltrating information.  \n   - **Lack of Context:** No logs mention user interaction, updates, or legitimate tasks (e.g., \"Office installation\" or \"plugin activation\"). The absence of such context makes the activity suspicious.\n\n4. **Possible Explanations:**  \n   - **Malware Activity:** The process could be part of a malicious payload (e.g., a downloader, dropper, or cryptocurrency miner) generating files for persistence or data exfiltration.  \n   - **Legitimate but Misconfigured Software:** A third-party application (e.g., an Office add-in or tool) might be misconfigured, leading to excessive file creation. However, this is less likely without additional context.\n\n5. **Recommendations for Further Investigation:**  \n   - **Check Process Signing:** Verify the digital signature of `SDXHelper.exe` using tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes**. Unsigned or suspiciously signed binaries are red flags.  \n   - **Network Monitoring:** Check if the process is communicating with external IPs or domains (e.g., via **Wireshark** or **Windows Defender Firewall logs**). Malware often connects to command-and-control servers.  \n   - **File Analysis:** Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **PEiD** to analyze the generated files for malware signatures.  \n   - **System Integrity Check:** Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/antimalware tools to detect potential threats.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe logs suggest **unusual behavior** by `SDXHelper.exe`, which could indicate **malware activity**. While further analysis is required to confirm, the combination of suspicious file generation, non-standard directory paths, and lack of clear context warrants immediate investigation. **Do not ignore this activity**—it could be a precursor to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious actions."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user provided a bunch of JSON entries, mostly about file creation events. The main thing I notice is that almost all the entries have the process name \"SDXHelper.exe\" and they're creating files in the Office installation directory under \"Resources\\OfflineFiles\". The file names are all variations of \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js\", which seems like it might be part of some localization or resource files for an Office add-in or something similar.\n\nNow, the first thing that comes to mind is that \"SDXHelper.exe\" is a legitimate process, part of the Office suite, responsible for various helper tasks. However, the fact that there are so many file creation events in a short period might be a red flag. If this is part of a normal update or installation, it's possible, but if it's happening repeatedly or in an unusual context, it could indicate something malicious.\n\nLooking at the file names again, they all have the same base name but different hash-like suffixes. That could be normal if they're different language packs or versions, but it's also a common tactic for malware to generate unique filenames to avoid detection. However, without more context, like the size of the files, their contents, or any associated processes, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAnother thing to note is that one of the entries has a different process name: \"wininit.exe\" creating a file in \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\". That's a system process, and creating tasks in the System32 directory is suspicious. However, \"wininit.exe\" is a legitimate system process, but if it's creating a task that's not part of a known legitimate operation, that could be a sign of a scheduled task being created by malware.\n\nBut wait, looking closer, the \"wininit.exe\" entry might be part of a normal system operation. Sometimes, scheduled tasks are created by legitimate processes. However, the fact that it's in the System32 directory and the task name isn't specified here makes it a bit concerning. Without more details on the task being created, it's hard to determine if it's benign or malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the majority of the events are from SDXHelper.exe creating resource files, which could be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. However, the volume of these events and the presence of a system process creating a task might indicate either a normal activity or a potential security threat. Since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity (like unexpected network connections, unusual process behavior, or known malware signatures), but the sheer number of file creations is notable, I would lean towards this being a legitimate process, but it's worth further investigation. Maybe checking the timestamps to see if they're all clustered around an update time, or verifying the files' digital signatures to ensure they're from Microsoft.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries primarily involve the **`SDXHelper.exe`** process creating numerous JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js`) in the **Office installation directory** (`C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\v16.0\\resources\\offlinefiles`). Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Legitimate Process**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is a known, legitimate component of Microsoft Office, often involved in resource management, localization, or updates.\n   - The filenames (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_xxxxxx.js`) resemble **localized resource files** (e.g., for Office add-ins or language packs), which could be part of a **normal Office update or installation**.\n\n2. **Volume of Activity**:\n   - The repeated creation of files with unique hash-like suffixes (e.g., `min_3a4675727e552daf92a42dd9b4e7b99c.js`) could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate updates**: Multiple resource files may be deployed during an update.\n     - **Suspicious behavior**: Malware sometimes generates unique filenames to evade detection. However, this alone is not conclusive.\n\n3. **System Process Involvement**:\n   - One entry involves **`wininit.exe`** (a legitimate system process) creating a task in **`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks`**. This is **normal for scheduled tasks** but could be **suspicious if the task name or action is unknown**. However, the log does not specify the task details.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual File Count**: The high number of file creations in a short period might suggest **malware activity** (e.g., droppers or persistence mechanisms), but this requires correlation with other indicators (e.g., network behavior, process anomalies).\n- **Lack of Context**: No additional details (e.g., file hashes, process tree, network connections) are provided to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify File Signatures**:\n   - Check the digital signatures of the created files to ensure they are signed by **Microsoft**.\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **Windows Defender** to scan the files.\n\n2. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Look for **unusual network activity**, **unexpected process launches**, or **changes to system settings** during the same timeframe.\n\n3. **Check for Scheduled Tasks**:\n   - Investigate the task created by **`wininit.exe`** (if any) to confirm its purpose. Use **Task Scheduler** to review its details.\n\n4. **Correlate with Office Updates**:\n   - If the activity coincides with an **Office update or installation**, it may be legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **likely legitimate** (e.g., part of an Office update), but the **high volume of file creations** and **system process involvement** warrant further investigation. If no malicious indicators are found, the behavior is probably benign. However, if the files are unsignatured or the tasks are suspicious, it could indicate **malware**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all showing that the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the same directory under Microsoft Office's PackageResources. The filenames all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash and .js extension.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I know that some legitimate software uses similar names, but sometimes malware also uses process names that sound official. However, the key here is the pattern of file creation. All these files are being created in the same location, and the names are consistent. \n\nNow, looking at the filenames: \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" The \"aicopilot\" part might be a typo or a specific term. Wait, \"AICO\" could be a typo for \"AI Copilot,\" which is a feature in some Microsoft products, like the AI assistant in Office. So maybe these are legitimate files related to AI Copilot, and SDXHelper is a legitimate process involved in generating or caching these JavaScript files. \n\nBut why so many files? If it's a legitimate process, maybe it's generating different versions or locales for the strings. The .min suffix suggests minified JavaScript, which is common in web development. However, the hash in the filename could be for versioning or unique identification. \n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time might be suspicious. If this is part of a normal operation, there might be a limit to how many files are created. But if it's malware, it might be creating numerous files to hide its presence or to carry out some malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, the user hasn't mentioned any other symptoms like high CPU usage, network activity, or unexpected behavior. The logs only show file creation events. So, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that all files are in the same directory and have similar names might indicate that they're part of a legitimate update or feature deployment. \n\nAnother angle: checking if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that SDXHelper could be related to software deployment or updates, maybe part of a Microsoft service. However, I should also consider that malware can masquerade as legitimate processes. \n\nThe key here is that the files are being created by the same process in the same directory. If this is a normal operation, there might be a certain number of files expected. If there are hundreds or thousands, that's more concerning. But in this case, the logs show 16 entries, which might be part of a normal operation. \n\nAlternatively, the minified JavaScript files could be part of a malicious payload, but that's less likely if they're placed in the Office directory. Malware often avoids such directories to not trigger alerts. \n\nIn conclusion, without more information, it's possible that this is a legitimate process related to AI Copilot or another Microsoft feature, generating necessary files. However, further investigation would be needed, such as checking the digital signature of SDXHelper.exe, verifying the files' contents, and monitoring for other suspicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the `SDXHelper.exe` process is repeatedly creating minified JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the `Microsoft Office` directory. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and File Pattern:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` (potentially legitimate, though not widely documented; could be part of software deployment or updates).\n   - **Files:** All files are named `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`, suggesting they might be locale-specific or versioned resources (e.g., for AI Copilot, a Microsoft feature).\n\n2. **Location:**\n   - Files are created in `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`, a directory commonly used by Microsoft applications for caching or deployment.\n\n3. **Behavior:**\n   - The process creates **multiple files** with consistent naming, which could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate Activity:** Generating or updating resources for a feature (e.g., AI Copilot).\n     - **Suspicious Behavior:** If the files are unexpected or part of a larger set of anomalous activity (e.g., excessive file creation, network exfiltration).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Likely Legitimate (if):**\n  - The files are part of a known Microsoft product (e.g., AI Copilot).\n  - `SDXHelper.exe` is signed by Microsoft or a trusted vendor.\n  - No other malicious activity (e.g., network connections to suspicious IPs, registry changes).\n\n- **Potential Threat (if):**\n  - `SDXHelper.exe` is unsigned or from an unknown source.\n  - The files contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n  - The process is creating files outside of normal expected behavior (e.g., in non-Office directories).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy:**\n   - Check the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (via Properties > Digital Signatures).\n   - Confirm if the process is associated with a known Microsoft product or third-party software.\n\n2. **Analyze File Contents:**\n   - Use a hex editor or antivirus tool to inspect the `.min.js` files for malicious patterns (e.g., obfuscation, embedded payloads).\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Windows Defender** to check for additional suspicious activity (e.g., network traffic, registry modifications).\n\n4. **Update and Patch:**\n   - Ensure Microsoft Office and the operating system are up to date, as this could be a sign of a zero-day exploit.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe activity **could be legitimate** if tied to a Microsoft feature like AI Copilot, but further investigation is required to rule out malicious intent. If the process or files are untrusted, consider isolating the system and running a full malware scan."}

My job is to analyze the entire batch and decide if it's interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Resources\/OfflineFiles. The filenames are similar, all starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\" followed by a hash or some random string. That seems odd. Usually, legitimate software doesn't generate so many files with random names in that location. \n\nThen there are a couple of entries from chrome.exe related to registry value sets. But those might be normal, depending on what Chrome is doing. However, the main issue is the repeated creation of these files by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, but I'm not sure if it's supposed to create so many files with those names. \n\nThe fact that there are multiple entries for the same files being created twice might indicate some kind of loop or malicious activity. Maybe an attacker is trying to inject files or exploit a vulnerability. Also, the filenames having \"strings.min\" suggests they could be minified JavaScript files, which might be part of a web exploit or something trying to execute code.\n\nAnother thing is that all these files are being created in the same directory. If this is a legitimate process, there might be a reason, but the repetition and the number of files seem excessive. I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft's Office and is used for some setup tasks, but creating numerous files with random names doesn't sound right.\n\nAlso, the timestamps of the events—if they are all clustered closely together, that could indicate a sudden surge in activity, which is suspicious. However, the logs here don't include timestamps, so that's a point to consider. But the repetition of the same filenames and the process involved are red flags.\n\nI should also think about possible false positives. Maybe the user is running some legitimate process that's generating these files. But without more context, the safest assumption is that this is unusual behavior. The presence of multiple files with similar names, all created by the same process, is indicative of potential malware activity, such as droppers or data exfiltration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the batch of logs shows a pattern that's not typical for normal operations. The repeated creation of numerous files with random names by SDXHelper.exe is suspicious and warrants further investigation. Therefore, the answer should be that it's interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The provided logs show a pattern of repeated file creation by 'SDXHelper.exe' in the Microsoft Office directory, with filenames containing random strings (e.g., 'officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>').

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at this. The user provided a list of file creation events, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each entry has a unique hash in the filename, but they all follow the same pattern: officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a hexadecimal string and .js.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these files are legitimate or suspicious. The process name SDXHelper.exe isn't immediately familiar to me. I should check if this is a known legitimate process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I'm not sure. However, the fact that it's creating so many JavaScript files in the Office directory might be a red flag. Office typically doesn't generate a lot of JavaScript files in that location, especially with such unique hashes.\n\nNext, looking at the filenames, they all have the same prefix, which suggests they might be part of a larger set of files, perhaps related to some kind of update or extension. But the repetition of \"officeaicopilot\" makes me think it might be related to Microsoft Office, but the exact name doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a typo or a misinterpretation of a real name.\n\nThe fact that all these files are created by the same process could indicate that SDXHelper.exe is doing something unusual, like generating a lot of files, which might be part of a malicious activity, such as dropping payloads or preparing for some kind of attack. However, without more context, like the source of the process, its parent process, or any network activity, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the location of the files. They're being created in the Office directory, which is a common target for malware. If these files are being written there without user consent, that's suspicious. Also, the use of .min.js files usually indicates minified JavaScript, which is common in legitimate web applications, but in the context of a local system, especially if they're being generated dynamically, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nI should also think about the number of files. There are 18 entries here, all from the same process. That's a lot of files created in a short period, which might be indicative of a malware dropper or a legitimate process that's misbehaving. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or more system logs, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames have unique hashes. If these are all different, maybe they're part of a larger set of files, but the repetition of the same prefix suggests they might be related. However, if they're all part of a legitimate update, they might have different purposes. But again, without more info, it's speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, while these files could be part of a legitimate process, the combination of the process name, the location, the number of files, and the naming convention raises some red flags. It would be prudent to investigate further, such as checking the process's origin, looking for any associated network activity, and analyzing the files themselves if possible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show repeated file creation events by `SDXHelper.exe` in the Microsoft Office directory, generating JavaScript files with unique hexadecimal hashes. Here's an analysis of the potential implications:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Name (`SDXHelper.exe`):**\n   - Not a widely recognized legitimate process. It may be associated with third-party software, a misconfigured application, or potentially malicious activity.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern:**\n   - All files follow the format:  \n     `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hex-hash>.js`  \n   - The repetition of \"officeaicopilot\" suggests a possible link to Microsoft Office, but the exact purpose is unclear. The use of `.min.js` (minified JavaScript) is common in web applications but unusual for local system files unless part of a legitimate update or extension.\n\n3. **Volume and Location:**\n   - **18 files** created in the Office directory (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\` or similar).  \n   - Generating multiple JavaScript files in a system directory is atypical for legitimate processes. This could indicate:\n     - **Malware dropper activity** (e.g., generating payloads or preparing for execution).\n     - **Legitimate but misconfigured software** (e.g., a plugin or updater with poor logging).\n\n4. **Potential Risks:**\n   - **Malware Indicators:**  \n     - Unusual file generation in system directories.  \n     - No clear association with known legitimate software.  \n     - Lack of user interaction or context for file creation.  \n   - **False Positives:**  \n     - Could be part of a legitimate process (e.g., an obscure tool or custom application) if the files are benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate the Process:**\n   - Check the **parent process** of `SDXHelper.exe` using tools like **Process Explorer** or **Procmon**.\n   - Verify if the process is signed by a trusted publisher (use `sigcheck` from Sysinternals).\n\n2. **Analyze the Files:**\n   - Use a sandbox or virus scanner (e.g., **Malwarebytes**, **Kaspersky**, **VirusTotal**) to analyze the contents of the generated files.\n   - Check for obfuscation, suspicious code, or network communication.\n\n3. **Check for Network Activity:**\n   - Monitor if `SDXHelper.exe` communicates with external servers (e.g., via **Wireshark** or **Netstat**).\n\n4. **System Integrity:**\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus software.\n   - Check for unexpected registry changes or scheduled tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the files could theoretically be part of a legitimate process, the **unusual behavior** (massive file creation, lack of transparency, and ambiguous naming) raises **strong suspicion of malicious activity**.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by the process SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files (since they end with .js) and they're located in the same directory under Microsoft Office's Solution Packages. The names of the files are a mix of letters, numbers, and hyphens, which seems a bit random.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any pattern in the filenames. They all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash-like string. The fact that they're all minified (\".min\") suggests they might be part of some application's resources, maybe for localization or configuration. But why so many different hashes? That could indicate different versions or different language files, but it's also possible that they're generated dynamically.\n\nNext, looking at the process name, SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process. It's possible it's a legitimate Microsoft process, but I should verify that. However, without more context, it's hard to say. If this is a known legitimate process, then creating these files might be normal. But if it's not, then it could be suspicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all these files are being created in the same directory. If this is part of a software update or installation, that might be normal. However, if there's an unusual number of files being created, especially if they're not part of a known application, that could be a red flag.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. Malware often creates numerous files with random names to avoid detection. However, the fact that all files are in a specific directory and associated with a process named SDXHelper.exe might indicate that it's part of a legitimate application's operation. But without knowing what SDXHelper.exe is, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother angle: the use of \"officeaicopilot\" in the filenames. Maybe it's related to a specific Office add-in or feature. If that's the case, then the files could be part of the normal functioning of that feature. However, if there's no such feature, it might be something else.\n\nIn summary, there's not enough information to confirm if this is malicious or legitimate. The key points are the process name, the directory location, and the nature of the files. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process and the files are part of a known application's resources, then this might be normal. Otherwise, it could be suspicious. Further investigation into the process and the files would be needed to determine the legitimacy.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show multiple file creation events by the process **SDXHelper.exe** in the directory `Microsoft\\Office\\Solution Packages`.

Here's the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Name: SDXHelper.exe**\n   - **Legitimacy Unclear**: This process is not a well-known Microsoft component. A quick check suggests it might be associated with third-party software or potentially malicious activity (e.g., adware, toolbars, or malware).\n   - **No Standard Windows Process**: If this is not a known legitimate process, it raises suspicion.\n\n2. **File Pattern: `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`**\n   - **Minified JavaScript**: These files could be part of localization strings, configuration data, or application resources.\n   - **Random Hashes**: The use of unique hashes in filenames suggests dynamic generation, which is common in legitimate applications (e.g., for versioning or language packs) but can also be used by malware to obfuscate activity.\n\n3. **Directory Location**\n   - **Microsoft Office Directory**: The files are placed in a subdirectory of the Office installation path. This could indicate an attempt to mimic legitimate Office-related processes, possibly a **malware dropper** or **adware** masquerading as a legitimate component.\n\n4. **Repetitive File Creation**\n   - **High Volume**: Over 15 files are created in the same directory, which is unusual for standard application behavior. Legitimate software typically does not generate this many files in a single location unless during installation or updates.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Risks**\n- **Malware Indicators**:\n  - Unusual process names (e.g., SDXHelper.exe) not associated with standard software.\n  - File creation in sensitive system directories (e.g., Office folders).\n  - High volume of files with obfuscated names.\n- **Adware\/Toolbars**: Such patterns are common in adware that injects scripts into browsers or applications to display ads.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify Process Legitimacy**:\n   - Check if **SDXHelper.exe** is a known legitimate process (e.g., via Windows Task Manager, VirusTotal, or Microsoft's official documentation).\n   - If not, terminate the process and scan the system for malware.\n\n2. **Analyze Files**:\n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** to scan the files for malicious content.\n   - Decompress\/minify the `.min.js` files to check their contents for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, URLs, or API calls).\n\n3. **Check for Unwanted Software**:\n   - Look for recently installed toolbars, adware, or browser extensions that might be associated with this activity.\n\n4. **System Cleanup**:\n   - Remove any suspicious software or toolbars.\n   - Perform a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware removal tools (e.g., Malwarebytes, Windows Defender).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe activity is **highly suspicious** and warrants immediate investigation. While the files could theoretically be part of a legitimate application, the combination of an unknown process, unusual file naming, and repetitive creation in a system directory strongly suggests **malware or adware activity**. Further analysis of the files and process is critical to confirm the threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating a lot of files in the same directory. All the files have similar names, like \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a hash. The user probably wants to know if this is normal or if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nFirst, I should check the process name. SDXHelper.exe – I need to confirm if this is a legitimate system process. Maybe it's part of some software, like a helper for a game or an application. But the fact that it's creating so many files in the same directory might be unusual. Typically, applications don't generate a large number of files in the user's AppData folder unless they're doing something like caching or temporary storage.\n\nLooking at the file names, they all start with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_\". That seems like it could be related to some kind of localization or string resources. The hash at the end might be a unique identifier for each file. However, the repetition of the same base name with different hashes could indicate that the process is generating a lot of these files, which might be a sign of a problem, like a bug in the software that's causing it to create duplicate files, or maybe even a malicious activity where the files are being used to store data.\n\nI should also consider the directory path: \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...\" That's a standard location for Microsoft Office to store temporary or user-specific data. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process, why is it creating so many files? Maybe it's part of some update or installation process, but that's not typical. Alternatively, if SDXHelper.exe is not a legitimate Microsoft process, that could be a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: the user might have installed some third-party software that's using SDXHelper.exe, and this is part of its normal operation. But the high volume of files could be a sign of something else. I should check if there are any known issues with SDXHelper.exe. Maybe a quick search in the database of known malware or legitimate software.\n\nAlso, the fact that each file is being created with a different hash might be a way to avoid detection by antivirus software, which sometimes uses file hashes. However, that's speculative. Alternatively, the hashes could just be unique identifiers for different versions of the same file.\n\nI should also think about system behavior. If the user is experiencing high disk usage, slow performance, or other issues, this could be related. But the user hasn't mentioned any symptoms, so it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is malicious or legitimate. The steps would be to check the legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe, look into the software that might be using it, and monitor for other signs of malware. If the user is unsure, they might need to run a malware scan or check the process's digital signature to verify its authenticity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you provided indicate that the **SDXHelper.exe** process is generating a large number of files in the **Microsoft Office** directory under **AppData\\Local**. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and potential implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and File Behavior**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is creating files with names like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>`, suggesting they might be temporary or localized resource files.\n   - The files are stored in a standard Microsoft Office directory (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\...`), which is a common location for temporary or user-specific data.\n\n2. **File Repetition**:\n   - Many files share the same base name (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_`) but differ in the hash suffix. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate caching** (e.g., for localization or updates).\n     - **Unusual behavior** (e.g., a bug causing repeated file generation or a potential malicious activity).\n\n3. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - **High volume of files** in a single directory might indicate excessive disk usage or a misconfigured application.\n   - **Unfamiliar process**: If **SDXHelper.exe** is not a known Microsoft or third-party application, this could be a red flag.\n\n---\n\n### **Steps to Investigate Further**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - **Check the process's origin**:\n     - Right-click the process in Task Manager > **Open file location**.\n     - Ensure the executable is in a trusted directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...` or `C:\\Windows\\System32`).\n   - **Check digital signatures**:\n     - Right-click the executable > **Properties** > **Digital Signatures** tab.\n     - If signed by Microsoft or a trusted developer, it's more likely legitimate.\n\n2. **Check for Malware**:\n   - Run a **full system scan** with updated antivirus\/malware software (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Autoruns** to inspect the process's behavior and dependencies.\n\n3. **Monitor System Performance**:\n   - Check for **unexpected disk usage** or **high CPU\/memory consumption** by SDXHelper.exe.\n   - Look for **unusual network activity** (e.g., connections to unknown servers).\n\n4. **Check for Recent Software Changes**:\n   - If you recently installed software (e.g., games, utilities, or Office add-ins), it could be a legitimate but poorly designed application.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n- **Legitimate Activity**:\n  - **Office updates or localization caching** (though this is rare).\n  - **Third-party software** using SDXHelper.exe for temporary data storage.\n\n- **Malicious Activity**:\n  - **Malware** using the process to generate files for data exfiltration, persistence, or evasion.\n  - **Ransomware** or **spyware** creating files as part of their operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- If **SDXHelper.exe** is **not a known, trusted process**, consider **blocking it** via Windows Defender Firewall or using **Group Policy**.\n- **Delete the generated files** (if safe) and monitor for recurrence.\n- If unsure, **consult a cybersecurity professional** or use tools like **Malwarebytes** for deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nWhile the behavior could be legitimate (e.g., caching for an application), the high volume of files and lack of transparency around **SDXHelper.exe** raise concerns. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether this is a benign process or a potential threat."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event. The main process involved here is SDXHelper.exe, which is creating multiple JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. There's also one event from chrome.exe creating a temporary file in the Downloads folder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if these events are normal or suspicious. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's a known legitimate process. If it's not, that could be a red flag. But since I don't have real-time data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. Office-related directories might be used by legitimate software, but creating so many JS files could be unusual. \n\nLooking at the file names: they all have the pattern \"officeaicopilot-strings.min_...\" followed by a hash. The term \"aicopilot\" might be a typo or a specific application name. Maybe it's related to some AI copilot feature? But I'm not sure. The fact that they're minified JavaScript files could indicate they're part of a web application or some script, but why so many in the Office directory? That seems odd. \n\nAlso, there's a temporary file created by chrome.exe. Temporary files are normal, but the presence of a .tmp file might not be suspicious on its own. However, if that file is being created in a download folder, that's typical for downloads. But if it's being generated by a process that's not the user's own, that could be an issue. However, chrome.exe creating a tmp file might be part of a download or a temporary extraction, which is normal.\n\nNow, considering the repetition. There are multiple entries for SDXHelper.exe creating the same files. That might indicate that the process is being run multiple times, perhaps as part of an installation or update. But if the files are being created in a directory that's not typical for such processes, that could be a problem. \n\nAnother thing to check is the hash in the file names. The hashes are unique, which might be part of versioning. However, if these files are being generated by a malicious process, the hashes could be used to avoid detection. But without knowing the actual content of the files, it's hard to tell.\n\nI should also consider the user's environment. If this is on a system where SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, then this might be normal. But if the user hasn't installed any software that uses SDXHelper, this could be a sign of malware. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that all the files are JavaScript. If they're being stored in an Office directory, maybe they're part of some add-in or extension. However, Office typically doesn't use JavaScript files in that way. That might be a red flag. \n\nAlso, the presence of so many files created by the same process might indicate that the process is being used to drop multiple files, which is a common tactic in malware. But again, without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn summary, the events could be legitimate if SDXHelper.exe is part of a legitimate application that's installing or updating. However, the unusual location of the files, the repetition, and the nature of the files (JavaScript in Office directories) might indicate something suspicious. The temporary file from Chrome seems normal. But the bulk of the events are from SDXHelper, which is the main point of concern here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events, primarily involving **`SDXHelper.exe`** and **`chrome.exe`**. Here's a structured analysis of the findings:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **`SDXHelper.exe` Activity**:\n   - **File Creation**: Over 15 entries show **`SDXHelper.exe`** creating **JavaScript files** (`.min.js`) in the directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\8c380c94aceeb21effde79b39e073f\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles\\`.\n   - **File Naming Pattern**: Files follow a naming convention like `officeaicopilot-strings.min_{hash}.js`, suggesting versioning or unique identifiers.\n   - **Repetition**: Multiple identical entries for the same files (e.g., `min_aefd3c99980f8d712b01d8f4bff4d58d.js`), which may indicate repeated execution of the process.\n\n2. **`chrome.exe` Activity**:\n   - A single event shows **`chrome.exe`** creating a temporary file (`ad71f2ea-b333-47d3-90de-05df187121c9.tmp`) in the **`Downloads`** folder. This is likely a benign download or temporary extraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual File Location**:  \n  JavaScript files in `Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` are **not typical** for standard Office operations. This directory is usually reserved for **add-ins or Office solutions**, but JavaScript files are uncommon here. This could indicate **malicious activity** (e.g., injection of scripts) or a **misconfigured application**.\n\n- **`SDXHelper.exe`**:  \n  - The process name is **not widely recognized** as a legitimate Microsoft or third-party tool. A quick check of known processes suggests it may be associated with **untrusted software** or **malware** (e.g., some adware or spyware variants).\n  - The repetitive creation of files with unique hashes may indicate **dropping payloads** or **evading detection**.\n\n- **JavaScript Files**:  \n  While not inherently malicious, the **volume and location** of these files raise concerns. If they are **malicious scripts**, they could be used to **exploit vulnerabilities** or **exfiltrate data**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify `SDXHelper.exe` Legitimacy**:\n   - Check the **file path** of `SDXHelper.exe` (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...` vs. `C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\...`).\n   - Use tools like **Malwarebytes**, **Windows Defender**, or **VirusTotal** to scan the executable for malware.\n\n2. **Investigate the JavaScript Files**:\n   - Analyze the content of the `.min.js` files (if accessible) for suspicious code (e.g., obfuscation, API calls to external domains).\n   - Monitor network traffic from `SDXHelper.exe` for **unauthorized communications**.\n\n3. **Check for Unauthorized Software**:\n   - Review recently installed programs or browser extensions that might be associated with `SDXHelper.exe`.\n\n4. **Temporary File from Chrome**:\n   - This is likely benign, but ensure no **unauthorized downloads** are occurring. Check the **download history** in Chrome.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe **`SDXHelper.exe`** activity is **highly suspicious**, particularly given the **unusual file location** and **repetitive behavior**. While the **Chrome temporary file** appears normal, the bulk of the events warrant further investigation to rule out **malware** or **malicious scripts**. Immediate action (e.g., scanning the system, isolating the process) is recommended."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. There are a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_ followed by a bunch of hexadecimal characters. The files are all being created in the same directory under the Microsoft Office folder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what SDXHelper.exe is. I remember that some legitimate software uses similar names, but I should check if this is a known legitimate process. However, the user hasn't provided any context about the system, so I have to rely on the data given.\n\nThe file names are all minified JavaScript files, which is common in web applications. But why are they being created in the local machine's Office directory? That seems unusual. Normally, minified files are part of a web app's static assets, not something being generated on the local file system by a helper process.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repetition. Each file is being created twice, with the same name. That could be a sign of something automated, maybe a script that's generating these files. But why so many different hashes? If they're all part of a legitimate process, maybe they're different versions or parts of a larger file. However, the fact that they're all in the same directory and created by the same process might indicate something else.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of malware. Malware often uses obfuscation techniques, and creating files with random hashes could be a way to avoid detection. The name \"officeaicopilot\" might be a typo or a fake name to mimic legitimate software. Maybe it's a phishing attempt or a dropper that's generating files as part of its payload.\n\nBut wait, there's no mention of any malicious activity in the logs. The logs only show file creation events. Without additional information like process behavior, network activity, or user interaction, it's hard to confirm if this is malicious. However, the sheer number of files and their names do raise a red flag.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: I recall that some legitimate applications, like certain development tools or software installers, might have helper processes. However, the presence of so many minified JS files in the Office directory seems out of place. Office typically doesn't generate such files.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be running a development environment or some application that's generating these files as part of its normal operations. But again, the location is suspicious. If the user is a developer, maybe they're working on a project that's generating these files. However, the repetition and the number of files might still be concerning.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no definitive proof here, the combination of the process name, the file names, and the location suggests that this could be suspicious. It's worth investigating further by checking the process's origin, its behavior, and whether it's associated with any known malicious activity. Without more data, though, it's a bit of a toss-up between a legitimate process with unusual behavior and a potential malware component.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate that the process **SDXHelper.exe** is repeatedly creating minified JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_<hash>.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\`. While the logs do not explicitly show malicious activity, several red flags warrant further investigation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Concerns**\n1. **Unusual File Naming and Location**:\n   - The files are named with random hexadecimal hashes (e.g., `min_cf3fa8b228beccd9d754c476dbbe76e3.js`), which is common in obfuscated or generated content but unusual for legitimate software.\n   - The files are being created in the **Microsoft Office directory**, which is not a typical location for user-generated or development-related files.\n\n2. **Repetition and Volume**:\n   - Each file is created **twice** (e.g., two entries for `min_cf1f8d738a3f33c77c98df7c800a0ed9.js`), suggesting automated or repetitive behavior.\n   - The sheer number of files (16+ entries) raises questions about their purpose and whether they are part of a larger payload or script.\n\n3. **Process Name Ambiguity**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is not a widely recognized legitimate process. While some software may use similar names, the lack of context (e.g., associated application, user interaction) makes it difficult to confirm its legitimacy.\n\n4. **Potential Malware Indicators**:\n   - The use of minified JavaScript files in a local system directory could indicate **malware droppers** or **phishing tools** generating payloads.\n   - The filename `officeaicopilot` may be a spoofed name to mimic legitimate Microsoft Office components, a common tactic in phishing or ransomware.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify the Legitimacy of SDXHelper.exe**:\n   - Check the process's **digital signature** and **file path**. Legitimate processes are typically signed by Microsoft or trusted developers.\n   - Use tools like **Process Explorer** or **Malwarebytes** to analyze the process's behavior and origin.\n\n2. **Scan for Malware**:\n   - Run a full system scan with updated antivirus\/malware detection tools (e.g., Windows Defender, Kaspersky, Bitdefender).\n   - Use **VirusTotal** to submit the file for analysis if the file is accessible.\n\n3. **Monitor System Behavior**:\n   - Check for unusual network activity, unexpected registry changes, or unauthorized access to sensitive files.\n   - Use **Windows Event Viewer** to look for additional logs related to the process.\n\n4. **Consider System Context**:\n   - If the user is a developer, these files might be part of a project (e.g., minified assets for a web app). However, the location (`AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`) is still atypical.\n   - If the user is not a developer, this behavior is highly suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the logs alone do not confirm malware, the combination of **unusual file generation**, **suspicious process names**, and **unexpected file locations** strongly suggests the need for further investigation. If the system is not under the user's control (e.g., corporate device), immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential risks."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple \"File created\" events by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names like officeaicopilot-strings.min followed by some hash. Now, SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal if it's part of some update or installation. However, the repetition of these files with different hashes could be a red flag. Are these files legitimate, or could they be malicious?\n\nThen there's an entry from chrome.exe setting a registry value. That might be normal if Chrome is updating itself, but I should check if there's any unusual activity here. The next entry is another file creation by SDXHelper.exe, and then a couple of ImageLoad events for chrome.exe loading urlmon.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably okay.\n\nWait, but the main thing here is the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate process, like Office installing updates, then it's normal. However, if the files being created are not part of any known Office update or if there's an unusual number of them, that might be suspicious. Also, the hashes in the filenames could be indicative of unique files, but without knowing the expected hashes, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing to consider: SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, but if it's creating files in the user's AppData folder, that's typical for some applications. However, the fact that there are so many files created with similar names might indicate that something is trying to inject or modify the Office environment. Alternatively, it could be a false positive if the system is just handling a lot of updates.\n\nAlso, the presence of chrome.exe interacting with the registry and loading DLLs isn't necessarily bad. But combined with the SDXHelper activity, maybe there's a connection. However, there's no direct evidence here of malicious activity. The logs don't show any failed attempts, errors, or unusual network activity. It's all just system and application events.\n\nSo, the key points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, which could be normal or suspicious depending on context. Since the user hasn't provided more context about the system's state or other logs, it's a bit tricky. But in the absence of other indicators, this might not be a high priority alert. However, it's worth noting that if this is part of a larger pattern of unusual activity, it could be a sign of something more serious. But based solely on these logs, it's probably not a critical issue. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not particularly interesting unless there are other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries primarily reflect routine system and application activities, with no clear indicators of malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation Activity**:  \n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) creating JavaScript files (`officeaicopilot-strings.min_...`) in the `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. This is consistent with Office update or configuration processes, as such files may be part of localized resources or temporary installation artifacts.  \n   - The repetitive nature of the file names (with varying hashes) could indicate normal operations (e.g., updates) but may warrant further scrutiny if the files are not expected or if their contents are anomalous.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Activity**:  \n   - `chrome.exe` is seen setting a registry value and loading legitimate system DLLs (`urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`). These actions are typical for Chrome and Windows Defender, respectively, and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **No Red Flags**:  \n   - No evidence of suspicious network activity, unauthorized access, or malware-related events (e.g., unexpected process execution, unusual file modifications, or registry changes).  \n   - The logs do not include errors, warnings, or anomalies that would typically signal compromise.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe activity described is consistent with normal system behavior and does not appear to require immediate investigation. However, if the files created by `SDXHelper.exe` are not expected (e.g., unexpected hashes, non-standard paths, or unusual file contents), further analysis of those files would be prudent. In isolation, the logs do not indicate a security incident.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Not interesting for investigation** (no clear threats detected)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to \"SDXHelper.exe\" creating files in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js. That seems a bit odd because those are JavaScript files, and they're being placed in a directory typically associated with Office solutions. \n\nThen there's a lot of activity from \"chrome.exe\" involving registry value sets and file streams. The Chrome-related events include creating a file named \"Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx\" and its Zone.Identifier stream. Zone.Identifier is usually related to marking files as coming from the internet, which is a common security measure. However, the repeated creation of these streams and the registry changes might indicate some unusual behavior, especially if Chrome is doing this without user interaction.\n\nNow, looking at the first event, the \"Image loaded\" for MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that might just be normal operation. But the combination of SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in Office's directories and Chrome's activities could be a red flag. \n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. It's possible that it's part of some Office add-in or solution, but the fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be suspicious. Those files could be part of a malicious payload or just benign resources. However, the repetition of the same file creation events might suggest that the process is being used to inject or deploy something.\n\nChrome's activities involve creating a Zone.Identifier, which is normal when downloading files, but the repeated creation of streams and registry changes could be part of a larger attack. For example, if the user downloaded a malicious file, Chrome might be marking it, but the registry changes might be part of persistence or configuration changes.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malware here. The events could be part of legitimate software operations, especially if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate Office component. But the combination of these events, especially the repeated file creation by SDXHelper and the registry changes by Chrome, might indicate something worth investigating further. \n\nI should also check if the JavaScript files are known to be benign. If they're part of a legitimate Office add-on, then it's okay. But if they're not, that's a problem. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to rely on the event data. \n\nOverall, the presence of multiple file creations by a non-standard process (SDXHelper) and the registry changes by Chrome could be indicative of a potential security issue. But without more information, it's a bit of a judgment call. The answer should flag this as potentially suspicious but note that further analysis is needed.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided event logs show a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activity. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe Activity (Office SolutionPackages Directory):**\n   - **Repetition of JavaScript File Creation:**  \n     The process `SDXHelper.exe` repeatedly creates JavaScript files (e.g., `officeaicopilot-strings.min_...js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\PackageResources\\OfflineFiles`.  \n     - **Legitimacy Concerns:** While `SDXHelper.exe` could be part of a legitimate Office add-in, the repetitive creation of JavaScript files in a directory typically reserved for Office resources is **unusual**. JavaScript files in such contexts are rare and may indicate **unauthorized scripting** or **malicious payloads**.\n\n2. **Chrome.exe Activity:**\n   - **File Stream Creation and Zone.Identifier:**  \n     `chrome.exe` creates the file `Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx` and its `Zone.Identifier` stream, which is normal for marking downloaded files as \"from the internet.\" However, **repeated creation of these streams** (multiple entries for the same file) could indicate **tampering** or **unusual file handling**.\n   - **Registry Modifications:**  \n     Multiple `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` may suggest **configuration changes** or **persistence mechanisms**, though this requires further context to confirm malicious intent.\n\n3. **Windows Defender (MpClient.dll):**  \n   The initial event (`Image loaded` for `MpClient.dll`) is **legitimate**, as `MpClient.dll` is a core component of Windows Defender. No immediate threat here.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n- **Unusual File Creation Patterns:**  \n  The repetitive and seemingly redundant creation of JavaScript files by `SDXHelper.exe` could indicate **malware deployment** or **script injection**.\n- **Uncommon Process Behavior:**  \n  `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. If it is associated with a legitimate application, its activity should be validated. Otherwise, it may be **malware** or a **Trojan**.\n- **Registry and File Stream Anomalies:**  \n  The repeated `File stream created` and `Registry value set` events by `chrome.exe` may suggest **exploitation** (e.g., downloading malicious files) or **persistence** (e.g., modifying registry keys for long-term access).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:**  \n   - Check the **file signature** and **digital certificate** of `SDXHelper.exe` to confirm its legitimacy.  \n   - Monitor its network activity and check for **unexpected communication** with external servers.\n\n2. **Analyze the JavaScript Files:**  \n   - Use tools like **VirusTotal** or **sandboxing** to scan the created JavaScript files for malware.  \n   - Check if they are part of a known legitimate Office add-on or if they contain obfuscated code.\n\n3. **Audit Chrome.exe Behavior:**  \n   - Correlate the `Zone.Identifier` creation with the **source of the downloaded file** (e.g., check if the file was downloaded from a suspicious domain).  \n   - Use **EDR tools** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender) to analyze the registry changes for signs of persistence.\n\n4. **Check for Privilege Escalation or Exploits:**  \n   - The combination of file creation and registry modifications could indicate **privilege escalation** or **exploitation of a vulnerability** in Chrome or Office.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile some activity (e.g., `MpClient.dll` loading) is benign, the **repetitive file creation by `SDXHelper.exe`** and **unusual Chrome behavior** raise **red flags**. These could indicate **malware activity**, **script-based attacks**, or **configuration tampering**. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this is a **false positive** or a **security incident**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events here are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or package. The paths are all under AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages, which is a known location for Office solutions. But why so many files being created? Maybe it's a normal part of installing or updating an add-in, but the repetition of the same file names might be a red flag. Wait, some of the files have the same hash or similar names, but the hashes here are different. Hmm, but maybe that's just different versions.\n\nThen there's an event where chrome.exe loads urlmon.dll, which is a normal system DLL. Not suspicious. Another event is winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file in Downloads, which could be part of configuration setup. Then Excel.exe is launched with a spreadsheet, and it loads combase.dll, another system DLL. Not suspicious either.\n\nBut wait, the main thing here is the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe. SDXHelper is part of the Office Deployment Tool, used for installing Office. So if someone is deploying Office, this could be normal. However, the fact that so many files are being created in the SolutionPackages folder might indicate that an add-in is being deployed, or maybe even a malicious one. But without more context, like the content of the files or any other suspicious activity, it's hard to tell. The logs don't show any obvious malicious activity like network connections or registry changes beyond normal process creation.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe might be part of a legitimate process, but if this is unexpected or if there are no logs of user initiating the installation, it could be worth investigating. The user might need to check if this is part of a known Office installation or if there's any unauthorized software being deployed. Since the logs don't include any obvious malware indicators, but the activity is unusual, I'd lean towards being cautious and suggesting further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs show a mix of normal system activity and potential indicators warranting further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creations:**\n   - Multiple JavaScript files (`*.js`) are created in the `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages` directory by **SDXHelper.exe** (part of Microsoft Office Deployment Tool). \n   - **Possible Legitimate Activity:** This could be part of installing\/updating an Office add-in or solution. However, the repetitive creation of files with similar names (e.g., `word_*.js`, `office_*.js`) might indicate an automated deployment process or potential tampering.\n   - **Red Flags:** \n     - No logs indicate user-initiated installation or known Office add-in activity.\n     - The files are JavaScript, which could be used for scripting in Office solutions, but their contents are not shown here.\n\n2. **Normal System Activity:**\n   - **Chrome.exe** loading `urlmon.dll` and `combase.dll` (system DLLs) is expected.\n   - **Excel.exe** launching with a spreadsheet file (`Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`) is routine.\n   - **Winlogbeat** creating a `.yml.new` file in `Downloads` is consistent with configuration setup.\n\n3. **Registry Event:**\n   - A **Registry value set** event by `chrome.exe` is logged but lacks details (no file path). This could be benign or require deeper analysis if correlated with other events.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** \n  - The bulk of the activity appears legitimate (e.g., Office deployment, Excel usage). \n  - However, the **repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe** without clear user context or known add-in activity could indicate:\n    - **Unauthorized Office add-in deployment** (e.g., malicious or unapproved software).\n    - **Potential tampering** with Office solution packages (e.g., embedded malware in `.js` files).\n\n- **No High-Risk Indicators:** \n  - No network connections, suspicious registry changes, or process injections are logged.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Correlate with User Activity:**\n   - Check if the user initiated an Office deployment or add-in installation.\n   - Verify the legitimacy of the `.js` files (e.g., hash analysis, code inspection).\n\n2. **Monitor SDXHelper.exe:**\n   - Investigate the source of the files created by SDXHelper.exe. Are they from trusted Microsoft sources?\n\n3. **Enhance Logging:**\n   - Enable more detailed logging for SDXHelper.exe and Office processes to detect anomalies.\n\n4. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Scan the created `.js` files with antivirus tools or static analysis to rule out malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **unusual volume of file creations by SDXHelper.exe** in a sensitive directory (**Office\\SolutionPackages**) warrants further investigation. This could be a **legitimate deployment** or a **potential security incident** depending on context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: SDXHelper.exe created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That path looks a bit suspicious because it's in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific files, but the name of the file is a long hash. Maybe that's normal for Office packages, but I should note it.\n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events from EXCEL.EXE loading system DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, amsi.dll, urlmon.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so loading them is normal. But there's a repetition here, like mscoree.dll being loaded multiple times. Not sure if that's a red flag yet.\n\nNext, there's a Registry value set event from svchost.exe. svchost is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes might be concerning. However, without knowing the specific registry keys, it's hard to tell. The logs don't specify which keys, so maybe not enough info here.\n\nThen, EXCEL.EXE creates a temporary file (~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx) in the Downloads folder, which is common for Excel's auto-recover feature. But then it deletes that same file. That might be normal, but if it's happening repeatedly or in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event from EXCEL.EXE. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if it's connecting to unexpected locations, that's a problem. The log doesn't mention the pipe's destination, though.\n\nAnother thing is the SDXHelper.exe creating another JavaScript file with a similar path. The repetition of file creation by SDXHelper might be normal for Office add-ins, but if there's a pattern of creating files in unexpected locations or with unusual names, that could be a concern.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, EXCEL.EXE is the main one here, which is a legitimate application. However, the combination of multiple file creations, registry changes, and image loads might be part of a larger activity. But I need to check if there's any anomaly.\n\nWait, the first event's file path is in the SolutionPackages directory under Office. That's where Office might store add-ins or packages. The JavaScript files might be part of a solution package. However, the repetition of SDXHelper.exe creating files could indicate that something is generating a lot of these files, which might be normal or not.\n\nThe temporary file creation and deletion could be part of normal Excel operations, but if it's happening in a way that's not typical, like multiple times or with different names, that might be suspicious. However, the logs only show one instance of that.\n\nThe registry events from svchost.exe are a bit concerning because svchost is a host process for system services. If it's modifying registry values, that's normal in some contexts, but without knowing the specific keys, it's hard to assess. However, multiple events might indicate some activity that's worth looking into.\n\nPutting it all together, the main points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in Office directories, repeated image loads by Excel, and registry changes by svchost. None of these individually are clearly malicious, but combined, they might indicate something unusual. However, since these could be part of normal operations (like Office add-ins or updates), it's not a clear-cut case. But the presence of multiple events that could be related to legitimate processes might not be enough to flag as interesting unless there's more context. Alternatively, if the system is under attack, these could be part of a larger pattern. But based on the given logs, I'm leaning towards not being highly suspicious, but maybe worth a closer look. However, the user might consider this as not interesting. Hmm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs exhibit a mix of normal system behavior and activities that could warrant further investigation. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation:**\n   - **Activity:** Multiple JavaScript files (e.g., `af-za-ui-strings-json_d4db2b9ad99544388b669f17a6a96d46.js`) are created in the `Office SolutionPackages` directory.\n   - **Context:** These files are likely part of Office add-ins or localized resources (e.g., UI strings). However, the repetitive creation of files with hash-like names in non-standard locations (e.g., `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`) may indicate **unusual activity** if not tied to known legitimate processes.\n\n2. **Excel.EXE Image Loads:**\n   - **Activity:** Repeated loading of system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `urlmon.dll`, `amsi.dll`) by Excel.EXE.\n   - **Context:** These are legitimate system components. However, **repetition** of the same DLLs being loaded (e.g., `mscoree.dll` appearing twice) could suggest **unusual process behavior** (e.g., tampering or injection).\n\n3. **Registry Modifications by svchost.exe:**\n   - **Activity:** Multiple `Registry value set` events from `svchost.exe`.\n   - **Context:** While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate system process, **unspecified registry changes** could hint at **configuration modifications** or **malicious activity** (e.g., persistence mechanisms). However, without details on the keys\/paths, this remains inconclusive.\n\n4. **Temporary File Creation\/Deletion:**\n   - **Activity:** Excel.EXE creates and deletes a temporary file (`~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx`).\n   - **Context:** This aligns with Excel's auto-recovery feature but could be **exploited** (e.g., for data exfiltration or malicious payload staging). The deletion may obscure evidence, warranting closer scrutiny.\n\n5. **Pipe Creation:**\n   - **Activity:** Excel.EXE creates a named pipe.\n   - **Context:** Pipes are normal for inter-process communication (IPC), but **unusual destinations** or **unauthorized connections** could indicate **malicious lateral movement** or **remote code execution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The activities observed are **not overtly malicious** but include **anomalies** (e.g., repetitive file creation, unspecified registry changes) that could indicate **benign system behavior** (e.g., Office updates) or **early-stage attacks** (e.g., reconnaissance, data exfiltration).\n- **Key Red Flags:**\n  - **Unusual file paths\/names** in `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`.\n  - **Repeated image loads** of system DLLs.\n  - **Unspecified registry modifications** by `svchost.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **Further Investigation:** Correlate these logs with:\n  - **Process tree analysis** (e.g., parent-child relationships of `SDXHelper.exe` and `Excel.EXE`).\n  - **Network traffic** (e.g., connections from the pipe or file downloads).\n  - **Registry key details** (e.g., what keys were modified by `svchost.exe`).\n- **Contextual Checks:** Confirm if these activities align with **known Office behaviors** (e.g., localized resources, auto-recovery) or if they deviate from **baseline activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the logs do not confirm malicious activity, the **combination of unusual file creation, repeated system DLL loads, and unspecified registry changes** suggests **potential for further investigation**. This batch of events is **moderately suspicious** and merits deeper analysis to rule out benign vs. malicious intent. \n\n**Final Verdict:** **Interesting for further investigation** (not definitively malicious but warrants scrutiny)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through each line.\n\nFirst, there's an entry about HxTsr.exe and a registry value being set. That might be suspicious, but maybe it's a legitimate process. Then there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and .js extensions. That seems odd because those are usually UI string files, but creating so many of them might be part of a normal Office update or installation? However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could be a red flag. \n\nThen there are entries from EXCEL.EXE creating a file stream and loading some DLLs. The Zone.Identifier stream is normal for marking files as coming from the internet, but the ImageLoad events for coml2.dll and VBEUI.DLL are standard system files. Not sure if that's suspicious yet.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe activity again, it's creating a lot of JavaScript files in specific directories. If this is part of a legitimate Office operation, maybe it's okay, but the volume and the specific naming might indicate something else. However, SDXHelper.exe is a known Microsoft process related to Office, so maybe it's normal. \n\nWait, but why are there duplicates? Like the same file being created twice. That might be a sign of something wrong. Also, HxTsr.exe isn't a common Microsoft process. Maybe it's malware. But I need to check if HxTsr.exe is legitimate. Let me think—common processes include things like svchost, explorer, but HxTsr might be part of some software. Alternatively, it could be a typo or mislogged. \n\nPutting it all together: The majority of logs are from SDXHelper.exe, which is part of Office, so creating those JS files might be normal. However, the presence of HxTsr.exe modifying the registry could be a concern. But without more context, like the registry key changed, it's hard to tell. The user might need to check if HxTsr.exe is a legitimate process on their system. \n\nBut the main point is that the logs don't show clear signs of malicious activity. The SDXHelper activity seems related to Office, and the EXCEL.EXE entries are normal. The only possible red flag is HxTsr.exe, but without more info, it's unclear. So maybe this isn't interesting for investigation, unless the user has reason to suspect HxTsr.exe. But the answer might be that it's not suspicious, or maybe the repetition of files is a clue. Hmm.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries do not indicate clear signs of malicious activity, but there are a few points worth noting:\n\n1. **SDXHelper.exe File Creation**:  \n   - Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (e.g., `*.js`) in the `Microsoft Office\\SolutionPackages` directory. These files appear to be localized UI strings (e.g., `az-latn-az-ui-strings-json_...`). While this could be part of a legitimate Office update or installation, the **repetition of identical files** being created (e.g., `bg-bg-ui-strings-json_...` appearing twice) raises a minor red flag. This might indicate a benign process, but further investigation into the context of these files (e.g., timestamps, file hashes) could be warranted.\n\n2. **HxTsr.exe and Registry Modification**:  \n   - A single entry involving `HxTsr.exe` modifying a registry value is noted. However, **`HxTsr.exe` is not a well-known Microsoft process**, and its presence could be suspicious. If this process is not recognized on the system (e.g., via `tasklist` or file analysis), it may warrant closer scrutiny. However, without additional context (e.g., the specific registry key modified), it is unclear whether this is malicious or a false positive.\n\n3. **Excel.EXE Activity**:  \n   - The logs include normal activities from `EXCEL.EXE`, such as creating a `Zone.Identifier` stream (common for downloaded files) and loading standard DLLs (e.g., `coml2.dll`, `VBEUI.DLL`). These are typical and not indicative of malware.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe logs do not present strong evidence of malicious activity. The **repetition of `SDXHelper.exe` file creation** and the **unusual `HxTsr.exe` process** are the most notable points. If `HxTsr.exe` is not a legitimate process on the system, further investigation is recommended. Otherwise, the activity appears to align with normal Office operations.  \n\n**Verdict**: **Low risk**, but the presence of `HxTsr.exe` and repeated file creation by `SDXHelper.exe` should be monitored."}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I'll scan through each event to see what's going on.\n\nThe first event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That seems normal because winlogbeat is a log shipper, so it might be setting up configuration files. The path is in a typical location for downloads, and the file is .yml.new, which could be a temporary configuration file. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about SDXHelper.exe creating JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The filenames are things like fabric_...js and bn-in-ui-strings-json...js. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, I think, related to add-ins or solutions. Creating these files in the SolutionPackages folder might be part of normal Office operations, especially if they're part of a package's resources. However, the repetition of the same files being created twice each might be a red flag. Why are they created multiple times? Maybe a loop or an error?\n\nThen there's Explorer.EXE and EXCEL.EXE modifying registry values. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're frequent or in suspicious keys, that's a concern. However, the logs don't specify which registry keys are being modified. EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder is normal; that's just a shortcut to a recent file. But there are multiple entries for EXCEL.EXE modifying registry values. If it's a lot, that could indicate something, but with the information given, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, the majority of events are from legitimate processes (winlogbeat, SDXHelper, Explorer, Excel) performing normal operations. The SDXHelper creating multiple JavaScript files might be part of a package installation or update. However, the repetition of the same files could indicate an issue. But without more context, like unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to say this is malicious.\n\nThe key here is that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the actions taken are typical for their roles. The repetition of file creation might be a minor anomaly, but not enough to flag as suspicious without further investigation. So, the conclusion is that this batch of logs doesn't show anything that requires immediate investigation. It's probably just normal system and application activity.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries reflect normal system and application activity without clear indicators of malicious behavior. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes:**\n   - **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` configuration file in the Downloads directory is consistent with its role as a log shipper.\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** generating JavaScript files (e.g., `fabric_...js`, `bundle_...js`) in the Office `SolutionPackages` directory aligns with Microsoft Office's handling of add-ins or solution resources. Repeated entries for the same files may reflect redundant operations (e.g., package caching) but are not inherently suspicious.\n   - **`Explorer.EXE`** and **`EXCEL.EXE`** modifying registry values and creating `.LNK` shortcuts in the `Recent` folder are typical for user interactions and application state management.\n\n2. **No Anomalies Detected:**\n   - No unusual processes, unexpected network activity, or suspicious file paths (e.g., temp folders, system directories) are present.\n   - Registry modifications are not detailed enough to infer malicious intent (e.g., no indication of key tampering or persistence mechanisms).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs represent routine operations by legitimate system and application components. While the repetition of `SDXHelper.exe` file creation might warrant further scrutiny in isolation, it is not sufficient to flag the batch as requiring immediate investigation. No clear security threats or abnormal behavior are evident. \n\n**Final Verdict:** ❌ **Not Interesting for Investigation** (normal activity)."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events. The first thing I notice is that there are a lot of entries where the process is EXCEL.EXE and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". There are 27 of those. Then there are a few entries where the process is null and the task is \"None\". Finally, there are two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\" with a specific file path.\n\nHmm, so the majority of the logs are about Excel setting registry values. Now, Excel is a common application, but changing registry values can be a red flag. However, just having multiple registry changes from Excel might not be necessarily malicious. Maybe it's part of normal operations. But then, why so many? Maybe it's a script or macro that's running multiple times, which could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's the SDXHelper.exe creating a JavaScript file in a specific directory. The path includes \"Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\SolutionPackages\", which seems legitimate. But the filename is a long hash-like string. That might be a sign of something generated by the system, but the fact that it's being created by SDXHelper.exe could be part of a package installation or update. However, if this is unexpected, it might be worth looking into.\n\nWait, but the user is asking whether the batch is relevant for investigation. So, are these events indicative of a security incident? The repeated registry changes by Excel might be normal, but if it's happening in a short time frame, that's unusual. However, the logs don't include timestamps, so I can't tell if they're spread out or clustered. The file creation by SDXHelper.exe might be part of a legitimate Office update or deployment. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nBut considering the combination of multiple registry changes by Excel and the creation of a file in a Microsoft Office directory, maybe there's a connection. However, the presence of SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office setup, so that's probably legitimate. The repeated registry changes might be benign, like Excel updating settings during normal use. However, if there's a pattern or if it's part of a larger attack, it could be malicious.\n\nBut since all the events are from a single process (Excel) and a legitimate helper tool, maybe it's not a security issue. However, the sheer number of registry changes could be a sign of something. Alternatively, maybe it's just a user interacting with Excel a lot. Without more info, it's tricky. But given the information, I think the justification would be that the events are not suspicious because they involve legitimate processes and files. However, the high number of registry changes might be a red flag, but without more context, it's hard to classify as definitely interesting. Maybe the confidence is moderate. Wait, but the user wants a classification of either interesting or not. If the majority are normal processes and the others are part of legitimate activities, maybe it's not interesting. But I need to check if there's any suspicious pattern. The file created by SDXHelper.exe is in a known directory, and the name is a hash, which is common for generated files. So maybe that's okay. The repeated registry changes by Excel could be part of a macro or script, but again, without more context, it's hard. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve legitimate processes (EXCEL.EXE, SDXHelper.exe) and file creation in standard Office directories.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the events, there are multiple entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is creating files in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The file names are JavaScript files with hashes in them. Then there are also DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. \n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process related to Office add-ins, but creating a lot of files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal for updates or installations. However, the repetition of file creation events with different hashes could indicate something. Are these files part of a normal update, or could they be malicious?\n\nWait, the file names have parts like \"transcription-strings.min\" which might be related to some add-on or feature. But the hashes are unique, which is typical for legitimate files. However, the fact that there are so many different files being created might be a red flag. Also, the DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE – are they normal? If the DNS queries are going to suspicious domains, that would be a problem. But the logs don't show the domains, just that EXCEL.EXE is making queries.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the user might be using a version of Office that's being updated, and these files are part of that process. But if this is happening frequently or in an unusual context, it could be a sign of something else. However, without more information on the domains involved or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say. \n\nBut considering that all the events are related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe and DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE, and no other anomalies are present, maybe this is just part of normal Office operations. However, the high number of file creations might be worth investigating further. Maybe the system is being used for something unexpected, like hosting files or being part of a botnet. But without more data, it's tricky. \n\nI think the key points here are the repetition of file creation by a legitimate process and the DNS activity. Since the logs don't show any obvious malicious indicators like unknown domains or unexpected process behavior, but the volume of file creations is high, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in the absence of other suspicious signs, it might not be a critical threat. But it's still worth flagging for further investigation to be safe.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of Log Entries:**\n\n1. **Process Activity:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** (a legitimate Microsoft Office process) is repeatedly creating JavaScript files (`.js`) in the `SolutionPackages` directory under `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office`. \n   - File names include hashes (e.g., `41d770caa4405d96cfefae03e2c3685f.js`) and language-specific strings (e.g., `cy-gb-ui-strings-json_9726f0fb2d25823eec75c2d28f5e4d55.js`), suggesting localization or add-on-related content.\n\n2. **DNS Queries:**\n   - **EXCEL.EXE** is making DNS queries. While this is normal for legitimate activity (e.g., connecting to Office 365 or updates), the logs do not specify the domains involved, so further investigation would be required to assess risk.\n\n3. **Potential Indicators of Concern:**\n   - **High Volume of File Creations:** The repeated creation of files by **SDXHelper.exe** could indicate normal Office operations (e.g., updates, add-ins), but the sheer number of unique files might suggest unexpected behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, malicious payload storage).\n   - **Absence of Malicious Signatures:** No obvious malicious indicators (e.g., suspicious domains, process anomalies) are present in the logs.\n\n4. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a legitimate process, but its activity should be validated against known good behavior (e.g., checking for updates to Office add-ins or language packs).\n   - The JavaScript files may be part of legitimate Office features (e.g., transcription tools, localization), but their hashes and naming conventions could also be used by malware to evade detection.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe log entries **do not definitively indicate a threat**, but they **warrant further investigation** due to the unusual volume of file creations by a legitimate process. Key steps for validation include:\n\n- **Correlating File Hashes:** Check if the hashes match known legitimate Office files or are flagged as malicious in threat intelligence databases.\n- **Analyzing DNS Queries:** Investigate the domains contacted by **EXCEL.EXE** to rule out C2 communication or phishing.\n- **Monitoring System Behavior:** Ensure **SDXHelper.exe** is not being exploited (e.g., via process injection, unexpected network activity).\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \n**Interesting for Further Investigation** – The logs are not overtly malicious but exhibit patterns that could indicate either normal Office activity or a potential security incident requiring deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a JavaScript file in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the events are the same process creating files, and the files are all .js files with names that look like they're language-specific UI strings, like en-us-ui-strings-json... That makes me think these are part of a legitimate Office add-in or localization files.\n\nBut wait, why are there so many of them? Let me check the paths again. They're all in the User's AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages folder. That's a known location for Office add-ins, so maybe this is just a normal installation or update process. However, the filenames have hashes in them, like _328d1c4fc74218eea9d206b5ac9fbc10.js. That's a bit unusual for standard localization files, which might use more straightforward naming. Hashes are often used in software updates to ensure files are unique and not tampered with, but that's more common in system updates or package management.\n\nAnother thing to consider: SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, particularly with the installation of add-ins or updates. So if this process is creating these files as part of an Office update, it might be normal. However, if the user hasn't initiated any Office updates or installations, this could be suspicious.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't mentioned any specific context about their system. So I need to be cautious. The repetition of the same process creating multiple files in a short time could be indicative of a legitimate process, but it could also be a sign of malware trying to inject files. However, the fact that all the files are in the expected Office directory and have names that resemble legitimate localization files makes me lean towards it being a normal activity.\n\nStill, the presence of multiple files with unique hashes might be part of a larger package. Maybe the user is installing a new add-in or a language pack. Without more context, it's hard to say. But given the information, the most plausible explanation is that this is part of a legitimate Office update or add-in installation. Therefore, the logs might not be malicious. However, if the user is unsure or if this is happening without their knowledge, further investigation would be needed, like checking the digital signatures of the files or using antivirus tools.\n<\/think>\n\n**Analysis of the Log Entries:**\n\nThe provided logs show repeated activity where the `SDXHelper.exe` process creates JavaScript files (`.js`) in the `Microsoft Office` SolutionPackages directory. Here's a structured breakdown of the observations and implications:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process and File Location:**\n   - **Process:** `SDXHelper.exe` is associated with **Microsoft Office** and is typically involved in **add-in installations** or **update operations**.\n   - **File Path:** All files are created in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`, a directory commonly used by Office for managing add-ins and updates.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern:**\n   - Filenames follow a structure like `en-us-ui-strings-json_<hash>.js`, suggesting they might be **localization files** or **UI string resources** for different languages (e.g., `en-us`, `es-es`, `en-gb`).\n   - The use of **hashes** in filenames is common in **software updates** to ensure uniqueness and integrity, but it is less typical for standard localization files.\n\n3. **Repetition and Volume:**\n   - Multiple entries for the same process creating files in the same directory suggest a **batch operation** (e.g., installing an add-in, updating Office, or deploying language packs).\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Explanations:**\n1. **Legitimate Office Activity:**\n   - **Office Add-in Installation\/Update:** `SDXHelper.exe` is known to manage Office add-ins. The files could be part of a **new add-in deployment** or **language pack update**.\n   - **Localization Files:** The filenames hint at language-specific UI strings, which might be part of an **Office localization update**.\n\n2. **Malicious Activity (Less Likely but Possible):**\n   - If the user has **not initiated an Office update** or **add-in installation**, the activity could be **suspicious**.\n   - The use of hashes in filenames might be a **tactic to obfuscate malicious payloads**, though this is less common than in malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Verify Legitimacy:**\n  - Check if the user recently installed an Office add-in, updated Office, or deployed language packs.\n  - Confirm the **digital signature** of `SDXHelper.exe` (should be signed by Microsoft).\n- **Monitor for Anomalies:**\n  - If this activity occurs **without user initiation**, investigate further using tools like **Windows Defender** or **endpoint detection systems**.\n  - Check for **unusual network activity** or **unrecognized processes** alongside this behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **most likely legitimate**, reflecting an **Office update or add-in deployment**. However, without additional context (e.g., user-initiated actions, system behavior), further investigation is advised to rule out anomalies."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All the entries are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are named with language codes and some random strings, like es-mx-ui-strings-json_5cb7022dca779ce9527f3635afb9d81e.js. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It might be involved in handling add-ins or language packs. The files are in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which could be related to caching or temporary storage. However, the filenames include language codes, which might indicate they're part of localization resources.\n\nBut wait, the same file names are repeated multiple times. For example, the es-mx one appears twice, and others like fi-fi and fr-ca also have duplicates. That's a bit odd. Also, there are two different SolutionPackages folders: one with ID 36f79ca6... and another with f9836956... Maybe that's normal, but the repetition of the same files in different packages could be a red flag.\n\nI should check if creating multiple instances of the same file in different packages is typical. If these are temporary files, maybe they're being generated as part of a process, but the repetition might indicate something's wrong. Alternatively, it could be part of a legitimate update or installation process.\n\nAnother point is the use of SDXHelper.exe. If this process is known to create such files, then it's probably benign. However, if there's no prior knowledge of this behavior, it might be worth investigating further. The presence of multiple files with similar names in different directories could be a sign of malware trying to drop files, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that these are just log entries from a legitimate process. The fact that all events are from the same process and the same directory structure might indicate that it's part of a normal operation, like installing language packs or updating Office components. However, the repeated creation of the same files might be an error or a loop.\n\nIn conclusion, while the activity could be normal, the repetition and the specific naming pattern might warrant further investigation to ensure there's no malicious activity. But without additional information, it's a bit hard to determine definitively. The key points are the process involved, the location of the files, and the repetition of the same filenames.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the creation of multiple `.js` files by **SDXHelper.exe** (a component of Microsoft Office) in the `OfflineFiles` subdirectory of Office's `SolutionPackages`. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process and Location**:\n   - All files are created by **SDXHelper.exe**, which is a legitimate Microsoft Office process involved in managing add-ins, language packs, or other Office-related resources.\n   - The files are stored in `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`, a known directory for Office temporary or cached files.\n\n2. **File Naming Pattern**:\n   - Filenames include **language codes** (e.g., `es-mx`, `fi-fi`, `fr-ca`) and a **random hash** (e.g., `_5cb7022dca779ce9527f3635afb9d81e.js`).\n   - This suggests the files may be **language-specific resources** (e.g., UI strings) or **temporary files** generated during Office operations.\n\n3. **Repetition of Files**:\n   - Some files (e.g., `es-mx-ui-strings-json_...`, `fi-fi-ui-strings-json_...`) are created **multiple times** in different `SolutionPackages` folders. This could indicate:\n     - **Legitimate caching** during Office updates or installations.\n     - **Redundant operations** (e.g., a process error causing repeated file creation).\n\n---\n\n### **Is This Behavior Normal?**\n- **Likely legitimate** if:\n  - The files are part of a **language pack installation** or **Office update**.\n  - The repetition is due to temporary file generation during a process (e.g., unpacking resources).\n- **Suspicious** if:\n  - The files are **identical** and created in **unusual contexts** (e.g., without user-initiated Office activity).\n  - The process **SDXHelper.exe** is **not associated with Office** (e.g., if it's a malicious imposter).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Verify SDXHelper.exe Authenticity**:\n   - Check the file path: `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\v16.0\\Office16\\SDXHelper.exe` (or similar).\n   - Use tools like **Microsoft Defender** or **Malwarebytes** to scan for anomalies.\n\n2. **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**:\n   - Look for **high CPU\/disk usage** by SDXHelper.exe.\n   - Check if the files are **deleted** after creation (normal for temporary files) or **persistently stored** (unusual).\n\n3. **Check Office Logs**:\n   - Review Office installation\/update logs (e.g., `%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\Logs`) for references to the files.\n\n4. **Consider Malware Possibility**:\n   - If the files are **not related to Office** (e.g., contain malicious code or connect to unknown domains), further investigation is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe behavior is **likely legitimate** if tied to Office operations, but the **repetition of identical files** warrants closer monitoring. If no user-initiated Office activity is occurring, or if the files are suspicious, further analysis (e.g., file inspection, process isolation) is advisable."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event. The process involved is mostly SDXHelper.exe, which is part of Microsoft Office, creating various UI string files in different languages. The paths are all under the Office SolutionPackages directory. Then there's one event from winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Office, so creating UI string files for different languages might be normal, especially if the user is installing or updating Office. The repetition of the same process and similar file paths could be part of a normal installation or update process.\n\nHowever, the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file is a bit different. Winlogbeat is a Beats agent used for collecting logs and metrics. The .yml.new file might be a temporary file during configuration. But why is this event in the list? If the user is running Winlogbeat for monitoring, this could be normal. However, if there's no prior context of Winlogbeat being used, this might be unusual.\n\nBut looking at the rest of the events, they are all from SDXHelper.exe, which is part of Office. The fact that there's only one event from winlogbeat.exe might not be enough to flag it as malicious. However, the .yml.new file could be a sign of configuration changes. But without more context, like other suspicious activities or known malicious behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the user might be installing Office, leading to multiple file creations. The repetition of the same process and similar file names (different languages) could be part of that. The winlogbeat event might be unrelated, perhaps the user is setting up monitoring tools. But if the user didn't expect that, it could be a red flag.\n\nHowever, the key here is that the majority of events are from a legitimate process. The single winlogbeat event might not be enough to consider this a security threat. Unless there are other indicators, like unexpected network activity or other processes, this might be a false positive. But as per the given data, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. So, maybe the answer is that it's not suspicious, but the winlogbeat event is worth noting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs consist of multiple file creation events, primarily from the legitimate Microsoft Office process **SDXHelper.exe**, which is responsible for managing language-specific UI strings during Office installations or updates. The repetition of similar file paths (e.g., `*.ui-strings-json_*.js`) under the `SolutionPackages` directory is consistent with normal Office behavior, especially when handling multilingual resources.\n\nHowever, **one event** stands out:  \n- **`winlogbeat.exe`** creating a `.yml.new` file in the `Downloads` directory.  \n  - **Winlogbeat** is a legitimate tool for log collection, but the `.yml.new` file suggests a temporary configuration file being written. While this could be part of a user-initiated setup (e.g., configuring Winlogbeat for monitoring), it is **unusual to see this process in the context of the other Office-related events** unless explicitly expected.  \n\n### Risk Assessment:  \n- **Low to Moderate Risk**: The majority of events are benign (SDXHelper.exe). The Winlogbeat event alone is not inherently malicious but could indicate an unrelated activity (e.g., a user installing\/configuring a log agent).  \n- **No direct evidence of compromise** (e.g., no suspicious file paths, unexpected network activity, or anomalies in process behavior).  \n\n### Recommendation:  \n- If **Winlogbeat** was not intentionally installed or configured by the user, further investigation is warranted (e.g., check for unexpected configuration files or network traffic).  \n- Otherwise, the events appear to be part of normal Office operations and Winlogbeat setup.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The logs are likely **benign**, but the Winlogbeat event merits contextual verification."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating various JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the events are about file creation, and the process is the same each time. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not entirely sure what that is, but maybe it's part of some software development kit or a tool related to Microsoft Office? The files being created have names like \"icon_fluent_icon...\" and \"ui-strings-json\", which might be part of a UI resource or localization files. The directories mentioned are under \"PackageResources\" and \"OfflineFiles\", which sounds like they're part of a package or deployment process.\n\nBut wait, why so many repeated entries? Each file is being created twice, except for the \"fabric.js\" which is also duplicated. That might be a normal part of the process, like a build or deployment step where files are being copied or generated. However, if this is happening frequently or in a short time frame, it could indicate something else, like a loop or a malicious activity. But looking at the file names, they seem legitimate, not like typical malware files.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the user's environment. If this is on a system where Office is being developed or customized, this could be normal. But if the user isn't expecting this activity, it might be worth checking. However, the logs don't show any errors or unusual processes. The process is legitimate, and the files are being created in expected directories. \n\nI don't see any signs of malicious activity here. The process is creating files that seem related to Office resources. Unless there's a known issue with SDXHelper.exe, but I don't recall any. So, maybe this is just a normal part of the software's operation. The user might not need to worry unless they're seeing unexpected behavior or performance issues.

The files appear to be legitimate resources (e.g., icons, localization files) used by Office applications or add-ins.\n- **No obvious signs of malicious activity** (e.g., unusual file types, unexpected directories, or high-frequency events).\n\n### **When to Investigate Further:**\n- If the user **did not initiate this activity** (e.g., unexpected file creation on a non-development machine).\n- If **performance issues** (e.g., high CPU\/disk usage by `SDXHelper.exe`) or **unusual network activity** are observed.\n- If the files contain **non-standard content** (e.g., obfuscated code, unexpected binaries).\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n- **No immediate action required** if this is on a development or Office customization environment.\n- **Monitor** for unexpected behavior or confirm the legitimacy of `SDXHelper.exe` via process analysis tools (e.g., Task Manager, antivirus scans).\n\n**Conclusion:** The activity appears to be **legitimate and part of a normal Office resource-building process**."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The logs are in JSONL format, each line is a separate event. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The filenames have language codes and some hash-like strings. There are multiple entries for the same files, which might be duplicates or just multiple creations. Then there are some events related to EXCEL.EXE doing DNS queries and registry changes, and svchost.exe also doing registry events. The last entry is a process with null values, which might be an error or incomplete log.\n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a common Windows process. I know that some legitimate software might use it, but if it's creating a lot of files in the Office directory, that could be suspicious. The filenames look like they might be part of a package or update, but the repetition and the specific structure might indicate something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious.\n\nThe registry events from svchost.exe and EXCEL.EXE could be normal, but they might also be signs of tampering. However, svchost.exe is a standard process for hosting services, so those events might be legitimate. The DNS query from EXCEL.EXE could be part of normal operations, like looking up a domain, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple file creation events for the same files might not be a big red flag if they're part of an installation or update. But the presence of SDXHelper.exe doing this in the Office directory is a bit unusual. Also, the last event with process null might be an error, but it's just one entry.\n\nI should consider if there are any known threats related to SDXHelper.exe. Maybe checking some databases or threat intelligence. However, in the absence of that, I have to rely on patterns. The repetitive file creation in a specific directory by a non-standard process could be a sign of something malicious, like a dropper or part of a larger attack. But it could also be a legitimate software component that's not well-known.\n\nThe registry changes might be part of the software's installation, but again, they could be signs of persistence mechanisms. The combination of file creation and registry changes might be more suspicious. However, without seeing the actual content of the files or the registry changes, it's hard to be certain.\n\nIn summary, the logs show activity that's not typical for standard processes, especially SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in Office's directories. The presence of registry events and the repetition of file creation might indicate potential malicious activity. However, more context would be needed to confirm. Since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, I think it's worth looking into further, hence the classification as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries exhibit a mix of activities that warrant further investigation due to potential anomalies and suspicious patterns. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repetitive File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`:**\n   - **Pattern:** Multiple entries show `SDXHelper.exe` creating JavaScript files (`.js`) in the directory `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages\\...`, with filenames containing language codes (e.g., `it-ch`, `km-kh`) and hash-like suffixes (e.g., `581996aec636d21d7395a07b3de700ad.js`).\n   - **Suspiciousness:** \n     - `SDXHelper.exe` is not a standard Windows process. While it may be associated with legitimate software (e.g., some Office add-ins or third-party tools), the repetitive creation of files in the Office directory raises concerns.\n     - The filenames suggest localized resources, but the use of hash-like strings might indicate obfuscation or tampering.\n\n2. **Registry and DNS Activity:**\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe`:** These processes show registry modifications (e.g., \"Registry value set\" or \"Registry object added\/deleted\") and a DNS query. While registry changes are common during software installation or updates, the lack of context (e.g., specific keys\/objects modified) makes it hard to assess legitimacy.\n   - **DNS Query by `EXCEL.EXE`:** Unusual for Excel, which typically does not perform DNS queries. Could indicate network-based malicious behavior (e.g., exfiltration or C2 communication).\n\n3. **Inconsistent Logging:**\n   - The last entry has `process: null` and `winlog: {\"task\": \"None\"}`, which may indicate a logging error or incomplete data. This could obscure critical details.\n\n### **Potential Threat Indicators:**\n- **Unusual Process Behavior:** `SDXHelper.exe` creating files in a trusted directory (Microsoft Office) may be part of a dropper or payload delivery mechanism.\n- **Lateral Movement:** The combination of file creation and registry modifications could hint at persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within the network.\n- **Obfuscation:** Hash-like filenames and repetitive events may suggest evasion techniques to avoid detection.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`:** Check its digital signature, parent process, and network behavior. Use tools like Process Explorer or Procmon to monitor its activity.\n- **Analyze Registry Changes:** Identify the specific registry keys\/objects modified by `EXCEL.EXE` and `svchost.exe` to determine legitimacy.\n- **Check for Malware Signatures:** Scan the created `.js` files with antivirus tools or YARA rules targeting known malicious payloads.\n- **Correlate with Network Logs:** Examine the DNS query from `EXCEL.EXE` for suspicious domains or IP addresses.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **potential indicators of compromise** (e.g., unusual process behavior, repetitive file creation, and registry modifications). While not definitively malicious, these activities merit further investigation to rule out adversarial activity. **This is classified as \"Interesting\" for investigation** due to the combination of non-standard process behavior and lack of clear benign context."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first entry is a bit odd because the process and file fields are null, and the winlog task is \"None.\" That might just be a placeholder or an error, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there are two entries where the process is SDXHelper.exe creating a file in the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The file path seems a bit long and has a random-looking name with a hash in it. That might be suspicious because legitimate files usually don't have such names. But maybe it's part of a normal Office installation? Not sure yet.\n\nAfter that, there are 23 entries all from EXCEL.EXE with the task \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent).\" That's a lot of registry changes. Excel normally doesn't modify the registry that much, especially if it's just opening a file. But if someone is using Excel to execute malicious code, they might modify the registry to persist or change settings. However, 23 events in a row from Excel seems excessive. Could be a false positive if the rule is too broad, but it's still worth checking.\n\nThe combination of a suspicious file being created by SDXHelper.exe and multiple registry changes by Excel might indicate something malicious. But I need to consider if these are normal activities. SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, so creating files in the SolutionPackages folder might be normal during updates or installations. However, the file name with a hash could be a red flag. The repeated registry events from Excel could be a sign of tampering or an attack vector.\n\nBut without more context, like the user's environment or other logs, it's hard to be certain. The presence of both unusual file creation and excessive registry changes might be enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.

So, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the first seven entries, they all have the process name EXCEL.EXE and the winlog task is \"Registry value set (rule: RegistryEvent)\". The file field is null here. Now, Excel normally doesn't modify the registry much, but maybe that's part of its normal operations? However, multiple registry changes from Excel could be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern. But since all these events are the same, maybe they're just routine. But I should note that.\n\nThen, starting from the eighth entry, there's a shift. The process name changes to SDXHelper.exe, and the task is \"File created (rule: FileCreate)\". The files being created are in paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory. The filenames look like they're related to language-specific UI strings, like kok-in-ui-strings-json, lb-lu-ui-strings-json, etc. These seem to be localization files. But why are they being created in the Office directory?\n\nSDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. I know that some malicious software uses helper executables with names that sound legitimate. The fact that multiple files are being created in a specific directory might indicate some kind of deployment or installation. However, if this is part of a legitimate Office update or language pack installation, it might be normal. But the presence of multiple files with similar naming patterns could also be a sign of something like a malicious payload being dropped.\n\nWait, the filenames include things like \"transcription-strings.min.js\" which might be related to transcription features. But why would SDXHelper.exe be creating these files? Also, the directory structure seems to be under SolutionPackages, which might be related to Office add-ins or solutions. However, if this is part of a legitimate process, there might be more context, like a user initiating an installation or update. But since the logs don't mention user interaction, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe combination of Excel modifying the registry and SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in Office directories might be a red flag. It could be that the registry changes are part of configuring the environment for the SDXHelper process, which is then deploying these files. But without more context, like timestamps or user actions, it's tricky.\n\nAnother point is that the same file is being created multiple times. For example, the kok-in-ui-strings-json file is logged twice. Maybe that's just a log duplication, but it could also indicate that the process is retrying or that there's some error.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. Maybe it's part of a third-party application that integrates with Office. However, without knowing the specific context of the environment where these logs are coming from, it's hard to confirm.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of multiple registry changes from Excel and the creation of several files by an uncommon process (SDXHelper.exe) in a sensitive directory might indicate a potential security threat. However, it's also possible that these events are part of a legitimate software deployment. The key factors here are the unusual process name, the repetitive nature of the file creations, and the lack of obvious user-initiated actions. These could be signs of a malicious activity, such as a dropper or a part of a larger attack chain.\n\nTherefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation. The combination of unusual process activities and repetitive file creation in critical directories warrants further analysis to determine if they're part of a legitimate process or a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events presents **suspicious activity** that warrants investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Unusual Process Activity**:\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** performing multiple **registry modifications** (e.g., \"Registry value set\") is atypical. While Excel may interact with the registry during updates, repeated modifications without clear context could indicate tampering or malicious configuration.\n\n2. **Suspicious File Creation by `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Microsoft process. Its repeated creation of files in **`Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages`** (e.g., `kok-in-ui-strings-json`, `transcription-strings.min.js`) raises concerns. \n   - The filenames suggest **localization or UI string resources**, but their placement in a directory typically associated with **Office add-ins or solutions** is inconsistent with standard behavior. This could indicate:\n     - **Malicious payload deployment** (e.g., dropper or staged attack).\n     - **Unsanctioned software installation** (e.g., third-party tools or malware).\n\n3. **Redundant File Creation**:\n   - Multiple identical file creation events (e.g., `lv-lv-ui-strings-json` logged twice) may indicate **retry logic, errors, or automated processes**—a potential red flag if unrelated to legitimate operations.\n\n4. **Lack of Context**:\n   - No user interaction or application-specific events (e.g., Office updates, add-in installations) are mentioned, making it harder to distinguish between benign and malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Likely Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n  - Unusual process (`SDXHelper.exe`) performing file operations in sensitive directories.\n  - Repetitive, potentially redundant file creation.\n- **Potential Threats**:\n  - **Malware deployment** (e.g., staged payloads, language-specific obfuscation).\n  - **Persistence mechanisms** (e.g., registry modifications to maintain access).\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Investigate `SDXHelper.exe`**:\n   - Check its **digital signature**, **file hash**, and **parent process** to confirm legitimacy.\n   - Monitor for network activity or further file modifications.\n\n2. **Analyze Registry Changes**:\n   - Review the **registry keys modified** by `EXCEL.EXE` to determine if they relate to legitimate Office operations or unauthorized configuration.\n\n3. **Check for User Context**:\n   - Determine if the user initiated any software installations or updates around the time of these events.\n\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs**:\n   - Look for **network traffic**, **process spawning**, or **file execution** tied to `SDXHelper.exe` or the created files.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis activity is **highly suspicious** and likely requires further investigation to rule out **malware deployment** or **unauthorized software activity**. The combination of unusual processes, file creation in sensitive directories, and lack of clear user context strongly suggests a need for deeper analysis."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to check for any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The file paths are all under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, specifically in the OfflineFiles directory. The filenames look like they're language-specific UI strings, like \"mi-mi-ui-strings-json...\" and so on. That seems normal for localization files, maybe part of an Office add-in or something similar.\n\nBut wait, there's one event where the process is EXCEL.EXE creating a file. However, looking at the details, it's actually SDXHelper.exe that's doing the creating. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh, no, in the logs, the process name is SDXHelper.exe in all cases. The user might have thought there's an EXCEL.EXE, but no, looking back, all entries have \"process\": \"SDXHelper.exe\". \n\nSo, SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, part of Microsoft's software, used for managing add-ins and solutions in Office. Creating these UI string files could be part of normal operations, especially if they're related to different locales. However, the repetition of the same process creating multiple files with similar names might be a red flag. But considering the filenames are different for each locale, it's possible they're just adding support for multiple languages.\n\nAnother thing to check is if there are any unusual patterns. All the files are JSON files, which makes sense for UI strings. The paths are all within the expected directory structure for Office solutions. There's no mention of any malicious activity, like downloading files from the internet or executing scripts. \n\nHowever, the sheer number of files being created might be worth investigating. If this is part of a normal update or installation, it's okay. But if this is happening frequently or without user interaction, it could indicate something wrong. But based on the provided data, there's no evidence of that. \n\nI should also consider if SDXHelper.exe is being used in a way it's not supposed to. But given that it's a known Microsoft process, and the files are in the correct location, it's more likely legitimate. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that these events are probably normal operations related to Office add-ins or localization files. Unless there's more context indicating otherwise, like other suspicious activities not shown here, they might not be a security threat. But maybe the user should monitor for any unexpected behavior from SDXHelper.exe, just to be safe.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided logs indicate a series of file creation events by **SDXHelper.exe**, a legitimate Microsoft process associated with managing Office add-ins and solutions. Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Process Legitimacy**:\n   - **SDXHelper.exe** is a known, benign process used by Microsoft Office for handling add-ins and localized resources. Its involvement here aligns with typical operations.\n\n2. **File Patterns**:\n   - All files are JSON-formatted and named with locale-specific codes (e.g., `mi-mi-ui-strings-json...`, `nb-no-ui-strings-json...`), suggesting they are **language-specific UI strings** for localization purposes. This is consistent with normal Office add-in behavior.\n\n3. **Directory Structure**:\n   - Files are created under `C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Wef\\OfflineFiles`, a standard path for Office-related temporary or localized resources.\n\n4. **No Suspicious Activity**:\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior (e.g., unexpected network activity, unusual process interactions, or file types).\n   - All events are confined to file creation, which is expected during add-in installation or localization updates.\n\n### **Potential Concerns**:\n- **High Volume of Files**: While the files are localized resources, the sheer number of entries (multiple locale-specific files) could indicate an **unusual or forced update**. However, this alone is not conclusive without additional context (e.g., user-initiated actions, timestamps, or correlation with other logs).\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe events are **likely legitimate** and part of normal Office operations, such as updating or installing add-ins with multilingual support. **No immediate security threat** is evident. However, if this activity occurs **unexpectedly** (e.g., without user interaction or during unusual times), further investigation into the source of the add-in or localization package is warranted.\n\n**Recommendation**: Monitor for unusual behavior from **SDXHelper.exe** (e.g., high resource usage, network connections to unknown domains) and ensure all Office updates are applied through official channels."}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are three entries here, all from the same process, SDXHelper.exe. Each one is a file creation event under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files being created are all JavaScript files related to UI strings in different languages, like nb-no and ne-np.\n\nHmm, first thought: SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Maybe it's part of some software, but I should check if it's legitimate. However, the user hasn't provided any context on whether this process is known good or bad. But the fact that it's creating files in the Office SolutionPackages folder might be suspicious. That directory is typically used by Microsoft Office for storing solution packages, but is it common for SDXHelper.exe to be writing there?\n\nWait, the filenames are ui-strings-json with specific hashes. The paths are under AppData, which is a common place for user-specific data. But creating multiple files with similar names might indicate some kind of deployment or update. However, the same file is mentioned twice in the third event. Maybe that's a duplicate entry? Or perhaps a mistake in the log? But the user says the batch is to be considered as a whole.\n\nNow, considering the classification. Are these events suspicious? Well, the process name isn't a standard one. If SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, this could be a red flag. However, without more context, like other events related to this process, or if it's part of a known malicious activity, it's hard to say. But the fact that it's creating multiple files in a specific directory might be part of a larger attack, like deploying malicious payloads. But the files here are just JavaScript files for UI strings, which could be legitimate if part of an Office add-in or something similar.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is that all three events are from the same process and same directory. The repetition of the same file in the third event might be a mistake, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the process is generating multiple files as part of a legitimate operation. However, the lack of other context makes it hard to determine. \n\nGiven that, the justification would be that the same process is creating multiple files in a non-standard location, which could be part of a malicious activity. However, since the files are related to UI strings and the path is under Microsoft Office's directory, it's possible they're legitimate. But without more information, the presence of the same process creating multiple files in a specific location raises some suspicion. Therefore, the classification might be INTERESTING with moderate confidence, as there's enough to warrant further investigation but not enough to confirm malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Same process (SDXHelper.exe) repeatedly creates multiple files in a non-standard Microsoft Office directory, which may indicate suspicious activity or potential misuse of the Office solution package mechanism.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
