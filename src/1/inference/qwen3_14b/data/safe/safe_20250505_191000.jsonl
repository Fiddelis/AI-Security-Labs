{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's SDXHelper.exe loading several DLLs like combase.dll, urlmon.dll, and others. Wait, those are system DLLs, right? But they're being loaded by SDXHelper.exe. Hmm, but I know that some legitimate processes do load these, so maybe that's normal. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and a GUID. That might be normal, but sometimes attackers use rundll32 to execute malicious code. However, the command line here seems to be a standard one, maybe part of a legitimate process. Not sure yet.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a log file, probably part of the software's normal operation. The EXCEL.EXE process is opening a CSV file, which is normal. But then EXCEL.EXE is loading several DLLs, including amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. Loading that might be normal, but sometimes malware tries to disable AMSI by hooking into it. However, just loading it isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's WmiPrvSE.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process related to WMI. The command line here is -secured -Embedding, which might be part of a legitimate operation. The image loaded is wmiutils.dll, which is part of WMI as well.\n\nLooking at the other events, there are some User Account Management tasks and a Logon event. Those might be part of normal user activity. The Registry value set events by svchost.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe could be normal, but sometimes registry changes are used by malware to persist.\n\nNow, the key thing here is that SDXHelper.exe is loading several system DLLs multiple times. But since those are standard system DLLs, and the process is SDXHelper.exe, which might be a legitimate application (maybe related to some software like AMD's SDX?), it's possible that this is normal. However, if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that could be a red flag. But without more context on the process's origin, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the repetition of the same events. For example, the Image loaded events for combase.dll and urlmon.dll by SDXHelper.exe happening multiple times. That might be normal if the process is being restarted, but if it's part of a larger pattern, maybe not.\n\nAlso, there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper, so that's expected. The EXCEL.EXE process seems to be doing normal work, opening a CSV and loading necessary DLLs.\n\nConsidering all that, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. The events are mostly normal system processes and legitimate activities. The repeated ImageLoad events for system DLLs might not be suspicious on their own. So, the classification here would be NOT INTERESTING, as there's no obvious malicious behavior detected in the batch.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events primarily show legitimate system activity, including standard DLL loading by known processes (e.g., EXCEL.EXE, rundll32.exe) and benign file operations (e.g., winlogbeat.exe creating log files). No suspicious patterns, unexpected process behaviors, or indicators of compromise are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll look through the events.\n\nMost of the entries have \"winlog\" with task \"User Account Management\" and no process or file info. That might be normal system activity, but not necessarily suspicious. Then there are a few entries involving EXCEL.EXE. Let me check those.\n\nOne event says \"Image loaded\" with coml2.dll. Wait, coml2.dll is part of the Windows COM library, right? But why is Excel loading it? Maybe that's normal, but sometimes malicious software can load DLLs from unexpected places. However, the path here is C:\\Windows\\System32\\coml2.dll, which is the standard location. So maybe that's okay.\n\nThen there are multiple \"File created\" events with a .LNK file in the Recent folder. The user fiddelis has this file. .LNK files are shortcuts, and creating them in the Recent folder might be part of normal Excel operations, like saving a file. But creating a shortcut named real_values.csv.LNK could be a red flag if it's not expected. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same file is created twice, so maybe it's a legitimate action, like saving a file multiple times.\n\nThen there are several \"Dns query\" events from Excel. That could be normal if Excel is accessing external resources, but if there's a pattern of unusual domains or a high volume, that might be suspicious. However, the logs don't specify the domains queried, so I can't confirm that.\n\nThe other entries have \"task\": \"None\" and no process or file info. Those might be just noise or incomplete logs.\n\nPutting it all together, the main suspicious parts are the creation of the .LNK file and the DNS queries. But since the .LNK is in a standard location and the DNS queries don't have details, I'm not sure. The image loaded event is in a standard path, so maybe that's okay. However, the repetition of events and the presence of multiple file creations might indicate something. But without more context, like the user's normal behavior, it's hard to say. The confidence is medium. Maybe it's a false positive, but there are enough unusual events to warrant further investigation. So classification is INTERESTING with medium confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events involving EXCEL.EXE creating a .LNK file in the Recent folder and performing DNS queries may indicate suspicious activity, though not definitively malicious. The repetition of similar events warrants further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
