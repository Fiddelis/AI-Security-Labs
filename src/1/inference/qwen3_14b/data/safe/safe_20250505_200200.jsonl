{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's a legitimate activity if someone is installing software. But then there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and creating files. The file paths include temporary directories and some .ps1 files, which are PowerShell scripts. Creating and then deleting a script might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers do that to avoid leaving traces.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are several .dll files from Microsoft.NET and Windows Defender. Those are standard, but the fact that they're being loaded by PowerShell could be normal if PowerShell is running managed code. However, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks might be normal PowerShell operations, but I should check for any anomalies.\n\nThe user mentioned that the same file (.winlogbeat.yml.new) is being created multiple times by winlogbeat.exe. That's probably part of the software's configuration process. However, the presence of ssh.exe creating a file in the .ssh directory is normal for SSH key management. The network connection detected by ssh.exe is also typical.\n\nBut wait, there's a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a red flag because attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious scripts and then delete them to cover their tracks. The fact that it's a .ps1 file suggests it's a PowerShell script. Even though it's deleted, the event of creation and deletion might indicate something malicious.\n\nAlso, the multiple ImageLoad events for various DLLs could be normal, but if there's an unexpected DLL or one not typically loaded by PowerShell, that could be suspicious. However, the ones listed here are all legitimate system DLLs.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the creation and deletion of the PowerShell script in the Temp directory. That behavior is often seen in malicious activities. Even though other events are normal, the combination of these actions might indicate an attempt to execute a script and then remove evidence. However, without more context, like the content of the script or other unusual activities, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of that specific file operation is enough to flag this as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell process events show file creation and deletion in temporary directories, which is often associated with malicious script execution and cleanup. The repeated creation of .ps1 files followed by deletion suggests potential隐蔽 execution of malicious code.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_200200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze these logs. The first batch has multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a lot of image loading, which is normal for PowerShell, but there's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That could be a red flag, like a script trying to execute something temporarily. Also, the repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" events might indicate something unusual, but they could just be normal operations.\n\nThen there's the winlogbeat.exe creating files in the Downloads directory, which might be part of a legitimate installation or configuration. However, the same file is created multiple times, which might be normal if it's updating a configuration file. The ssh.exe activities seem benign, like creating a known_hosts file and network connections, which are typical for SSH usage.\n\nLooking at the second batch, svchost.exe is creating files in the XboxLive directory. That's a bit unusual because svchost.exe is a generic host process for Windows services. Creating files in system directories like XboxLive might be part of a legitimate service, but it's worth checking if there's any unexpected activity here. However, the files mentioned (AuthStateCache.dat) are known files related to Xbox Live authentication, so this might be normal.\n\nOverall, the first batch has more suspicious activities with PowerShell's temporary file creation and deletion, along with multiple image loads that might be part of a script. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. The confidence is moderate because there are some indicators that could be benign or malicious. The second batch seems more normal. So, the combined logs have some potential issues but not conclusive evidence of a security threat.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs contain a mix of **normal system activity** and **potentially suspicious behavior**, warranting further investigation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n#### **1. PowerShell.exe Activity (Suspicious Indicators):**\n- **File Creation\/Deletion in Temp Directory:**\n  - A temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1`) is created and immediately deleted in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`. This could indicate **script execution** (e.g., for policy testing or malicious payload delivery).\n  - **Why it matters:** Temporary files are often used by malware to execute payloads without leaving permanent traces.\n\n- **Repeated \"Provider Lifecycle\" Events:**\n  - Multiple entries with task `\"Provider Lifecycle\"` (likely related to PowerShell's internal engine). While normal, **high frequency** could suggest **script automation** or **exploitation** (e.g., PowerShell Empire or similar frameworks).\n\n- **Image Loads (Legitimate but Monitored):**\n  - PowerShell loads system DLLs (e.g., `urlmon.dll`, `MpOAV.dll`, `MpClient.dll`). These are **legitimate** but could be **abused** in attacks (e.g., leveraging Defender components for persistence).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Winlogbeat.exe & Ssh.exe Activity (Likely Benign):**\n- **Winlogbeat.exe** creates `.winlogbeat.yml.new` in the Downloads directory. This is **normal** for configuration updates (e.g., log shipping tools).\n- **Ssh.exe** creates `known_hosts` and establishes network connections. This is **typical for SSH usage** (e.g., remote access or DevOps workflows).\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Svchost.exe Activity (Needs Context):**\n- **File creation in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\XboxLive\\`** (e.g., `AuthStateCache.dat`). \n  - **Possibly legitimate** if related to Xbox Live authentication (e.g., gaming services or Microsoft account sync).\n  - **Suspicious if unexpected**, as `svchost.exe` is a generic host for Windows services and should not directly create user-specific files.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low-Moderate Risk:** The PowerShell activity raises **moderate concern** due to temporary file creation\/deletion and repeated engine events. However, these could be **legitimate** (e.g., script testing or system updates).\n- **No Clear Malware Indicators:** No obvious malware hashes, network exfiltration, or anomalous process trees are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Investigate PowerShell Scripts:**\n   - Check if `__PSScriptPolicyTest_raz5sdjq.utt.ps1` or similar scripts are part of **approved automation** or **unauthorized activity**.\n   - Monitor for **unusual PowerShell commands** (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`).\n\n2. **Analyze svchost.exe Behavior:**\n   - Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **Windows Event Logs** to confirm if `svchost.exe` is acting as expected (e.g., hosting `XboxGip.exe` or other legitimate services).\n\n3. **Correlate with Network Traffic:**\n   - Check if SSH or PowerShell-related processes are communicating with **unusual external IPs** or **malicious domains**.\n\n4. **Review System Updates:**\n   - Ensure `winlogbeat.exe` and other tools are **up to date** and configured securely.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs show **no definitive signs of compromise**, but the **PowerShell activity** and **svchost.exe file creation** merit closer scrutiny. Further analysis (e.g., endpoint logs, network traffic) is needed to rule out **script-based attacks** or **unauthorized configuration changes**."}
