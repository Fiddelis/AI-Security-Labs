From what I remember, SDXHelper is part of the Microsoft Office suite, possibly related to the Office Deployment Tool or some kind of package management. However, I should verify that. If it's a legitimate process, then creating these JavaScript files might be part of a normal operation, like installing or updating Office components.\n\nBut wait, the filenames have a specific pattern.

Usually, legitimate software doesn't create so many files in such a short time, especially with different hashes each time. That might indicate something like a dropper or malware generating files.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages. That's a bit unusual. I know that some malware uses AppData for persistence, but Office's directories might be more targeted. The repeated creation of files with similar names but different hashes could be part of a larger payload or data exfiltration. \n\nAlso, the presence of \"vendors~\" in some filenames might be a clue. That could be part of a package name, but in a malicious context, it might be obfuscation. The hashes are unique, which might be used to avoid detection. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut wait, maybe this is part of a legitimate Office update or some add-in. However, the repetition and the specific directory structure make me think it's more likely malicious. The fact that the same process is creating multiple files in different package directories could indicate a staged attack. \n\nI should also consider if there are any known threats related to SDXHelper.exe. If I recall correctly, there have been some malicious tools with similar names. However, without a threat intelligence check, I can't be certain. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation, but not enough to confirm it's definitely malicious.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. The files have names that look like they could be part of some Office add-ins or packages, given the paths and the naming conventions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if these events are suspicious. The process name is SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process, but I know that legitimate processes can sometimes have unusual names. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in the Office SolutionPackages directory might be normal if this is part of an Office add-on or update. But then again, malicious software can also hide in such directories.\n\nLooking at the file names, they have parts like \"vendors~file-link-plugin.js\" and \"excel-copilot-strings\". The \"vendors\" part might be related to third-party libraries, which is common in web applications. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files being created by SDXHelper.exe could indicate that this process is part of a legitimate Office solution, perhaps a new add-in or a package being installed. But since the user is asking for potential malicious behavior, I need to check if there's anything unusual here.\n\nOne thing to note is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, \"vendors~file-link-plugin.js\" appears twice. That might be a red flag if it's repeatedly creating the same files, but maybe it's just part of the installation process. However, if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, then this might be normal. But if it's not, then it could be malicious.\n\nAnother point is the directory structure. The files are in \"OfflineFiles\" under \"PackageResources\". This seems specific to Office solutions, which might be a legitimate location. However, I should also consider that attackers sometimes use legitimate directories to store malicious files. But without more context, like other events or processes involved, it's hard to say.\n\nI should also check if SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process. A quick mental note: I don't recall SDXHelper.exe being a standard Microsoft process. It might be part of a third-party application or a new Office add-on. However, the fact that it's creating multiple JavaScript files in such a specific path could be indicative of a legitimate package or possibly a malicious one trying to inject code.\n\nConsidering the repetition of the same files being created, maybe it's part of a package installation that's being repeated. But if this is happening frequently or without user interaction, that could be suspicious. However, the batch provided here just shows these events without context on timing or other processes. \n\nThe justification for classification would depend on whether these activities are typical for SDXHelper.exe. If there's no prior knowledge of this process being malicious, but the file creation is in a non-standard location or involves unusual file names, that could be a concern. However, given the paths, it's possible that this is related to Office solutions, which might involve such files.\n\nIn the absence of additional indicators like network activity, process injection, or other suspicious behaviors, the classification might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" if these are legitimate package installations. But if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, then it might be \"INTERESTING\". However, since the user hasn't provided other events, and the files are in a location associated with Office packages, I might err on the side of caution and consider it as not interesting unless there's more context.

The files are named with a pattern like excel-copilot-strings followed by a hash or some random string.\n\nHmm, SDXHelper.exe – I'm not too familiar with that process. Maybe it's part of some Office add-in or tool? But why are there so many files being created? Each entry is duplicated, like the same file being created twice. That might be a red flag.

JavaScript in such directories might be used for malicious purposes, like scripting attacks or data exfiltration.\n\nAnother thing is the presence of MdSched.exe changing a registry value. That's a different process, and registry changes can be a sign of malware trying to persist or alter system settings. But there's only one event related to that.

But maybe it's just logging the same event twice? Not sure. \n\nThen there's one event where cleanmgr.exe is run. Cleanmgr is the Disk Cleanup tool, which is a legitimate process. But why is it here? Maybe the user ran it manually, or it's part of a cleanup routine. However, in the context of the other events, it might not be directly related unless there's a connection. \n\nNow, considering the classification. The key points are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory, possibly related to Office, and the repetition of file names. If SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, this might be normal. However, if it's a malicious process, this could be part of downloading or executing malicious code. \n\nBut wait, the file paths are in the user's AppData folder under Microsoft Office. That's a common location for Office add-ins and packages. So maybe this is part of an Office 365 update or a custom add-in. However, the sheer number of files being created might be unusual. Also, the fact that all the files are JavaScript might be a concern because JavaScript in that context is typically for web-based add-ins, not local execution. But maybe they are part of an Office add-in's resources. \n\nAnother angle: the process name SDXHelper.exe. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. If I recall, Microsoft does have some helper processes, but I'm not certain about SDXHelper. Maybe it's part of the Office setup or deployment tools. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe presence of multiple files with similar names might indicate a package being expanded, but again, that's speculative. The fact that the same file is created multiple times might be a sign of a problem, like a failed operation or a loop. \n\nPutting it all together: the batch shows multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a Microsoft Office-related directory. While this could be legitimate, the repetition and the number of files might suggest something unusual. However, without more context, like other suspicious activities or known malware signatures, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut the user is asking for a classification. Given that the files are in a legitimate location but the process name isn't immediately recognizable as a standard Microsoft process, and considering the repetition, I think this is worth investigating. So, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6. The justification is the multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in an Office directory, which might be benign but warrants further investigation to confirm legitimacy.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with JavaScript extensions are created in a Microsoft Office-related directory by SDXHelper.exe, which is not a standard Office process.

The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.6, because while the process is legitimate, the pattern is unusual and could indicate a problem.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, suggesting potential benign update activity or possible malicious mimicry of legitimate Office processes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a file creation event by SDXHelper.exe. The first thing I notice is that the same files are being created multiple times. For example, the file \"officeaicopilotchatstrings_af_...\" is listed twice, and \"word-copilot.min_...\" appears a few times as well. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a process I recognize off the top of my head. Typically, legitimate processes from Microsoft Office might have names related to Office or specific components, but SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring a bell. That's a red flag. Also, the file paths are all within the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory, which is a legitimate location for some Office-related files, but the filenames include hashes and seem to be JavaScript files. \n\nWait, the filenames have parts like \"officeaicopilotchatstrings\" and \"word-copilot.min\". Copilot is a feature in Office, so maybe these are related to that. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might indicate something's wrong. If these files are being created by a legitimate process, you'd expect them to be created once during installation or updates. Repeated creation could suggest that the process is being exploited or that there's a loop.\n\nAnother thing is the hashes in the filenames. The hashes might be unique identifiers, but if the same hash is used across different files, that could be a sign of something malicious. However, I can't verify that without checking the actual content. But given that the same process is creating the same files multiple times, and the process name isn't standard, this seems suspicious. \n\nAlso, considering the directory structure, the files are placed in OfflineFiles, which might be part of Office's offline installation or resource management. But again, repeated creation could be an issue. \n\nI should check if there are any known malicious activities associated with SDXHelper.exe. From what I recall, there aren't many reports, but that doesn't mean it's safe. The key here is the repetition and the unusual process name. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple file creations by a non-standard process, same files being created multiple times, and the files being in a legitimate but possibly exploited directory. This could be a sign of a malicious activity, like a dropper or a component of malware. However, without more context like other events (e.g., network activity, process execution, or registry changes), it's a bit hard to be certain. But based on the given data, it's enough to flag it as interesting for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical file creation events by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, with filenames containing hashes and copilot-related strings.

{"file":"data\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, all showing files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some Office add-in or copilot feature, given the \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and \"word-copilot\" in the filenames.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is suspicious. SDXHelper.exe – I'm not immediately familiar with that process. Maybe it's a legitimate part of some software, but I should check. The files are being created in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. That's a known location where Office might store add-ins or solutions, so maybe that's normal. However, the fact that multiple files are being created with different hash-like suffixes might indicate something. \n\nWait, the filenames have parts like \"min_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js\" – those look like hashes. That could be a way to uniquely identify different versions of the files. But why so many? Are they all part of a legitimate update or installation? Alternatively, could this be malware dropping files into that directory?\n\nAnother thing to note is that all the events are from SDXHelper.exe. If that's a legitimate process, then creating these files might be normal. But if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process, that's a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Also, the fact that the same files are being created multiple times (like the officeaicopilot-strings.min_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js appears twice) might be redundant, but maybe that's part of the process.\n\nI should also consider the directory structure. The SolutionPackages folder is part of Office's structure for storing add-ins. If the user has Office 365 or some version that uses these packages, this might be normal. However, the presence of multiple packages with different IDs (like 82bbdf66d0747b40d35eebf84d2937b and 8988909c18d8bf3dd4c823acc260243c) suggests that these could be different add-ins or updates. But again, without knowing the user's environment, it's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the process name SDXHelper.exe. Maybe that's related to some software development kit or helper tool. But if it's not a known process, that's suspicious. However, the user hasn't provided any other events, like process creation or network activity, so it's hard to tell if this is part of a larger attack.\n\nConsidering all that, the logs show multiple file creations by the same process in a legitimate directory, but the lack of other context makes it hard to determine. However, the repetition of the same files being created might be normal, but the presence of multiple unique files with hash-like names could be a sign of something. Since the user is asking to classify the batch, and there's no obvious malicious activity (like network connections, unusual process behavior, etc.), but also no clear indication that this is normal, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence. The justification would be that multiple files are being created by SDXHelper.exe in a location associated with Office add-ins, which could be legitimate but might also be part of an attack if SDXHelper is not a known good process.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with hash-like suffixes are created by SDXHelper.exe in Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory, which may indicate legitimate add-in deployment or potential malicious activity if SDXHelper.exe is not a known legitimate process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
