The path is `node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash\/fp`, which is a standard directory structure for TypeScript types in a project. But again, if git is the process creating them, that's not typical.

However, without additional context, like other suspicious activities or unexpected network connections, it's hard to say.

Git is a common tool for version control, so creating files during a git operation might be normal. But why so many files being created? Let me think about typical git activities. When you clone a repository or pull changes, git might create files, but usually, it's part of the repository's structure. However, these files are all TypeScript type declarations, which are part of the project's dependencies, specifically for Cypress and Lodash.\n\nWait, the path is in the node_modules directory. That's where npm packages are installed. If the user is working on a project that uses Cypress and Lodash, these files might be part of the installed packages. But why are they being created by git? Maybe the user is initializing a new project, or maybe they're syncing with a remote repository that includes these files. Alternatively, could this be a sign of something malicious?\n\nBut looking at the process name, it's git.exe. If an attacker had compromised the system, they might use git to download malicious files. However, the files here are standard TypeScript types. The names like min.d.ts, methodOf.d.ts, etc., are typical for Lodash's FP (functional programming) module. So this seems like normal package installation or project setup.\n\nAnother angle: are there any unusual patterns? All events are from git.exe, same task \"File created\", same directory structure. That's consistent with a single operation, like cloning or pulling. No other processes involved, no unexpected file types. The confidence here would be low for malicious activity because it's all standard. However, maybe the user is not expecting git to create so many files in node_modules. But in reality, when you install packages via npm, node_modules gets populated with many files, and git might track those if they're in the repo. However, usually, node_modules is excluded from git repos via .gitignore. So if these files are being created by git, perhaps the user has a .gitignore that's not properly set up, leading git to track node_modules. But that's more of a configuration issue than a security threat.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is not the owner of the repository and these files are being created by an unauthorized git operation, that could be a problem. But the logs don't indicate any unauthorized access or unusual user activity.

That's where npm packages are installed. The presence of cypress and lodash suggests that the user is working on a project that uses these tools. Cypress is a testing framework, and lodash is a utility library. The 'fp' in the path stands for 'functional programming' utilities in lodash.\n\nNow, considering the number of files being created. There are 16 entries here, each for a different .d.ts file. If this is part of a normal installation or update process, it might be expected. However, if git.exe is creating these files, that's a bit unusual. Normally, npm or yarn would handle installing packages and their type definitions. Git is more about version control, so maybe there's a misconfiguration or something else going on.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is using git to clone a repository that includes these files. If the repository has a lot of TypeScript definitions in the node_modules, that could be why. However, typically, node_modules are not tracked by git, so having git create files there might be a red flag. It could indicate that the user is trying to commit node_modules, which is not standard practice. Alternatively, maybe the files are being generated by a build process, but again, that's usually handled by other tools.\n\nAnother angle: are these files part of a legitimate development workflow?

Each entry has a file path that ends with .d.ts, which are TypeScript declaration files. The paths all point to the node_modules directory under a Cypress project.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that all these files are being created by git.exe. But wait, git is typically used for version control. Creating TypeScript files doesn't sound like something git would do normally. Maybe the user is using git to clone a repository that includes these TypeScript files, which are part of the project's dependencies, like Cypress and lodash.\n\nLooking at the file paths, they're all in the node_modules folder. That's where npm packages are installed. If the user ran an npm install or a similar command, it's possible that these files are part of the installed packages. However, the events are all about files being created. Normally, during an npm install, files are extracted, but maybe the system's logging is capturing each file creation as part of the installation process.\n\nBut why would this be interesting? Well, if there's a lot of file creation events from git.exe in node_modules, it might be unusual. However, considering that the files are .d.ts files from lodash and Cypress, which are common dependencies, this might just be part of a normal development setup. Unless there's a pattern here that suggests something malicious, like unexpected files or unusual activity outside of typical package management.\n\nWait, the classification needs to be whether this is interesting for investigation. If all these events are part of a legitimate process, like installing dependencies, then it's not interesting. But if there's something off, like git.exe creating files in node_modules when it shouldn't, that could be a red flag. However, in this case, the files are part of the expected structure. So maybe the answer is that it's not interesting. But I should check if there's any other angle. For example, if the user is using git to manage the node_modules, which is not standard. But typically, git isn't used for that. However, if they're using git in a different way, maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's file creation rule is triggering for each file, which could be a lot, but if it's part of a normal install, then it's not a security issue. So the confidence here would be low because it's likely normal activity. Therefore, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.2 or something, since there's no clear malicious intent here.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent legitimate file creation by git.exe during TypeScript declaration file installation in a Cypress project's node_modules directory.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. All the events are about files being created by git.exe in the node_modules directory under cypress\/types\/lodash. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should think about what git.exe typically does. Git is a version control system, so it's common for it to create files during operations like cloning repositories or checking out branches. The files mentioned are TypeScript declaration files (like .d.ts), which are part of the TypeScript ecosystem. These are usually generated when installing packages that include type definitions, such as those in node_modules.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all within a specific project directory: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\inatel\\S206... This seems like a user's local development environment. The presence of node_modules suggests that this is part of a project setup, possibly using npm or yarn for package management. The lodash files are part of the Cypress testing framework's type definitions, which are standard in a React or JavaScript project.\n\nNow, are there any red flags here? The files are being created by git.exe, but if the user is actively using git to manage their project, this is normal. However, sometimes attackers might use git to exfiltrate data or inject malicious code. But in this case, all the files are standard type definitions, and there's no indication of unusual activity beyond normal file creation during a git operation.\n\nAnother point: the classification is based on the entire batch. All events are similar, so they might be part of a single operation, like a git checkout or pull. Since there's no variation in the process or unexpected file types, it's likely benign. The confidence here would be high that it's not malicious, so the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events represent normal file creation operations by git.exe during version control activities, with file paths corresponding to standard TypeScript declaration files in a typical development environment.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250418_134701.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, each indicating that a file was created by git.exe. The files are all TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) located in the node_modules\/cypress\/types\/lodash directory. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior. Git is typically used for version control, but when you run git commands, it might create or modify files. However, the files mentioned here are part of the node_modules directory, which is where npm packages are installed. \n\nWait, if someone is using Git in a project that has node_modules, maybe they're committing those files? But normally, node_modules are excluded from version control because they're generated by npm. So if git is creating files in node_modules, that might not be standard. However, looking at the file names, they're all .d.ts files, which are TypeScript type definitions. These are part of the Cypress and Lodash packages. \n\nAnother angle: are these files being created as part of a normal Git operation? For example, if someone is adding new files to the repository. But the path is inside node_modules, which is usually not part of the repository. So if git is creating files there, maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps a malicious activity. \n\nBut wait, the user might be working on a project that includes these TypeScript files. Maybe they're part of a development setup where Git is being used to track changes in the node_modules, which is not typical. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a short period could be a red flag. \n\nAlternatively, if these files are part of a legitimate process, like installing a package that includes these types, but that would usually be done via npm, not Git. So, maybe the user ran a Git command that somehow generated these files. \n\nBut considering that all the events are from git.exe and the files are in the same directory structure, it might be a false positive. However, the classification here is whether it's interesting for investigation. Since these files are in node_modules, which is typically not under version control, and Git creating files there might indicate an unusual activity. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user is using Git to manage their project and accidentally added these files, but that's less likely. The confidence here would depend on how common it is for Git to create files in node_modules. Since it's not standard, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6 or 0.7. But I need to check if there's any other indication of malicious behavior. \n\nLooking at the file names again, they all seem to be legitimate TypeScript files from Lodash and Cypress. So maybe this is just a normal operation, but the location in node_modules is suspicious. However, if the user is working on a project that includes these files, maybe it's okay. \n\nHmm, the justification would be that the events show git.exe creating multiple TypeScript files in a node_modules directory, which is not typical. However, without more context, it's hard to say if it's malicious. But the fact that multiple files are being created in that directory by Git might be worth investigating. So the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence of around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files in the node_modules directory are being created by git.exe, which is unusual as node_modules are typically managed by package managers (e.g., npm) rather than Git.
