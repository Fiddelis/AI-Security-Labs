So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is that all the events are related to file creation by SDXHelper.exe in specific paths under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. \n\nFirst, I notice that almost all the events are about creating JavaScript files named officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. The process is always SDXHelper.exe, which I think is part of Microsoft's Office apps, maybe related to updates or package management. But why so many files being created? Also, there are duplicates in the file paths, like the same file being created twice. That might be normal if it's part of a package deployment, but maybe not.\n\nThen there's one event about chrome.exe setting a registry value. That seems unrelated to the rest. But maybe that's just a normal activity. However, the main focus here is on the repeated file creations. \n\nNow, considering that these files are in the OfflineFiles directory under SolutionPackages, it could be part of an Office add-in or update. However, the high number of files and the repetition might indicate something unusual. But I need to check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. If it's a legitimate process, then this might be normal. But if it's malware, then creating many files could be a red flag. \n\nWait, the files are all JavaScript files with minified names. That's common for web apps, but in the context of Office, maybe not. Also, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might be part of versioning. However, the fact that so many files are created in a short time could be suspicious. But without more context, like other events or known bad indicators, it's hard to say. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. If these are all legitimate, then it's not interesting. But if the process is not supposed to be creating these files, then it's a problem. Since the user hasn't provided any other context, like if SDXHelper.exe is known malicious, I have to rely on the data given. \n\nThe presence of multiple file creations by the same process in a specific directory might be normal for some operations, but it's also a possible sign of data exfiltration or something else. However, without seeing other malicious activities or known bad indicators, the confidence is moderate.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON events, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to analyze the entire batch together.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files located in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The names of the files have hashes in them, which might be normal for resource files, but creating multiple files with similar names could be a red flag. However, I should check if this is part of a legitimate Office update or installation. \n\nThen, there are a few events from chrome.exe where registry values are being set. Chrome modifying the registry isn't unusual, but the lack of file details here might be a concern. However, since there are only three such events and they're all from chrome.exe, maybe they're part of normal operations.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: SDXHelper.exe creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory. If these files are part of a legitimate Office package, they might be expected. However, the repetition of the same file names (like min_a97a3b3b45b83dda327cdb2b00b9f984.js appearing twice) could indicate something off. Also, the presence of multiple files with different hashes might be part of a larger package, but it's worth checking if the user has any Office installations happening around that time.\n\nHowever, the main point here is that all the file creation events are from SDXHelper.exe, which is a known process for Microsoft Office, so this might be part of a legitimate update. But if there's no corresponding user activity or if these files are being created in an unusual context, that could be suspicious. However, based solely on the logs provided, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe chrome.exe registry events don't seem to tie into the SDXHelper activities. They might be separate. Since the majority of events are from SDXHelper and the files are in a legitimate Office directory, maybe this is not malicious. But the repetition of file creation could be a sign of something else. However, without more indicators like unexpected network activity or other processes involved, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the processes involved are known (SDXHelper and chrome), and the file paths are within expected directories for Office. Unless there's a known malicious activity associated with these files, which isn't indicated here, it's probably just normal system activity. The confidence is around 0.6 because there's some repetition, but not enough to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (SDXHelper.exe for Office updates, chrome.exe for registry operations) and file paths within standard Office directories.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created several JavaScript files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The first thing I notice is that all the files have names starting with \"officeaicopilot-strings.min\" followed by a hash. That seems a bit odd because typical legitimate files might have more predictable naming conventions, maybe version numbers or dates. The hashes here look like they could be unique identifiers, which might be normal for some packaging systems, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNext, I check the process involved: SDXHelper.exe. I'm not immediately familiar with this process. A quick mental checkâ€”common legitimate processes usually have names related to known software, like svchost.exe, explorer.exe, or ones from Microsoft. SDXHelper.exe doesn't ring a bell as a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of some third-party software or a newer Office add-in? But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the fact that it's creating multiple files in a specific directory might be suspicious.\n\nThe directory path is within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. That's a part of the Office installation, so maybe it's related to some Office solution or add-in. However, the creation of so many JavaScript files in that location could be unusual. Legitimate add-ins might install files there, but typically not so many, especially with those hash-based names. It's possible that these files are part of a legitimate update or package, but the repetition and the specific naming might indicate something else.\n\nLooking at the hashes, there are duplicates. For example, the same file name appears twice with the same hash. That might be normal if the same file was created multiple times, but in the context of a package, maybe that's expected. However, the sheer number of files created by a single process could be a red flag. Malware sometimes creates multiple files in temporary or user-specific directories to avoid detection.\n\nAnother point is that all the events are FileCreate rules triggered by SDXHelper.exe. If this process is legitimate, it might be part of a setup or installation that requires creating multiple files. But if it's malicious, this could be part of a data exfiltration or persistence mechanism. However, the files are JavaScript, which are more commonly used for client-side scripting, so maybe they're part of a web-based component. But why so many?\n\nI should also consider the possibility that this is a false positive. Maybe SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process that's part of a newer Office feature or a third-party tool that's being used. Without more information on the process's reputation or the user's environment, it's challenging to determine. However, the combination of an uncommon process name, the location of the files, and the large number of created files with hash-based names raises some concerns.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'd say there's a moderate chance this is interesting. The indicators aren't definitive proof of malicious activity, but they do warrant further investigation. The justification would be the unusual process name, the location of the files, and the high volume of created files with non-standard names. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior (like network activity or execution of suspicious code), it's not a high-confidence alert. So, I'd classify this as INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.6.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple JavaScript files with hash-based names are created in a non-standard Office directory by an uncommon process (SDXHelper.exe), which may indicate suspicious packaging or obfuscation techniques.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see multiple entries where the process SDXHelper.exe is creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are all JavaScript files with names that look like they might be part of some package resources. There are several entries with the same file paths, which might indicate duplication or maybe a mistake in logging. \n\nThen there's an entry involving chrome.exe loading BitsProxy.dll, which is a legitimate Windows system file. That seems normal, so probably not a red flag there.\n\nLooking at the SDXHelper.exe activity again, the files are being created in a specific subdirectory under AppData. Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages directory is typically used for storing solution packages, but the presence of multiple JavaScript files named with hashes might be unusual. However, I should check if this is part of a legitimate Office update or installation. \n\nWait, the files are named with hashes and have the .min extension, which is common for minified JavaScript files. That could be part of a legitimate package, but the repetition of the same file names might be a sign of something else. Also, the process creating these files is SDXHelper.exe. I need to check if that's a known legitimate process. \n\nSDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Office Deployment Tool or some Office-related processes. So, if this is part of an Office installation or update, it might be normal. However, the large number of files created could be suspicious. But considering that Office might have multiple resources, maybe it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there's a winlogbeat.exe process creating a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of configuration changes, which is normal if the user is managing logs. However, the presence of this event alongside the SDXHelper activities might not be directly related unless there's a connection between the two.\n\nNow, considering the classification. If all these events are part of legitimate Office operations, then it's not interesting. But if SDXHelper.exe is creating a large number of files in a non-standard way, that could be suspicious. However, the repetition of the same file names might be a duplicate log entry rather than actual events. Also, the fact that some files are created multiple times (like the min_0d1ad4f1e67587dbd451127cb72e2305.js file appearing twice) could be a logging error, but maybe the system is just creating those files multiple times for some reason.\n\nI should also check if the file paths are within expected directories. The path C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages... is a legitimate location for Office-related files. However, the large number of JavaScript files might be out of the ordinary. But again, if this is part of an Office add-in or a package being installed, it could be normal.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the events are mostly legitimate, but the high volume of file creations by SDXHelper.exe might warrant further investigation. However, without more context or indicators of compromise (like unexpected network activity, process injections, or other anomalies), it's a bit hard to say. The presence of multiple identical file creations might be a red flag, but it could also be a logging artifact. \n\nGiven that, I might lean towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the processes involved are legitimate, and the activities are within expected directories. However, the high number of file creations could be a sign of something else, but without more evidence, it's safer to classify it as not interesting. The confidence would be around 0.6, as there's some ambiguity but no clear malicious indicators.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (SDXHelper.exe for Office operations, chrome.exe, winlogbeat.exe) creating files in expected directories (Office SolutionPackages, Downloads).

The files have names like officeaicopilot-strings.min with different hashes. That seems odd because SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Microsoft process. Usually, Microsoft Office-related files wouldn't be created by an executable named SDXHelper.exe. Also, creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles folder might be part of a malicious payload or data exfiltration.\n\nThen there's activity from chrome.exe handling a file named Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The logs show file creation, stream creation, and DNS queries. The Zone.Identifier file is a common marker for downloaded files, but the repeated stream creations and DNS queries might be part of normal operations. However, the presence of multiple FileCreateStreamHash events could indicate something trying to manipulate the file or inject content.\n\nLooking further, EXCEL.EXE is launched with the downloaded Excel file, and there are image loads from system DLLs like mscoreei.dll, mscoree.dll, and amsi.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's probably normal. But the fact that EXCEL.EXE is loading these might be part of the normal process of opening an Excel file, especially if it's a macro-enabled file. However, there's no mention of macros here, so maybe not.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe entry is creating a .yml.new file, which could be part of a configuration update, but that's probably benign unless there's a reason to suspect it's being tampered with. The svchost.exe entry with a registry change might be normal, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the SDXHelper.exe activity. Creating multiple JavaScript files in a specific directory isn't typical. Those files could be part of a malicious script or data collection. Since the user is asking about whether the batch is interesting for investigation, the repeated file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard location is a red flag.

That's interesting because SolutionPackages are typically used for Office add-ins. \n\nWait, the filenames are generated with hashes or random strings, which is common for some legitimate purposes, but the volume here is a bit high.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The files are named with language codes and seem to be UI string resources.

Like the es-es and es-mx ones are duplicated. Maybe that's just a coincidence, or maybe it's a sign of something else. However, the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is a known legitimate process.

The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: EXCEL.EXE is loading system DLLs like urlmon.dll and coml2.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that's normal. Then there's a file created in the Downloads folder named ~$Cronograma - 2025-1.xlsx. The tilde and dollar sign suggest it's a temporary file or a recovery file from Excel, which is common when editing documents. Not necessarily a red flag here.\n\nNext, svchost.exe has several registry value set events. svchost is a normal system process, but multiple registry changes could be a sign of something. However, without more context, like changes to specific keys or unexpected values, it's hard to tell. Maybe just part of normal operations.\n\nThen there's SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. The file names look like they're part of Office add-ins or solutions. The paths are deep within user-specific folders, which might be normal for Office operations. But creating multiple files with similar names might be worth checking. However, the file names include language codes and UI strings, which could be part of localization files. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, EXCEL.EXE creates a file stream with Zone.Identifier. That's typically a Windows feature to mark files as coming from a different zone (like the internet) to trigger security warnings. The presence of Zone.Identifier might indicate that the file was downloaded from the internet, which is normal, but if it's being created in a non-standard way, maybe not. However, the event here seems to be part of normal Excel operations when saving files, especially if they were downloaded.\n\nAnother entry has EXCEL.EXE loading combase.dll and VBEUI.DLL. Again, those are legitimate system files. The VBA DLL is part of the Visual Basic for Applications, which is used in Excel macros. If there were any suspicious activity related to macros, that might be a concern, but just loading the DLL isn't enough.\n\nThen there are multiple registry value set events from EXCEL.EXE. Excel might modify the registry for various reasons, like storing user preferences or settings. However, a large number of registry changes could be a sign of something, but again, without knowing the specific keys or values, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, most of the events are related to normal Excel operations, creating temporary files, loading legitimate DLLs, and some registry changes. The SDXHelper.exe activity seems to be part of Office's solution packages, which might be legitimate. The only thing that stands out a bit is the multiple registry changes from svchost and EXCEL.EXE, but those could be normal. There's no indication of malware or suspicious activity like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or unusual file creation in non-standard locations. The files created are either in expected directories (Downloads, AppData) or are temporary files. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. The events seem to be part of normal user operations with Excel and Office. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no evident threat here. But I should check if I missed anything. Maybe the repeated registry changes? But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

SDXHelper.exe might be part of some Office add-in or tool, but I should check if that's typical behavior.\n\nThen there's one event where EXCEL.EXE is setting a registry value. That's a different process. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if that's malicious. The other events are all about file creation. Now, the paths are all within the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office folder. That's a common place for Office to store temporary or solution packages. But the fact that multiple files are being created with different language codes might be part of a legitimate update or installation. However, the repetition of some files, like mk-mk-ui-strings-json being created twice, could be a red flag. Maybe a mistake in the logs, or maybe an attempt to overwrite or inject something.\n\nBut wait, the process is SDXHelper.exe. I need to check if that's a known legitimate process. A quick search in my mind: SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft's Office add-ins or solutions, possibly part of the Office Deployment Tool or something similar. If that's the case, then creating these files could be normal. However, if the process isn't supposed to be creating files in that directory, that's suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames end with .js, which are JavaScript files. If these are being created by SDXHelper.exe, maybe they're part of some script injection. But again, if it's part of a legitimate add-in, that's okay. The presence of multiple files with different language codes might be for localization, which is normal. However, the fact that they're all being created by the same process in a short time could be indicative of a malicious payload being deployed, especially if the files are not expected.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any other events, like network activity or other processes. So I can't confirm if this is part of a larger attack. The confidence here is a bit low because without more context, it's hard to say.

Then, there are a few entries from SDXHelper.exe with \"File created\" tasks, each pointing to specific file paths under the Microsoft Office SolutionPackages directory. The files have names like kok-in-ui-strings-json_e7dfbea71abb6781ead8c8671a96a5eb.js, which look like localization files for different languages.\n\nNow, considering the classification. The main thing here is that there's a lot of registry changes by Excel, but that alone isn't necessarily malicious. However, Excel is often used as a vector for malware, so multiple registry modifications might be a red flag. But then there's the SDXHelper.exe creating files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. SDXHelper.exe is related to Office add-ins or solutions, so creating files there might be part of legitimate operations, like installing a new add-in. However, the filenames are a bit generic and could be suspicious if they don't match known legitimate files. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the files are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles subdirectory. That seems like a standard path for Office to store resources. The filenames include hashes, which might be part of the package's unique identifiers. However, the repeated creation of such files by SDXHelper.exe might be normal during an Office solution deployment. \n\nOn the other hand, the numerous registry changes by Excel could be part of a macro or add-in modifying the registry. If this is happening in a normal user environment, it might be benign, but if it's an unusual number of changes, it could indicate something malicious. However, without more context, like the nature of the registry keys being modified, it's hard to say. \n\nThe combination of Excel modifying the registry multiple times and SDXHelper creating files in Office directories might be part of a legitimate process, like installing an Office add-in.

But since the justification needs to be concise, I should weigh the evidence. \n\nSo, the classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because of the combination of Excel's registry changes and the creation of files by SDXHelper in a specific path, which could indicate an Office add-in or potential malicious activity. But the confidence isn't extremely high because it's not definitive. Maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. Let me check again. \n\nThe registry events are all from Excel, which is a common tool for malware to execute macros. If this is a large number of events, it might be part of a malicious process. However, the file creation events are from SDXHelper, which is part of Office. The files created are in a known location, so maybe they're legitimate. But without more data, like the specific registry keys modified or the source of the files, it's hard to be certain. \n\nSo, the justification would be that there's a combination of Excel modifying the registry multiple times and SDXHelper creating files in an Office directory, which could be part of a legitimate process but might also indicate potential malicious activity. Therefore, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.65.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by EXCEL.EXE (potentially indicating macro activity) combined with SDXHelper.exe creating files in Office SolutionPackages directory (possibly related to add-ins or malicious payloads).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195500.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the events, most of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe. The files are all in specific directories under Microsoft Office SolutionPackages, and they have names like \"gu-in-ui-strings-json\" with various hashes. That seems a bit odd. Why are so many files being created in that location? Also, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't one I recognize immediately. Maybe it's part of Office, but I'm not sure. \n\nThen there's one event where winlogbeat.exe created a .yml.new file in the Downloads folder. That might be normal if someone is setting up a tool, but not sure yet. The rest are all SDXHelper.exe creating these JSON files. \n\nWait, but then there are several registry events from EXCEL.EXE and svchost.exe. Registry changes can be suspicious, especially if they're modifying keys that control system behavior. However, Excel and svchost are legitimate processes, so maybe they're just doing normal operations. But multiple registry events might indicate something more if they're related to persistence or configuration changes.\n\nNow, the key point here: the SDXHelper.exe is creating a lot of files in the Office SolutionPackages directory. That directory is typically used by Office for storing solution packages, but the names of the files here are language-specific UI strings. However, the hashes in the filenames are unique, which might be normal for different versions, but the repetition of the same process creating multiple files in the same directory could be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, looking closer, the first few events have the same file path repeated. Wait, no, looking again, each file has a different hash in the name. For example, gu-in-ui-strings-json_7b447acf7c7fa605c940eaf99f60e483.js, then he-il-ui-strings-json_9eaaacf9eea7ac8620661049c1dd2b16.js, etc. So each file has a unique hash. That might be normal if they're different language files. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating all these files might be part of a legitimate Office update or installation. \n\nBut then there's also the EXCEL.EXE making DNS queries and registry changes. DNS queries are normal, but combined with registry changes, it might be a sign of something. However, Excel doing registry changes could be part of normal operations, like updating settings or add-ins. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the presence of multiple registry events from svchost.exe. Svchost is a generic host process for Windows services, so if it's modifying the registry, that could be part of a service update. However, if there's a pattern here, maybe it's not normal. \n\nBut the main concern here is the SDXHelper.exe. If this process is not a known legitimate process, then creating multiple files in sensitive directories could be malicious. However, if it's part of a legitimate Office component, then it's okay. \n\nWait, I should check if SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process. From what I recall, SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, specifically related to the Solution Deployment feature. It's used for deploying solutions in SharePoint or Office add-ins. So, creating files in the SolutionPackages directory would be normal. \n\nIn that case, the events might be legitimate. However, the presence of multiple file creations could be part of a normal installation or update. The registry changes from Excel and svchost might be unrelated. \n\nBut why are there so many file creation events? Maybe the user is installing multiple language packs or solutions, which would explain the different language-specific files. The hashes in the filenames could be unique identifiers for each package. \n\nAlternatively, if the files were being created in a different directory or by a different process, that might be suspicious. But given that it's SDXHelper.exe and the Office directory, it's likely legitimate. \n\nThe only other event is the winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file could be part of its normal operation when setting up. \n\nPutting this all together, the events seem to be part of normal Office operations and configuration changes. Unless there's a known malicious activity associated with SDXHelper.exe, which I don't recall, this batch might not be interesting for investigation. \n\nHowever, the justification for \"NOT INTERESTING\" would be that the events are related to legitimate Office processes and normal system operations. The confidence is medium because while most events are normal, the high number of file creations could be a red flag, but without more context (like other malicious activities or known bad indicators), it's safer to classify as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show SDXHelper.exe creating language-specific UI string files in Microsoft Office directories, which aligns with legitimate Office solution deployment activities. Registry events from Excel and svchost.exe are consistent with normal system operations. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
