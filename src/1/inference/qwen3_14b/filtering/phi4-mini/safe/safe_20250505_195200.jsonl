{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are multiple entries here, all indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created several JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The first thing I notice is that the same process is creating a lot of files with similar names, each with different hashes in the filename. \n\nNow, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process that I'm familiar with. It might be part of some third-party software or maybe a legitimate tool, but I'm not sure. However, the fact that it's creating so many files in a specific directory could be a red flag. Usually, legitimate software doesn't create dozens of files in a short period, especially in a location like the Office SolutionPackages folder, which is typically used for Office add-ins or solutions.\n\nLooking at the filenames, they all start with \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\" followed by a hash. That seems suspicious because legitimate files might have version numbers or dates, but not random hashes. The repetition of the same filenames (like two entries for df97af4b9857e7a1bda26e9d98da31f2.js) might indicate that there's an attempt to overwrite or repeatedly create the same file, which could be part of a malicious process trying to hide its activity or test if the file is being monitored.\n\nAnother point is the directory structure. The files are being placed in the OfflineFiles subdirectory. If this is part of a legitimate Office solution, maybe the files are resources for an add-in. However, the sheer number of files and the use of hashes in the names make me think this might be something else. Malware often uses obfuscation techniques like hashing to avoid detection, and creating multiple files could be a way to distribute or execute malicious code.\n\nBut wait, I should consider that maybe this is part of a legitimate update or installation process. For example, if a new Office add-in is being deployed, it might generate a lot of resource files. However, the name \"excel-copilot-strings\" makes me think of Microsoft's Copilot feature, which is part of Office 365. If these files are part of a legitimate Copilot update, they might be placed in such directories. However, the use of hashes in the filenames is still unusual for standard updates. Typically, such files would have more predictable names.\n\nAlso, the process name SDXHelper.exe isn't something I recognize as a standard Microsoft process. Maybe it's part of a third-party application, but without more context, it's hard to tell. If this process is not known to be legitimate, that's a concern. Another angle is that the files are JavaScript files. While JavaScript can be part of legitimate Office add-ins, it's also commonly used in malicious scripts, especially if they're being executed in a browser or another context.\n\nConsidering all this, the combination of a non-standard process creating numerous files with hash-based names in a specific directory that's part of Office's structure is suspicious. However, without additional indicators like unusual process behavior, network activity, or other logs pointing to malware, it's a bit of a grey area.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/safe\/safe_20250505_195200.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together, not individually.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events are about files being created by a process called SDXHelper.exe. The files are all JavaScript files, and their paths are in the AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\SolutionPackages directory. The filenames have patterns like \"excel-copilot-strings\" followed by some random hash-like strings. That seems a bit odd. Why so many files with similar names and different hashes? Maybe they're part of a legitimate Office update or some package, but the sheer number might be suspicious.\n\nThen there are a couple of entries where consent.exe is loading amsi.dll and urlmon.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so that might not be a problem. But the fact that consent.exe is involved could be part of a normal process, like during installation or updates. However, I should check if there's anything unusual about how these files are being used.\n\nLooking at the paths again, the files are in the SolutionPackages folder under Office. That directory is typically used by Microsoft Office for storing solution packages, which might include add-ins or other components. However, the presence of multiple JavaScript files with those names might indicate that something is being deployed here. The hashes in the filenames could be part of versioning, but the large number of files (over 15 entries) might suggest an unusual amount of activity.\n\nWait, but SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. I should check if that's a known legitimate process. A quick recall: SDXHelper.exe is associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the Office Solution Deployment Tool. It's used for deploying and managing Office solutions. So, if this process is creating these files as part of a legitimate deployment, then it's normal. But if it's doing so in an unusual context or without user consent, that's a red flag.\n\nHowever, the logs don't show any other suspicious activities like network connections, registry changes, or privilege escalations. The only other processes mentioned are consent.exe (which is part of Windows' user consent dialog) and MdSched.exe, which is related to Windows' file system indexing. Those are all legitimate.\n\nSo, the key points here are: multiple file creations by SDXHelper.exe in a specific directory with JavaScript files named with hashes. If this is part of a legitimate Office update or deployment, then it's not interesting. But if the user hasn't initiated such an action, or if the files are not part of a known package, it could be malicious.\n\nBut the justification for classification needs to be based on the logs provided. Since the logs don't include any other suspicious activities, and SDXHelper.exe is a known process, maybe this is just a normal deployment. However, the high number of files and the specific naming might still be worth investigating, especially if the user isn't aware of this activity. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nHmm. The confidence level here is tricky. If I'm not sure, maybe a mid-range confidence. But considering that SDXHelper.exe is legitimate and the files are in a known directory, maybe it's not interesting. However, the high number of files and the pattern in the names could indicate something. I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the processes involved are legitimate, and there's no other suspicious activity. But I need to be cautious.

Its usual function is to handle the installation and deployment of Office solutions. However, creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory might be unusual. Normally, Office might use such files for localization or other resources, but the sheer number of files created here could be a red flag.\n\nI should check if the process SDXHelper.exe is legitimate. Yes, it's a known Microsoft process. But the key point here is the context of the file creation. If these files were created as part of a legitimate Office update or installation, they might be expected. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and hash-like identifiers might indicate something different. \n\nWait, but the filenames include \"excel-copilot-strings-n-tier\", which sounds like it could be related to Excel Copilot, a feature in newer Office versions. However, the hash part of the filename is suspicious. Legitimate files might have version numbers or other identifiers, but not random-looking hashes. Also, the fact that the same file is created twice (as seen in the logs) might be an error or a sign of duplication, which isn't typical in normal operations.\n\nAnother angle: the path is in the user's AppData Local Microsoft Office SolutionPackages. That's a common location for temporary or deployment files, but again, the number of files created here is high. It's possible that this is part of an Office update, but if this is happening frequently or without user initiation, it could be a sign of malicious activity. However, the process is legitimate, so it's a bit of a dilemma.\n\nBut wait, the justification for being interesting would be if there's a potential for malicious activity. Since SDXHelper.exe is a legitimate process, but the files created are numerous and have suspicious naming, it's possible that this is a legitimate activity. However, the high number of files and the repetition might indicate something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a false positive from the FileCreate rule, but that's less likely.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are the process name (legitimate), the location (legitimate), but the filenames and the number of files. If this is part of a normal Office installation, then it's not interesting.

The confidence here would be medium. But since the process is known and the location is expected, maybe it's not interesting. However, the repetition of the same file might be an error, but that's not necessarily malicious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the files are being created by a malicious process masquerading as SDXHelper.exe. But the logs don't indicate that. So, the classification is tricky.

Maybe that's a mistake, or maybe it's a repeated action. \n\nAlso, the hashes in the filenames could be used to obfuscate the actual purpose of the files. If these are malicious, they might be trying to avoid detection by using unique names each time. However, the fact that two events are identical might suggest that the system is logging the same file creation multiple times, which could be normal if the process is writing the file in parts or if there's a loop. \n\nBut considering that all three events are from the same process and the same directory, and the filenames have similar structures, this could be part of a malicious activity. Maybe the files are part of a payload or a script that's being injected. However, without more context like other events (like network activity, process creation, or registry changes), it's hard to be certain. \n\nThe classification here is tricky. The presence of SDXHelper.exe creating files in a non-standard way might be suspicious, but it's not definitive. The confidence is moderate. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of an unusual process name, the location of the files, and the naming pattern with hashes could indicate something malicious. But I can't be 100% sure without more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files with obfuscated names (hash-like patterns) are created by SDXHelper.exe in the Office SolutionPackages directory, which is unusual for legitimate Office operations. The process name and file naming patterns may indicate potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
