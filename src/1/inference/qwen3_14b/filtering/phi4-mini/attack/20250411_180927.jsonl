{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's powershell.exe and cmd.exe activities. The cmd.exe line stands out because it's adding a new user with the command \"net user \/add\" and then adding them to the administrators group. That's a red flag because creating new user accounts and adding them to admin groups can be part of privilege escalation or unauthorized access. \n\nThen there are multiple instances of net.exe and net1.exe being used to add users and modify groups. The use of net1.exe is unusual since the standard command is net.exe. The paths mentioned, like C:\\Windows\\system32\\net1, might be a typo or a malicious replacement. That's another suspicious point.\n\nLooking further, there's a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a new config file might be normal, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be part of setting up data exfiltration or configuring the tool for malicious purposes.\n\nOther entries involve registry changes and process accesses, but those are common in normal operations. However, the combination of user account modifications and the suspicious net1.exe usage raises concerns. The repeated registry value sets might be part of configuring the system for persistence or other malicious activities.\n\nThe presence of multiple user additions and group modifications suggests someone is trying to gain administrative privileges. This is a classic sign of a potential security breach. Even though some entries are normal (like Chrome and OneDrive), the overall pattern of modifying user accounts and using unusual executables points towards a possible attack.\n\nConfidence-wise, the combination of user account tampering and suspicious processes gives me a high confidence level, maybe around 0.85. The justification is the multiple attempts to add users and modify groups, along with the use of a potentially malicious executable (net1.exe).\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: creation of new user accounts (modulo_geral_Admin, modulo_principal_Admin) with weak passwords, addition of users to administrators group, and use of non-standard executable 'net1.exe' for network commands. These actions suggest potential privilege escalation or system compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180927.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first one is about chrome.exe loading amsi.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process like Chrome is loading it, that's normal. But maybe if it's being tampered with? However, the path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll, which is the correct location. So that might be okay.\n\nThen there are several entries where chrome.exe is setting registry values. Multiple times, but no files are mentioned. Setting registry values isn't inherently bad, but if it's done repeatedly, maybe there's something going on. However, Chrome does interact with the registry for various purposes, like settings and extensions. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is malicious.\n\nAnother event is about winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a legitimate tool for collecting and forwarding logs. The file path seems to be part of its installation or configuration, so that's probably normal. Then there's a file creation by powershell.exe, which is common for scripts. The file name is \"componente_secundario.txt\" – that's just a text file, so not necessarily suspicious.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern: most events are from chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which are legitimate. The only potential red flag is the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, but without more data, like unusual registry keys or other malicious activities, it's hard to say. The amsi.dll load seems normal. The other events don't show signs of malware or suspicious behavior. So maybe this isn't interesting enough for investigation. But I need to be careful – maybe the repeated registry changes are a sign of something. However, since there's no other suspicious activity, I'd lean towards not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show normal process behavior (chrome.exe loading amsi.dll, registry changes by chrome.exe, and legitimate file creation by winlogbeat.exe\/powershell.exe). No clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
