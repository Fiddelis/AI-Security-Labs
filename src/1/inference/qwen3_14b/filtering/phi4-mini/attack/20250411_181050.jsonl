{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The first thing I notice is the use of certutil.exe with the -encode and -decode commands. That's a red flag because certutil is often used for encoding and decoding files, but in the context of malware, it can be used to execute malicious code. For example, the command line shows encoding calc.exe into a temporary file and then decoding it back, which might be a way to obfuscate the malicious payload.\n\nThen there's the process creation of rundll32.exe with PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask. That doesn't look right. PcaPatchSdbTask isn't a standard component, and using rundll32 with DLLs can be a method to execute code without proper binaries, which is common in malware.\n\nLooking at the files created in the Temp directory, like 'modulo_logico_calc_decoded.exe', these are temporary files that might be part of a larger attack. The fact that certutil is creating and decoding these files suggests data exfiltration or execution of malicious code.\n\nAlso, there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe, which are frequently used in attack chains. The registry value sets could indicate attempts to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, there are also normal processes like chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe, which might be part of legitimate activities. But the combination of certutil usage, suspicious DLLs, and the creation of temporary executable files in Temp directories points towards a potential security threat. The presence of multiple certutil events and the specific command lines used are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Even though some entries are normal, the overall pattern here is concerning enough to warrant an investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil.exe used for encoding\/decoding files (potential payload obfuscation), rundll32.exe executing non-standard DLL functions (PcaPatchSdbTask), temporary files created in AppData\/Local\/Temp (common in malware), and repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe process access\/registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181050.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this batch of events. So, the user wants to know if this is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking at the events.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe with network connections. That's common, maybe normal browsing. But then there's a powershell.exe creating a file called 'componente_auxiliar.txt' in the Downloads folder. That's a red flag. PowerShell is often used for malicious activities, and creating a file in a user's Downloads might be part of an attack.\n\nNext, there are several registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or other malicious activities. However, chrome.exe might do some registry changes for its own purposes, so not sure yet.\n\nThen, winlogbeat.exe creates a file in its own directory. That seems normal, as winlogbeat is a log shipper and might create configuration files. But the file name has a .new extension, which could indicate it's a temporary file or part of an update. Maybe not suspicious.\n\nThere are also process accessed events by powershell.exe. Accessing processes could be part of reconnaissance or trying to manipulate other processes. \n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the powershell.exe creating a file in the Downloads folder and the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe. However, chrome.exe's registry changes might be benign. But the combination of powershell activities and the file creation might indicate something. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity like downloading payloads, executing scripts, or other signs, maybe it's not a high-confidence alert. However, the presence of these events could still be worth investigating further. So, I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and powershell.exe activity with file creation in user directories may indicate potential malicious behavior, though not definitively confirmed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
