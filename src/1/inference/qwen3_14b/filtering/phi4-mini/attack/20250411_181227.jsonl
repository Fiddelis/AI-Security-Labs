{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze them all together and decide if they're interesting for investigation.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, they all involve PowerShell commands that are creating scheduled tasks. The command lines are similar, using New-ScheduledTaskAction to execute calc.exe, triggers at logon, and setting the principal to Administrators with high run level. That seems suspicious because creating scheduled tasks with admin privileges could be a way to maintain persistence. Also, using calc.exe is a common technique in malicious scripts to test if the task works, but it's not harmful itself. However, the repetition of these commands multiple times might indicate an attempt to create multiple tasks, which could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen there are other events with \"Registry value set\" and \"Process accessed\" tasks. These could be part of the malware's behavior, trying to modify the registry or access processes. The \"Image loaded\" events point to .NET DLLs being loaded, which might be related to the PowerShell script's execution, as PowerShell often uses .NET components.\n\nBut wait, not all events are about PowerShell. There's one entry with chrome.exe, but that's just a registry value set, which might not be directly related unless there's more context. However, the majority of the events are about PowerShell creating scheduled tasks with admin rights, which is a red flag. Typically, legitimate tasks might not require such high privileges or might not be created so frequently.\n\nThe key here is the pattern of creating multiple scheduled tasks with admin privileges using PowerShell. This is a common technique in malware to ensure persistence on the system. Even though calc.exe is a harmless application, the method used here is indicative of malicious activity. The repetition of similar commands across multiple events increases the suspicion. Also, the use of the -RunLevel Highest parameter means the task runs with the highest privileges, which is unusual for normal user tasks.\n\nThe other events, like registry changes and image loads, could be part of the same malicious process. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But the combination of these elements—multiple scheduled tasks with admin rights, PowerShell usage, and possibly .NET components—points towards an attempt to compromise the system.\n\nTherefore, classifying this as INTERESTING makes sense because the events collectively suggest a potential security threat. The confidence would be high because the pattern is consistent with known attack techniques.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with elevated privileges (RunLevel Highest) targeting Administrators group, executing calc.exe. This pattern is indicative of malicious persistence mechanisms often seen in cyberattacks.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event stands out because it's a PowerShell command that's creating a scheduled task. The command line shows they're using New-ScheduledTaskAction with calc.exe, which is a common payload for testing, but in this context, it's suspicious. The trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is set to Administrators with high privileges. That's a red flag because creating a scheduled task for administrators with such settings could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.\n\nThen there's an entry about WmiPrvSE.exe loading taskschd.dll. That's part of the Windows Task Scheduler, so maybe related to the scheduled task creation. But why is that a concern? Well, if an attacker is using WMI to execute tasks, that could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nThe next few entries are about svchost.exe setting registry values. That's normal for system processes, but multiple registry changes might indicate configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere's a file created at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\unidade_comum. That path is part of the Task Scheduler directory, so creating a new task there aligns with the first event. The name \"unidade_comum\" might be a placeholder or a specific identifier, but it's not obviously malicious on its own.\n\nOther events involve Chrome and PowerShell creating files, like entrada_principal.txt and objeto_auxiliar.txt. These could be benign, but combined with the scheduled task creation, they might be part of a larger attack. However, Chrome's registry changes are common and not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating files is about the log collector, which is normal if they're configuring it. But the repeated registry changes and the scheduled task creation are more concerning.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious activity is the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges. That's a high-risk action that could be part of an attack. Even though other events might be normal, the combination of creating a scheduled task and the associated process activities makes this batch interesting for investigation. The confidence is around 0.75 because while the scheduled task is a clear indicator, other events are not definitively malicious without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A PowerShell process is creating a scheduled task with elevated privileges (Administrators group, RunLevel Highest) to execute calc.exe at logon, which is suspicious for persistence or privilege escalation.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a powershell.exe process loading an image from the Windows Defender path, MpOAV.dll. Then, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 extension, which is a PowerShell script. Immediately after, that same file is deleted. Then there's a pipe created event, but no file involved there. \n\nNext, there's a command line from powershell.exe that's creating a scheduled task. The command line shows creating a scheduled task that runs calc.exe at logon, with the Administrators group having highest privileges. That seems suspicious because using Scheduled Tasks with high privileges could be a way to maintain persistence or execute commands with elevated rights. The fact that it's using the Administrators group and setting RunLevel to Highest is a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. But since they're all from chrome.exe and the task is \"Registry value set,\" maybe that's normal behavior? Unless there's something specific about the registry keys being modified. However, without more details, it's hard to tell. But since there are multiple entries, maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nThen there's a bunch of events where the process is \"None\" and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command.\" That's a lot of them. If the process is None, maybe it's a log source issue or the event doesn't have a process associated. But the task being \"Execute a Remote Command\" could indicate something like a remote code execution attempt. However, if there are 15 entries like that, maybe they're false positives or part of a normal system process. But the repetition might be concerning.\n\nPutting it all together: the PowerShell activity involving creating a scheduled task with high privileges is suspicious. The creation and deletion of a temporary script might be part of an attack, like executing a script and then cleaning up. The multiple \"Execute a Remote Command\" events could be part of a larger attack or just noise. However, the scheduled task creation seems more indicative of malicious activity. The Chrome registry changes might be benign, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe confidence here would be medium to high because the scheduled task with elevated privileges is a clear indicator. However, the other events might not be as relevant. So, the batch is interesting because of the PowerShell activity and the scheduled task setup.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell activity detected, including creation of a scheduled task with elevated privileges (run as Administrators with Highest RunLevel) and temporary script file creation\/deletion. Multiple 'Execute a Remote Command' events also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
