{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and powershell.exe with network connections and process access. But then there's a whoami.exe execution, which is a common command for checking user privileges. That might be benign, but combined with other activities, it could be suspicious.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe process that runs csc.exe (the C# compiler) with some temp files. The command line includes compiling a .cs file into an executable in the Temp directory. That's a bit unusual because compiling code on the fly might be part of a malicious payload. Also, the generated files like pacote_padrao.exe and registro_ativo.exe are in the Temp folder, which is a common place for malware to hide.\n\nThen there's an entry where csc.exe creates a file named unidade_padrao.exe in the Temp directory. The next event shows the execution of registro_temporario.exe, which might be the compiled malicious code. The ImageLoad events for estrutura_ativo.exe and modulo_secundario.exe loading from Temp and System32 might indicate that the malware is trying to inject code or use legitimate processes to avoid detection.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple RegistryEvent entries could suggest attempts to modify system settings or persistence mechanisms. The termination of elemento_ativo.exe might be the malware cleaning up after itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of compiling code in memory, creating temporary executables, and loading suspicious images points towards a potential malicious activity. Even though some processes like chrome.exe and powershell.exe are common, the specific sequence of events involving code compilation and execution from Temp directories is concerning. The confidence is high because these are typical indicators of a malware infection or a cyber attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: compilation of custom code in temp directories (csc.exe), execution of unknown executables (unidade_logico.exe, estrutura_ativo.exe), and potential code injection (ImageLoad of modulo_secundario.exe from System32). Combined with registry modifications and process access attempts, this suggests potential malware activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180641.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The options are either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event to see what's happening. The first entry is about Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows DLL, part of the URL Moniker, so that's normal. Maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's svchost.exe setting a registry value. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, so that's normal too. Registry changes by svchost might be part of regular system operations, but I need to check if there's anything unusual.\n\nNext, winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file in its data directory seems normal. The path mentions .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be a temporary file during configuration setup. Not suspicious yet.\n\nThen, ApplicationFrameHost.exe setting a registry value. That process is related to Windows UI, so maybe part of normal operations. Calculator.exe again setting registry valuesâ€”still, Calculator is a standard app, so maybe user interaction.\n\nPowerShell.exe being accessed. PowerShell is a common tool, but \"Process accessed\" might indicate someone is interacting with it. However, without more context, like if it's running suspicious commands, it's hard to tell. But just being accessed might not be enough.\n\nThen there's a bunch of chrome.exe entries, all setting registry values. Chrome is a common browser, so registry changes could be part of updates or normal operation. However, multiple entries might be a red flag, but if they're all legitimate, maybe not. Also, one of them loads amsi.dll, which is part of Windows Defender's Anti-Malware Scan Interface. That's a legitimate DLL, so that's normal.\n\nLooking at the entire batch, most events seem to be routine system and application activities. The only thing that stands out a bit is the multiple registry changes by chrome.exe, but since Chrome is a common application, that might be expected. The winlogbeat file creation is also normal. The Calculator and svchost activities don't seem suspicious. The PowerShell access is a bit more concerning, but without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, the confidence here is low because there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. All the processes involved are legitimate, and the events don't show any anomalies like unexpected file paths, unusual registry changes, or signs of exploitation. Therefore, the batch might not be interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (Calculator, svchost, chrome, winlogbeat) performing normal operations (registry changes, file creation, DLL loading). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
