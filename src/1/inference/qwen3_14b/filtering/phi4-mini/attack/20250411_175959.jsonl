{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are about chrome.exe making network connections. That's normal, right? Browsers connect to the internet all the time. But there are several entries for powershell.exe. Now, PowerShell is a common tool, but when it's doing certain actions, that might be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events, there's one where the command line includes a bunch of commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey.exe \/list, and listing directories in C:\\Users. That seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users and groups. Also, there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_dlzxt2rm.x5w.ps1, and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script file could be part of an attack, maybe executing a script and then cleaning up traces.\n\nAnother thing is the image loaded events for PowerShell. It's loading clr.dll and mscor√©e.dll, which are part of the .NET framework. That might be normal, but combined with the other activities, it could indicate something more. The registry value set events might be related to changing settings, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe Provider Lifecycle events are probably just the PowerShell provider initializing, but the repeated entries might be part of a script that's running multiple commands. The fact that the same command line is repeated several times could indicate a script that's being executed in a loop or multiple times.\n\nPutting this all together: normal browser activity is expected, but the PowerShell activities include information gathering, temporary file creation and deletion, and loading of .NET components. These actions are often seen in malicious activities, like reconnaissance or establishing persistence. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious code execution or data exfiltration, it's a bit ambiguous. But the combination of these events does raise some red flags. The confidence isn't 100% because it could be a legitimate script, but the presence of multiple suspicious actions makes it worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell activities detected, including user\/group enumeration, temporary script file creation\/deletion, and loading of .NET components, which may indicate reconnaissance or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user wants me to analyze all the events together and determine if there's something suspicious going on.\n\nLooking at the first event, there's a process called winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But maybe the path is in the Downloads folder, which could be a red flag if it's not expected. However, I need to check other events for more context.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe command that runs several commands like net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember, cmdkey \/list, ls C:\\Users, get-childitem, dir, get-localgroup, and net localgroup. This seems like someone is trying to gather information about the system's users, groups, and possibly stored credentials. The use of cmdkey \/list could be looking for stored passwords, which is suspicious. Also, the command is using PowerShell, which is common but can be abused for malicious purposes.\n\nThen there are multiple events where net.exe is run with user and localgroup commands. That's part of the same information-gathering activity. The powershell.exe events with ProcessAccess might indicate that the process is being monitored or accessed, which could be normal or part of an attack.\n\nAnother event shows a file created named pacote_ativo.txt. The name is in Portuguese, which might be a red herring, but the fact that a file is created here could be part of data exfiltration or storing information. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThere are several chrome.exe events with Registry value set. That might be related to Chrome's normal operations, but if there's a lot of registry changes, it could be something else. However, since there are multiple entries, maybe it's just normal activity.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll and combase.dll are part of standard Windows components, so that's probably not suspicious. The SDXHelper.exe loading combase.dll might be normal too, but I'm not sure. The updater.exe from Google seems legitimate, but the command line is quite long and includes parameters that might be normal for an updater.\n\nThe Security Group Management tasks with no process might be related to group policy or user management, but without more info, it's hard to tell. The repeated entries might be normal or could be part of an attack.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious parts are the PowerShell command that's gathering system information, including users, groups, and stored credentials. Creating a file in the Downloads directory and the multiple registry changes might be part of an attack. However, some of these activities could be normal, like updating software or configuring logs. The confidence is medium because while there are suspicious activities, they might not be conclusive on their own. But combined, they could indicate reconnaissance or preparation for a more serious attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell command gathering system information (users, groups, credentials), creation of a potential configuration file in a downloads directory, and repeated registry modifications by chrome.exe. These could indicate reconnaissance or initial compromise phases.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_175959.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: net1.exe is running with the command line 'net1 localgroup'. Wait, the command line is 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1 localgroup'. Hmm, the 'net1' command isn't a standard Windows command. The usual 'net' command is used for network-related tasks, but 'net1' doesn't ring a bell. That might be a typo or a renamed malicious executable. Also, the process is created under the Process Create rule, which is normal, but the executable name is unusual.\n\nNext, there's a powershell.exe creating a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's part of PowerShell's normal operations, but creating files in user-specific directories isn't necessarily bad. However, the path seems legitimate, so maybe not suspicious here.\n\nThen, conhost.exe has a registry value set. Conhost is a standard Windows process related to console windows, so that's probably normal. No red flags here.\n\nWinlogbeat.exe is creating a file in the downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal during setup. But the same file is mentioned twice, which might be redundant, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creates a file called modulo_base.txt. That's a generic name, could be anything. No obvious signs of malicious activity here.\n\nMicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe is running with a command line that includes \/ua \/installsource scheduler. That seems like a legitimate update process, possibly triggered by the scheduler. The image loaded is taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. That's normal for an update process.\n\nSvchost.exe has a registry value set. Svchost is a standard host process for Windows services, so this is normal.\n\nAnother instance of winlogbeat.exe creating the same .yml.new file again. Maybe a repetition, but not suspicious.\n\nFinally, powershell.exe has a process accessed and registry value set. Again, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting it all together, the most suspicious part is the first event with net1.exe. The name is unusual, and the command line doesn't match standard commands. However, the other events don't show clear signs of malicious activity. Since there's only one potentially suspicious event, but not enough to confirm a breach, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence. However, if the presence of net1.exe is considered a red flag, it might be \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. But since there's no other events pointing to a larger attack, maybe it's better to flag it as not interesting but with a note. However, the user wants a single classification. Considering that only one event is odd, but not enough to confirm, the confidence is low. So the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"No clear indicators of malicious activity. The only unusual event involves 'net1.exe' (non-standard command), but it's isolated and lacks context (no suspicious file creation, network activity, or privilege escalation). Other events involve legitimate processes (PowerShell, EdgeUpdate, winlogbeat) and standard system operations.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
