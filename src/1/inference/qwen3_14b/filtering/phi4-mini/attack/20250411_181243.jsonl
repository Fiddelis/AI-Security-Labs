So, looking at the JSONL entries, they're all related to PowerShell.exe and some other processes like whoami.exe. \n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries with the task 'Process Create' for PowerShell.exe. The command line in one of them is a long string that includes commands like 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey.exe \/list', 'ls C:\/Users', 'get-childitem', 'dir', 'get-localgroup', and 'net localgroup'. These commands seem to be gathering system information, like user details, group memberships, and listing files in the Users directory. That's suspicious because such commands could be part of an attack to enumerate the system.\n\nThen there's a 'File created' event for a temporary script file, which is then deleted. The file path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for malware to store temporary files. The creation and immediate deletion might be an attempt to hide the script's presence, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events, which might indicate some kind of automated tool or script running. The repeated entries could be part of a larger attack or reconnaissance phase.\n\nThe 'Image loaded' events mention loading DLLs like mscoree.dll and mscorlib.ni.dll. These are related to the .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, but if there's an unusual number of such events or unexpected DLLs, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the DLLs mentioned are standard.\n\nAnother point is the use of 'whoami.exe', which is a legitimate tool to check the current user, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands gathering system info, creating and deleting a temp script, and the multiple process and image load events could indicate a malicious actor trying to gather information about the system. This is likely part of an initial reconnaissance phase in an attack. Therefore, this batch is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands to gather system information (net user, get-localuser, ls C:\/Users), creating and immediately deleting a temporary script file in the Temp directory, and loading .NET-related DLLs, indicating potential reconnaissance or malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a list of system events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look for any patterns or suspicious activities. The first event is 'net.exe' running with the command 'user', which is a legitimate Windows command for managing users. But then there's a 'net1.exe' with similar commands. Wait, 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows executable. That's a red flag. Maybe a typo or a malicious file disguised as a legitimate one.\n\nNext, there's a PowerShell process executing a series of commands: 'net user', 'get-localuser', 'get-localgroupmember', 'cmdkey \/list', and listing user directories. This seems like information-gathering activity, which could be part of reconnaissance by an attacker. The use of multiple commands to enumerate users, groups, and stored credentials might indicate someone trying to map the system's user structure.\n\nThen, there's a 'cmdkey.exe \/list' command. Cmdkey is used to manage stored credentials, so listing them could be an attempt to extract sensitive information. The fact that this is being run via PowerShell might be part of a script that's collecting credentials.\n\nLooking at the files created, there's a '.winlogbeat.yml.new' file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, but if this file is being created in the user's Downloads directory, it might be part of an installation or configuration. However, if it's unexpected, it could be a sign of something else. Also, a 'elemento_logico.txt' file is created, which is a bit vague. The name doesn't indicate anything obviously malicious, but the context matters.\n\nThe repeated use of PowerShell with 'Process accessed' and 'Registry value set' events might indicate that the attacker is modifying registry settings to persist access or alter system behavior. The 'Registry value set' events could be part of that persistence mechanism.\n\nThere's also a 'calc.exe' process loading 'urlmon.dll', which is a normal system file. However, if this is part of a larger pattern, like injecting code into a legitimate process, it could be suspicious. But on its own, it's not necessarily a problem.\n\nThe presence of 'notepad.exe' and 'svchost.exe' with registry changes might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a broader attack. However, the key points here are the non-standard 'net1.exe', the PowerShell commands gathering system information, and the possible credential enumeration via cmdkey.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of using a suspicious executable, information-gathering commands, and potential credential extraction suggests that this might be a malicious activity. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the overall pattern points towards something that needs further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: non-standard executable 'net1.exe' (likely a typo\/malicious variant of 'net.exe'), PowerShell executing user enumeration commands (net user, get-localuser), credential listing via cmdkey.exe \/list, and file creation in user directories that may indicate data exfiltration or persistence attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181243.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst event: Calculator.exe loaded urlmon.dll. Wait, Calculator is a legitimate process, but urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so that's normal. Maybe a false positive? But the ImageLoad event could be normal.\n\nSecond event: whoami.exe was created. Whoami is a standard tool for checking user context. The command line looks legitimate. ProcessCreate is a normal event. Not suspicious here.\n\nThird event: PowerShell.exe accessed. PowerShell is common, but the ProcessAccess rule might indicate someone trying to interact with it. But without more info, like if it's being used for something malicious, it's hard to tell. Maybe just a normal access.\n\nCombined, these events don't show a clear attack chain. No unusual process names, no unexpected file paths. All processes are legitimate. Maybe the user is just running normal tools. No signs of privilege escalation or data exfiltration. So probably not interesting. Confidence around 0.3, as there's no obvious threat, but maybe the PowerShell access could be a red flag. However, without more context, it's not enough to classify as interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate system processes (Calculator.exe, whoami.exe, PowerShell.exe) with no suspicious file paths or anomalous behavior detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
