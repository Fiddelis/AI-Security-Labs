Multiple ProcessAccess events, ImageLoad events loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET, so that's normal. But then there's a command line from powershell.exe that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. The binary path points to a file in C:\\unidade_logico\\... which seems like a non-standard location. That's a red flag because creating a service from a non-system directory is often a sign of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there's a FileCreate and then immediate FileDelete event for a temporary script file. That could be part of a script that's being executed and then cleaned up, which is common in attacks to avoid leaving traces. The Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which isn't inherently bad but in combination with other events could indicate something malicious.\n\nThe services.exe entries modifying the registry multiple times might be related to the new service created by PowerShell.

The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries involving svchost.exe creating files in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory. That's a common location for Windows Update files, so maybe that's normal. But then there are a bunch of registry value set events from svchost.exe. While svchost.exe is a legitimate process, having multiple registry changes might be suspicious, especially if they're not part of a known update or configuration.\n\nThen there's MpSigStub.exe, which is related to Windows Defender. It's creating files in the Temp directory, which could be part of a legitimate update process. However, the filenames like \"mpasdlta.vdm\" and \"mpavdlta.vdm\" might be part of signature updates. But I should check if these are standard files. Also, there's a setup.exe creating files in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. That seems normal for installing Edge components, but the presence of files like ie_to_edge_stub.exe and elevated_tracing_service.exe might be part of a legitimate installation. However, I need to consider if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nLooking at the WindowsUpdate.etl file, that's a common log file for Windows Update. The other files in SoftwareDistribution\\Download might be part of an update, but the repeated registry changes by svchost.exe could indicate something more. If these registry changes are not part of a known update or service, that might be a red flag. Also, the fact that there are multiple FileCreate events from svchost.exe in different locations might be normal, but combined with the registry events, it's worth investigating further.\n\nI should also check for any anomalies in the file paths. The Temp directory files are temporary, so that's expected. But the combination of these events might suggest that the system is undergoing an update or installation, which is normal. However, if these events are occurring in a short time frame or are part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, that could be a concern. But based solely on the provided logs, it seems like a mix of legitimate Windows Update and Defender activities.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these logs to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, there are several entries related to PowerShell.exe. The first few entries show 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. The fourth entry has a command line that's a bit suspicious. It's importing a module from a path that looks odd: 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The '..' in the path might indicate moving up a directory, which could be a red flag. Also, the command line includes 'Invoke-entrada_principal' which might be a typo or a custom script name. That seems unusual.\n\nThen there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell.exe with paths like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and urlmon.dll. These are all legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But the fact that PowerShell is loading these might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nThere's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory. The file name is a random string, which could be part of normal operations, but the creation and deletion might be part of a script trying to hide its tracks. However, since it's in the Temp folder, it's common for temporary files to be created and deleted.\n\nOther processes like svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, HxTsr.exe, and sppsvc.exe have events related to file creation and registry changes. Some of these are normal system processes. For example, svchost.exe creating files in SoftwareDistribution might be related to Windows Update. The registry events might be part of normal operations, but multiple registry changes from different processes could be a sign of something.\n\nThe key suspicious point is the PowerShell command line with the unusual path and the use of '..' which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual path. Also, the presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the creation of a temporary file that's quickly deleted might indicate malicious activity. However, without more context, like the actual content of the script or other indicators, it's a bit tricky.\n\nConsidering all this, the logs do show some potentially suspicious activities, especially the PowerShell command line with the odd path. But I'm not 100% sure if it's malicious. The confidence might be around 0.7. So the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" because there are signs that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe process creations with suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., importing a module from a non-standard path with '..' directory traversal) and temporary file creation\/deletion patterns that may indicate obfuscation or cleanup activities.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple files being created in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download directory under Metadata. The files are UpdateAgent.dll, Mitigation.dll, UAOneSettings.dll, etc. These names seem like they could be part of a Windows Update process, but I should check if they're legitimate. The process creating them is svchost.exe, which is a common system process, but sometimes malware uses it as a host.\n\nNext, there are entries about image loads, like urlmon.dll and BitsProxy.dll. These are legitimate system files, so that might not be suspicious. However, the fact that svchost.exe is loading them is normal, but I need to see if there's anything unusual here.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events. The process is still svchost.exe, but the file is listed as None. That might be normal for registry events, but multiple registry changes could be a sign of something, though not necessarily malicious.\n\nLooking at the file paths, most of the created files are in SoftwareDistribution, which is part of Windows Update. The presence of multiple .dll files in the Metadata folder might be part of an update package. However, the fact that so many files are being created in that directory could be a red flag. Also, the filename \"edbtmp.log\" appearing twice in the DataStore\\Logs directory might be normal during update operations, but again, the quantity might be worth checking.\n\nWait, but the SoftwareDistribution folder is typically used by Windows Update, so creating files there is normal. However, the presence of multiple .dll files in the Metadata subdirectory might be part of the update process. However, if these files are being created by svchost.exe, which is a legitimate process, it might not be malicious. But I should consider if there's any known malware that uses these filenames.\n\nAnother point is the timestamp in the filename: waasmedic.20250606_143612_048.etl. The date here is 2025, which is in the future. That's definitely a red flag. The system date is 2025, but if the current date is, say, 2023, that's a clear anomaly. This could indicate a timestamp manipulation or a log file generated in the future, which is suspicious. However, I need to check if the user provided the correct date. But since the logs show that date, it's a problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple registry value set events without any file paths might be normal, but combined with the future timestamp, it could be a sign of tampering. However, I need to confirm if the timestamp is a mistake or a real event.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of files in the SoftwareDistribution directory is normal, but the future timestamp in the log file name is highly suspicious. svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but if it's creating files with future timestamps, that might indicate a problem. Also, the multiple registry changes could be part of a normal update process, but combined with the timestamp issue, it's worth investigating. Therefore, this batch is interesting because of the future timestamp in the log file, which is a clear indicator of potential tampering or a log injection attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple files created in Windows Update directories (SoftwareDistribution) by svchost.exe, including suspicious DLLs in Metadata subdirectory.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first few entries show the 'tarefa_logico.exe' process loading various DLLs from standard Windows directories like System32 and the .NET Framework folder. That seems normal, as those are legitimate system files. But then I notice entries where PowerShell is creating a file in the user's AppData directory, which isn't necessarily bad, but could be part of a script's setup.\n\nThen there's a part where a process with no name (maybe a service or a scheduled task) is executing a remote command, loading a PowerShell script from 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The path here is a bit suspicious because 'unidade_logico' might be a custom directory, not a standard system path. Also, the script is being imported and executed with commands like Invoke-entrada_principal, which isn't a standard PowerShell cmdlet. That could be a custom function, possibly part of malicious activity.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of the same PowerShell command line being executed, which includes importing the same module and trying to start a service called 'objeto_ativo' with a binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe' in another custom directory. Creating a new service and starting it could be a sign of persistence, which is a common tactic in malware. The repeated entries might indicate that the script is being run multiple times, perhaps to ensure it's executed even if the initial attempt fails.\n\nAlso, the use of 'Start-Sleep 5' in the command line suggests the script is pausing, which might be to avoid detection or to wait for other processes. The fact that the same command is logged multiple times could mean the attacker is trying to make sure their payload runs successfully.\n\nPutting this all together: the initial loading of legitimate DLLs might be a distraction, but the subsequent PowerShell activities, especially the creation of a new service and the use of non-standard paths and scripts, point towards a potential security threat. The combination of these events is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands execute a custom module from non-standard paths, create a new service with a suspicious executable, and repeatedly invoke potentially malicious scripts.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, there are a bunch of JSON entries here, all with the same structure. Each one has a \"process\" field set to \"None\", a \"winlog\" field that's a stringified dictionary, and a \"file\" field that's also a stringified dict with a path.\n\nLooking at the \"winlog\" task, most of them are 'Execute a Remote Command', which immediately raises a red flag. That's a common indicator of malicious activity, especially if it's repeated multiple times. The file path mentioned is 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The fact that the same PowerShell script is being executed repeatedly in the same location suggests something is wrong. \n\nNow, there's one entry where the winlog task is 'Windows Update Agent' and the file is None. That might be a legitimate process, but since the rest are all the same, it's probably noise or maybe a false positive. However, the majority of the events are the same, which is concerning. \n\nBut wait, the user said to analyze the entire batch as a whole. So even though there's one different entry, the rest are all the same. The repetition of the same command and file path points to a potential attack, like a script being executed multiple times, possibly for persistence or data exfiltration. The confidence here is high because the same event happening so many times is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Even if one is legitimate, the sheer number of identical events is suspicious. \n\nI should check if the file path is a known good one. But since I don't have that context, the repetition alone is enough to flag it. So the classification should be INTERESTING with high confidence. The justification is the repeated execution of the same remote command from the same file, which is a common attack pattern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple repeated events show the same PowerShell script being executed remotely from a non-standard path, indicating potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}

So first, looking at the events. There are multiple entries here. The first few entries are about processes using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. Then they start that service. The winlog tasks here are \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". \n\nThen there are several entries where the process is None, and the winlog task is \"Execute a Remote Command\", with the file path pointing to componente_auxiliar.ps1. That seems suspicious because executing a remote command could be part of an attack. Also, the fact that the same PowerShell command is repeated multiple times might indicate an automated process or a script that's being run repeatedly.\n\nThe service creation is also a red flag. Creating a new service with a custom executable could be a way to install malware. The binary path is in a directory that seems non-standard, like \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\...\" which might be a custom or hidden directory. Also, the service name \"objeto_ativo\" doesn't look like a standard Windows service name. \n\nThe repeated execution of the same command, both for creating the service and running the remote script, suggests that there might be an ongoing attempt to compromise the system. The combination of creating a service, executing remote commands, and using PowerShell (which is often used in attacks) points towards potential malicious activity. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign explanation. Maybe it's a legitimate software installation? But the use of \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the non-standard paths make me lean towards it being malicious. Also, the fact that multiple events are logged with the same command line might indicate that the process is being repeated, which is common in malware persistence mechanisms.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the batch is likely interesting for investigation. The confidence would be high, maybe around 0.9, because the combination of service creation, remote command execution, and the repetition of the same commands are strong indicators of potential malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands creating a suspicious service (objeto_ativo) with a non-standard binary path, followed by repeated execution of a remote script (componente_auxiliar.ps1).
