Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first entry: powershell.exe with a registry value set. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's creating a scheduled task with schtasks. The command line here is creating a task that runs powershell.exe with -ep bypass and a script path. The script name is \"NonExistingScript.ps1\". Wait, if the script doesn't exist, that might be a red flag. Maybe the attacker is trying to execute a non-existent script to bypass detection or as part of a multi-stage attack.\n\nNext, there's another powershell.exe process accessing a file, but the file isn't specified. Then schtasks.exe is creating another scheduled task with a similar command line, again referencing a non-existent script. The image load for taskschd.dll is normal, but the repeated registry changes by svchost.exe might be suspicious. However, svchost.exe is a common host process, so that could be normal too.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is creating a file in the System32 Tasks directory named \"win32times\". That seems like a scheduled task being created, which could be legitimate, but combined with the previous schtasks commands, it might be part of an attempt to set up persistence. The other entries about chrome.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files might be benign, like configuration files, but the repeated registry changes by chrome.exe are a bit odd. However, chrome.exe modifying registry values could be part of normal operations or extensions.\n\nThe key points here are the use of schtasks to create scheduled tasks that execute PowerShell scripts with -ep bypass, which is used to bypass execution policy restrictions. The non-existent script names might indicate that the attacker is trying to execute a script that's not present, possibly because it's being downloaded later or there's a typo. Also, the scheduled tasks are set to run daily under the system account, which is a sign of persistence and potential malicious activity.\n\nThe presence of multiple events related to creating scheduled tasks and modifying the registry, along with PowerShell being used with bypass switches, points towards potential malicious behavior. Even though some entries might be normal, the combination here is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. So, the classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence level around 0.75, as there are several indicators of compromise but not definitive proof without more context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: scheduled tasks created with schtasks.exe to execute PowerShell scripts using -ep bypass (common in attacks), non-existent script paths (possible obfuscation), and repeated registry modifications. These patterns suggest potential persistence mechanism setup or malicious execution attempts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180224.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first event shows that powershell.exe created a file at 'C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\entrada_ativo.txt'. The next two events involve powershell.exe and whoami.exe. The whoami.exe process was created, which is a normal command to get user information. Then there are two more ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe.\n\nHmm, creating a file isn't necessarily bad, but when combined with ProcessAccess events, it might indicate something. However, the other processes here are standard. The file path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for user files. There's no mention of any suspicious activity like downloading from the internet or executing malicious code. The events don't show any signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Since there's no clear malicious activity here, maybe this isn't interesting. But I should check if the combination of events could be part of a larger attack. Without more context, like network connections or other suspicious files, it's hard to tell. The confidence is low, so I'd classify this as not interesting.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show standard process activity (powershell.exe file creation and process access, whoami.exe execution) without indicators of compromise. No suspicious behavior or security-relevant patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.2\n}"}
