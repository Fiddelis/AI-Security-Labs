{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell creates a file in the Temp directory with a name that includes __PSScriptPolicyTest. That might be a normal script, but then the next event is the same file being deleted. That could be part of a legitimate process, but maybe not. Then there's a pipe created event, which might be normal too.\n\nLooking further, there's a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 with a log path in the TEMP directory. The name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" immediately raises a red flag. That script is commonly associated with keylogging malware. The fact that it's being executed via PowerShell and writing to a temporary file could be malicious.\n\nAnother event shows the same script being run again, but from a different path. Also, there's an entry where the process is None, but the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path points to Get-Keystrokes.ps1 again. That's suspicious because if the process is not logged, it might be an attempt to hide the source.\n\nOther events involve svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files, which might be normal operations. However, the repeated execution of Get-Keystrokes.ps1, especially from different paths and with different processes, suggests that this could be part of a malicious activity. The presence of this script multiple times, combined with the command-line arguments that indicate logging keystrokes, points towards potential malware. \n\nEven though some events are benign (like file creation by svchost or winlogbeat), the repeated and suspicious PowerShell commands with the keystroke script are significant. The classification here should be \"INTERESTING\" because the presence of known malicious scripts and the context of their execution indicate a potential security threat. The confidence is high, maybe around 0.9, because the evidence is clear and repeated.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve execution of 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' script with temporary log paths, a common indicator of keylogging malware.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, along with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking through the events. The first entry mentions a file created by powershell.exe at 'C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\objeto_temporario.txt'. That seems normal, but maybe not suspicious yet. Then there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. That might be normal behavior for Chrome, but repeated registry changes could be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there's an entry for whoami.exe, which is a standard command to get user information. That's probably legitimate. But then there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs a script called Get-Keystrokes.ps1, which is saving keystrokes to a log file in the TEMP directory. Wait, that's suspicious. Keystroke logging is a common technique used by malware to capture sensitive information like passwords. The script's path is in different directories each time, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the location. Also, the fact that it's being executed multiple times with similar commands could indicate an ongoing attempt to log keystrokes.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of ImageLoad events for PowerShell, including some .NET framework DLLs. That's normal for PowerShell, but when combined with the keystroke logging, it might be part of a larger malicious activity. The presence of the Get-Keystrokes.ps1 script is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Even though some of the other events might be benign, the combination of these PowerShell commands and the keystroke logging suggests a potential security threat.\n\nI should also check if the same script is being called from different paths. The command lines show variations in the directory paths, which could be an attempt to evade detection by changing the location each time. Additionally, the use of $env:TEMP to store the log file is a common tactic used by malware to hide files in temporary directories that are often overlooked.\n\nThe other events involving chrome.exe and registry changes might be unrelated, but the PowerShell activities are clearly pointing towards a possible attack. The confidence level would be higher because the keystroke logging is a clear sign of malicious behavior. Even though there's no direct mention of network activity or file downloads, the presence of the script alone is enough to flag this batch as interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts with -LogPath $env:TEMP\\\\key.log, indicating potential keystroke logging malware. The script's repeated execution from different paths (e.g., C:\\\\tarefa_base..., C:\\\\elemento_secundario...) suggests obfuscation techniques, while the TEMP directory log path is a common tactic for stealthy data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
