{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: there's conhost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, chrome.exe, and others. Most of these are common system processes, but I need to check their activities.\n\nThe first event mentions conhost.exe with a registry value set. That's normal for some operations, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's a powershell.exe command line that's compressing a directory into a zip file in the temp directory. The command line is using Compress-Archive, which is a legitimate PowerShell cmdlet. However, the path being compressed is \"C:\\\\unidade_ativo\\\\elemento_base\\\\elemento_temporario\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico\". The names here are a bit unusualâ€”maybe they're obfuscated or part of a specific setup. But compressing files isn't inherently malicious.\n\nNext, there are multiple entries for svchost.exe and chrome.exe with registry value sets. Those are common and usually not a problem. The winlogbeat.exe events show file creation in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files might be normal during setup. However, the file path is .winlogbeat.yml.new, which could be part of a configuration update, but I need to check if that's expected.\n\nAnother point is the event where chrome.exe loads MpOAV.dll from the Windows Defender directory. That's a legitimate DLL, so that's probably just part of the browser's interaction with the antivirus.\n\nNow, looking at the PowerShell events. There's a process accessed event, which might indicate someone is trying to manipulate the process. But without more context, like unauthorized access or unexpected parent processes, it's hard to tell. The command line for the first PowerShell event is about compressing a folder, which could be part of a legitimate backup or preparation for moving files, but maybe the source directory is something suspicious.\n\nHowever, I don't see any clear signs of malware, unauthorized access, or unusual network activity. The events seem to be a mix of normal system operations and configuration changes. The only slightly odd thing is the repeated registry value sets on chrome.exe and svchost.exe, but those could be part of normal operations or updates.\n\nWait, the command line in the second event uses a PowerShell script to compress a specific path. The path includes \"tarefa_logico\" which might be a Portuguese term for \"logical task\" or something similar. Not sure if that's relevant, but maybe the user is in a Portuguese-speaking environment. Still, compressing files isn't inherently bad.\n\nI don't see any events indicating privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a config file might be normal if the user is setting up log shipping. The other processes like notepad.exe and RuntimeBroker.exe are standard.\n\nConsidering all this, the batch doesn't show clear malicious activity. The events are mostly routine. However, the PowerShell compression command might be worth looking into if the source directory is unexpected or if there's a lack of user context. But without more data, it's hard to classify this as interesting. The confidence is moderate, maybe around 0.4, but since there's no clear threat, it's more likely \"NOT INTERESTING\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show routine system operations, common processes (e.g., powershell.exe, svchost.exe), and standard activities like file compression and registry modifications. No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180055.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Registry value set, Process accessed, Image loaded, File created, and File deleted. There's also a whoami.exe process, which is normal for checking user identity. But the key here is the frequency and the specific actions.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell activities: there are multiple instances of Process accessed and Registry value set. That's common in legitimate scripts, but when it's repeated a lot, it might be a red flag. Then there are Image loaded events pointing to .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are part of the .NET runtime, so loading them isn't inherently bad. However, if PowerShell is loading these, maybe it's executing .NET code, which could be part of a malicious payload.\n\nThen there's the File created and File deleted events. The files created are temporary scripts in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is common for legitimate processes too. But the fact that they're created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Also, the command lines show Compress-Archive commands being used multiple times. That's a PowerShell cmdlet, so it's normal, but if it's being used in a way that's not typical for the user or system, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nWait, the Compress-Archive commands are being run with paths that look like they're from different directories, maybe part of some automated process. However, the fact that there are multiple compressions happening in a short time could be part of an attack, like exfiltrating data. But I don't see any network activity here, so that's not directly indicated.\n\nAnother thing is the use of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module. The logs mention the module's script being loaded. That's a legitimate module, but if it's being used in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might be part of a more complex attack.\n\nAlso, there's a winlogbeat.exe process creating a file, which is part of the ELK stack for logging. That might be normal if the system is set up for monitoring, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it could be a sign that someone is trying to collect logs or data.\n\nBut I need to check if all these events are part of normal operations. For example, the whoami.exe is just checking the user, which is normal. The Image loaded events are standard for .NET apps. The File created and deleted might be part of temporary script execution. However, the high number of PowerShell events and the specific tasks could indicate that someone is using PowerShell for more than just routine tasks.\n\nThe key points are the repetition of certain events (like Process accessed, Registry value set), the loading of .NET DLLs, and the creation\/deletion of temporary files. These could be signs of a script-based attack, like a PowerShell-based payload that's modifying the registry, accessing processes, and creating temporary files to execute malicious code.\n\nHowever, without more context, like network connections or other unusual processes, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the combination of these events does raise some flags. The confidence might be around 0.7 to 0.8, as it's not definitive but suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe events with registry modifications, process access, and image loading of .NET DLLs (mscoree.dll, clr.dll) suggest potential malicious activity. Temporary script files are created and deleted, which is common in attack patterns.
