{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look through these events. The majority are normal processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, and MpDefenderCoreService.exe doing typical things like DNS queries and network connections. But then there are some suspicious entries.\n\nFirst, there's the cmd.exe process with a command line that adds a user to the domain with a password \"registro_temporario_pass123!\" and adds them to the Domain Admins group. That's a red flag because creating domain admin accounts is a clear sign of compromise. The command line also uses \"net user\" and \"net group\" which are often used in attacks to escalate privileges.\n\nThen there's another cmd.exe instance adding another user \"unidade_comum_Admin\" with a password \"unidade_temporario_pass123!\" to the domain. The use of \"net1.exe\" instead of \"net.exe\" is odd. Maybe that's a typo or a malicious replacement. Also, the paths and usernames are a bit generic, which might be part of a template attack.\n\nAnother event shows powershell.exe creating a file at \"C:\\\\Users\\\\fiddelis\\\\Downloads\\\\pacote_base.txt\". While file creation isn't always bad, the context here matters. If this is a legitimate download, it's okay, but combined with the other suspicious activities, it might be part of data exfiltration or configuration files for the attack.\n\nThe repeated use of \"net.exe\" and \"net1.exe\" to add users and groups to the Domain Admins group is highly suspicious. These commands are typically used by attackers to gain administrative access. Also, the presence of multiple \"Registry value set\" events might indicate changes to system settings to maintain persistence or disable security features.\n\nEven though some events are normal, the combination of these command-line activities and file creation points to a potential security breach. The confidence here is high because creating domain admin accounts is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The other events, while not necessarily malicious on their own, when combined with these actions, suggest an ongoing attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: domain admin account creation via 'net user' and 'net group' commands, use of 'net1.exe' (likely a typo\/malicious replacement), and file creation in user directories that could indicate data exfiltration or malicious configuration. These actions strongly suggest a potential compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_180952.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these three events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me start by breaking down each line.\n\nFirst event: winlogbeat.exe is creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\winlogbeat-8.15.1-windows-x86_64\\data\\.winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal during setup. But the path is in the Downloads folder, which sometimes is used for temporary files. However, I should check if this is part of a legitimate installation or if it's something suspicious.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe is setting a registry value. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, but registry changes can be part of both legitimate and malicious activities. Without more context, it's hard to tell, but combined with other events, it might be a red flag.\n\nThird event: powershell.exe is accessing a process. Process access can be normal, but if it's accessing processes that aren't expected, that could be a sign of something bad. However, again, more context is needed.\n\nNow, looking at the combination. Winlogbeat creating a config file, then PowerShell modifying the registry and accessing a process. Could this be part of a legitimate setup? Maybe, but the use of PowerShell for registry changes and process access might be part of a script that's configuring the system. However, the presence of multiple PowerShell events might be suspicious, especially if they're not part of a known good process. The first event's file path seems to be a temporary file, which is normal, but the combination of these three events might indicate someone trying to set up a backdoor or modify system settings. However, without more evidence like unexpected network activity, file deletions, or other anomalies, it's a bit hard to say. The confidence is moderate because there's not enough data to confirm malicious intent, but the combination of events is noteworthy enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities combined with file creation by winlogbeat.exe may indicate configuration changes or potential malicious activity, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
