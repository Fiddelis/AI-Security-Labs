The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is normal as it's a standard Windows utility.

This seems suspicious because it's scanning files for sensitive information. The command is repeated multiple times, which might indicate an automated search.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events pointing to .NET Framework DLLs and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading these DLLs isn't inherently bad, but combined with the PowerShell activity, it could be part of a larger script or malicious activity. \n\nThere's also a file created and then immediately deleted in the Temp directory. That's a common tactic used by malware to execute code temporarily without leaving traces. The Pipe Created event might be related to inter-process communication, which could be legitimate but is worth investigating.\n\nConsidering all these points: the repeated search for passwords, the temporary file creation and deletion, and the loading of specific DLLs, this batch of events does show signs of potential malicious behavior.

The first thing I notice is that there's a process called winlogbeat.exe creating a file named .winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that might be normal, but the file path is in the Downloads directory. Not sure yet if that's suspicious.\n\nThen there's notepad.exe and svchost.exe doing registry value sets. Those are common processes, so maybe not a big deal. The powershell.exe events are more interesting. There are several instances where powershell is running commands to find strings with 'pass' in various file types. The command lines look like they're searching for passwords in files. That's a red flag because it could indicate someone is trying to find credentials on the system.\n\nAlso, there's an event where powershell.exe creates a file in the AppData directory. That's a common place for temporary files, but combined with the search for passwords, it might be part of a larger attempt to extract sensitive information. The repeated registry value sets by chrome.exe and other processes might be normal, but the combination of these events with the powershell activities raises suspicion. \n\nI should check if the findstr and select-string commands are part of legitimate activities. However, searching for passwords in files is typically associated with malicious activities like credential harvesting. The presence of multiple powershell commands doing this, along with file creation and registry changes, suggests potential malicious behavior. \n\nThe confidence isn't 100% because some of these processes are common, but the combination of searching for passwords and creating files in user directories is concerning.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple entries about chrome.exe doing DNS queries. That's normal for a browser, so maybe not suspicious yet. Then there's an entry about winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal. But wait, the same file path is mentioned multiple times. Maybe that's just part of the setup, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nNext, chrome.exe loading a DLL from Windows Defender's directory. That seems legitimate because Defender's DLLs are part of the system. But then there are multiple registry value set events by chrome.exe. Changing registry values could be a red flag, especially if it's modifying keys related to security or system settings. However, chrome.exe might legitimately modify some registry entries for its own settings.\n\nThen there are several network connections detected by chrome.exe. Again, browsers usually have network activity, so that's expected. But the repetition of the same events might indicate something, but not sure yet.\n\nLooking further, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a standard command to get user info, so not inherently malicious. However, if it's being used in a context where it shouldn't be, like part of a larger attack chain, that could be a problem. But alone, it's not suspicious.\n\nThen, powershell.exe creating files named \"objeto_logico.txt\" and \"estrutura_ativo.txt\". Those filenames don't immediately stand out, but the fact that PowerShell is creating files could be normal. However, if there are other suspicious activities around these files, like downloading or executing scripts, that would be a concern. But in the logs provided, there's no mention of that.\n\nAnother point is the multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe. If it's changing multiple registry values, maybe it's trying to disable security features or modify browser settings. But without knowing the specific keys being changed, it's hard to say. The logs don't specify which registry keys, so that's a bit of a blind spot.\n\nThe presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file might be part of a configuration change. If the user is setting up or updating winlogbeat, that's normal. But if the file is being created in an unusual location or with unusual permissions, that could be a problem. However, the path given is in the Downloads directory, which is common for user-initiated downloads.\n\nAlso, there are multiple ProcessAccess events for powershell.exe. That could indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which might be part of a legitimate script or could be an indicator of compromise if unauthorized processes are accessing it.\n\nPutting it all together: there's a lot of activity from chrome.exe and PowerShell, which are common tools. The registry changes and file creations might be part of normal operations, but the repetition of certain events and the lack of clear malicious indicators make it hard to classify as definitely suspicious. However, the combination of multiple registry modifications and file creations by different processes could warrant further investigation. The confidence is moderate because while there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the patterns could be indicative of something more if there's additional context.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple registry modifications by chrome.exe and file creation events by winlogbeat.exe and powershell.exe in user directories may indicate potential configuration changes or data exfiltration attempts.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to figure out if they're interesting or not. So, first, I'll scan through each event to spot any suspicious patterns.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activities. The first entry has cmd.exe running schtasks to delete scheduled tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks isn't necessarily bad, but doing it with \/f (force) might be a red flag if it's unexpected. Then there's a schtasks.exe process deleting other tasks, which could be part of a cleanup, but maybe part of a malicious process trying to remove its own tasks.\n\nThen there's a WMIC.exe command deleting notepad.exe processes. That seems odd. Why would someone delete notepad.exe? Maybe it's part of a larger attack, like trying to remove other processes or as part of a persistence mechanism. Also, the image loaded events for WMIC.exe include urlmon.dll and amsi.dll, which are legitimate, but the MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender is a bit concerning. Maybe the attacker is trying to bypass defenses?\n\nThere's also a lot of registry events, like registry value sets. If an attacker is modifying registry keys, that could be for persistence or altering system behavior. The svchost.exe and conhost.exe processes accessing the registry might be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nThe repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with commands that delete processes and scheduled tasks might indicate an attempt to clean up after an attack or to remove logs. The use of redirection to nul 2>&1 suggests they're trying to suppress output, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple instances of process deletion, registry modifications, and use of utilities like schtasks and WMIC, which are often used in malicious activities. The combination of these events could indicate an attacker trying to manipulate system processes and remove traces of their activities. However, some of these actions could be legitimate, like scheduled task cleanup. But given the frequency and the specific commands used, the risk is higher. So, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.

The main thing here is to look for any patterns or suspicious activities that might indicate a security threat.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each entry. There are a lot of PowerShell.exe and cmd.exe processes. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. But I need to check what they're doing. \n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a lot of 'net user \/del' commands. Deleting user accounts isn't inherently bad, but doing it repeatedly or in a certain context might be suspicious. For example, if an attacker is trying to remove user accounts to cover their tracks or take over the system. Also, some of the commands have '\/domain' which suggests they're interacting with a domain, maybe trying to delete domain users.\n\nThere's also 'whoami.exe' being executed multiple times. That's usually just checking the current user, but if it's done frequently, maybe part of a script to gather information.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'conhost.exe' and 'net1.exe'. 'conhost.exe' is a legitimate Windows process, but if it's involved in registry changes, that might be unusual. 'net1.exe' isn't a standard Windows executable; that could be a typo or a malicious file impersonating a legitimate one. The presence of 'net1.exe' trying to delete users is concerning.\n\nRegistry value set events are happening a lot too. Changing registry settings can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. If combined with process creation of suspicious executables, this might indicate an attempt to maintain access or modify system configurations.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple instances of PowerShell and cmd executing commands to delete users, possibly on a domain, along with registry modifications and the use of a non-standard executable (net1.exe). This could be part of a larger attack, like lateral movement or privilege escalation. The repetition of these actions might indicate automated scripts or tools being used. \n\nHowever, I should consider if these actions could be legitimate. For example, an admin might be cleaning up test accounts. But the combination of multiple suspicious processes, the use of 'net1.exe', and the frequency of the events makes me lean towards this being a security incident.

So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of cmd.exe and powershell.exe activity. One of the cmd.exe commands is deleting a service called 'win32times' using 'sc delete'. That seems suspicious because deleting system services isn't normal behavior. Also, there's a file deletion event where a temporary file is being deleted, which might be part of cleaning up after some malicious activity.\n\nThen there's the use of 'whoami.exe', which is usually benign, but when combined with other commands, it could be part of privilege escalation. The repeated registry value changes and process accesses might indicate someone is trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. \n\nThe 'sc delete' command for 'win32times' is a red flag. That service isn't a standard Windows service, so deleting it might be an attempt to remove a backdoor or something similar. Also, the deletion of temporary files could be hiding evidence.\n\nThere are multiple instances of PowerShell being accessed and registry events, which could be part of a larger attack. The 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events might be noise, but combined with the other suspicious activities, they add up. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any obvious malicious activity.

That's common, but sometimes PowerShell is used for malicious activities. Let me check the command lines. The first entry has \"powershell.exe & {}\" which seems like a no-op, maybe testing or a benign command. But then there are multiple entries of Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted. \n\nWait, there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_im4a2j3l.opf.ps1. Then it's deleted. That could be part of a script execution, but why create and delete it? Maybe trying to hide evidence. Also, the Image loaded entries include mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are related to .NET. That's normal, but if there's unexpected loading, it could be a sign.\n\nThere's also a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which isn't necessarily bad, but in combination with other events might indicate something. The whoami.exe executions are normal, just checking user identity. But the repeated ProcessAccess events on powershell.exe might indicate someone is trying to access or monitor the process, which could be malicious.\n\nHowever, there's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's part of normal operations. But the presence of multiple PowerShell events with file creation and deletion, along with registry changes, might suggest some automated script or tool running. The classification here is tricky. \n\nOn one hand, the activities could be part of legitimate PowerShell usage, like scripting or testing. On the other hand, the creation and deletion of temporary files, along with registry changes and multiple process accesses, might be indicative of a malicious payload trying to execute without leaving traces.

Alright, first step is to go through each event and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe and whoami.exe being created. Whoami.exe is a legitimate Windows command that displays the current user's identity. But when it's used in certain contexts, especially if it's part of a larger attack, it could be suspicious. However, in this case, it's just running normally, so maybe not a big red flag.\n\nThen there are several instances of Process accessed events for PowerShell.exe. That might be normal if it's being used for legitimate tasks. However, if it's being accessed repeatedly, that could be a sign of something malicious, like a script being run. But without more context, like command-line arguments or unusual behavior, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, there's also some Image loaded events for urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer and is used for handling URLs. If it's being loaded by processes like Calculator.exe, that might be normal, but sometimes attackers can abuse this DLL for malicious purposes. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so that's probably okay.\n\nThere's a File created event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file created is in the Downloads directory. That might be part of a legitimate installation or configuration. But if the user didn't initiate this, it could be suspicious. However, the log doesn't show any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity here.\n\nRegistry value set events are happening for various processes. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're modifying critical keys or adding new entries, that's a concern. However, the logs don't specify what the registry values are, so it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the overall picture, there's a lot of normal system activity. Processes like svchost.exe, chrome.exe, notepad.exe are common. The repeated PowerShell accesses could be part of a script or automation. The presence of whoami.exe isn't necessarily bad. The ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll are in standard locations.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the batch is interesting.
