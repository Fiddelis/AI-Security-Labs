Not suspicious on its own. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is common, but the tasks here might indicate something. There's a 'Process Create' event with a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for passwords in files. That looks like someone is trying to find credentials in documents. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, there are multiple 'Image loaded' events for .NET DLLs and Windows Defender's MpOAV.dll. Loading .NET assemblies might be normal, but combined with the previous activity, it could be part of a larger attack. Then, a file is created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 script, which is a PowerShell script. The file is then deleted, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces. \n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events with the same command line might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times or there's a loop.

Let me go through each event one by one.\n\nFirst event: powershell.exe loaded MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That seems normal, as MpClient.dll is part of Defender. Maybe a legitimate process.\n\nSecond event: powershell.exe running a command with findstr and select-string looking for passwords in files. That's interesting. Searching for passwords in various file types could be part of a password scraping attempt. The command is using findstr with \/si to search for 'pass' in files, then using select-string with a pattern 'password'. This might be trying to find credentials.\n\nThird event: svchost.exe setting a registry value. Common for system processes, might be normal.\n\nFourth: Calculator.exe loading urlmon.dll. Urlmon is part of Windows, so that's normal.\n\nFifth: findstr.exe running with the same command as before. This is the same search for passwords. This could be a red flag if it's part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nOther events involve powershell.exe accessing processes, registry changes, and chrome.exe doing DNS queries and registry changes. A lot of registry events might be normal, but if there's a pattern, like multiple registry modifications by different processes, that could be suspicious.\n\nThe user is using powershell to search for passwords in files. If this is part of a legitimate activity, maybe the user is trying to find their own passwords, but more likely, this is a malicious actor trying to extract sensitive information. The fact that the same command is used multiple times with powershell and findstr could indicate automated scanning for credentials.\n\nAlso, the presence of multiple registry events might be related to persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the main suspicious part here is the repeated use of findstr and select-string to search for passwords in various file types, which is a common technique in malware to gather sensitive data.\n\nSo putting it all together, the batch has events that include searching for passwords in files using command-line tools, which is a potential indicator of malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to analyze this batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with the first event: conhost.exe with a registry value set. Conhost is usually a legitimate process, part of Windows, used for hosting console windows. But registry changes can be suspicious if they're not normal. However, just one event might not be enough.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run. That's a standard command to get the current user, so that's normal. But then there's powershell.exe appearing multiple times with Process accessed and Registry value set events. PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The fact that it's being accessed multiple times and modifying the registry could be a red flag. But again, need more context.\n\nThen there's WMIC.exe with a command to delete a process named notepad.exe. That seems odd. Deleting a process isn't typical. Also, the image loaded events point to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, so loading that might be normal, but maybe in an unexpected context. However, the command line for WMIC is deleting a process, which could be part of a malicious action, like trying to remove a legitimate process to avoid detection.\n\nLooking further, there's a cmd.exe command to delete a user named \"tarefa_auxiliar_Admin\". Deleting a user is a significant action. Also, there's a net.exe and net1.exe (which might be a typo, perhaps net.exe?) trying to delete other users. That's definitely suspicious. User deletion is a high-privilege action that shouldn't be happening without proper authorization.\n\nThen, multiple entries of powershell.exe and cmd.exe modifying the registry. Combined with the user deletions, this could indicate someone trying to modify system settings or remove traces of their activity. The use of both PowerShell and CMD for these tasks might be part of a script or manual effort to compromise the system.\n\nAlso, the presence of WMIC.exe with a delete command, and the image loads from Defender's DLLs might be an attempt to bypass security software. However, the exact context is unclear. Are these processes being used legitimately, or is there an attack here?\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high-privilege actions (user deletion), use of PowerShell and CMD for potentially malicious commands, registry modifications, and WMIC trying to delete processes. These activities don't seem normal. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination and the nature of the commands (deleting users, processes, modifying registry) point towards a possible security incident. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: user deletion commands (net.exe, cmd.exe), WMIC process deletion, frequent PowerShell and conhost.exe registry modifications, and potential tampering with security-related DLLs (MpOAV.dll).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. Hmm, there's a lot of process creation events, mostly for common utilities like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe. But wait, some of the command lines stand out. For example, there's a cmd.exe command that's deleting a user with \"net user ... \/del \/domain\". That seems suspicious because deleting domain users isn't typical for normal operations. Also, there's another cmd.exe command trying to delete a service with \"sc delete win32times\". Deleting services could be part of a malicious activity, like removing security software.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of powershell.exe and registry events. While PowerShell is common, the combination with registry changes might indicate configuration changes or persistence mechanisms. The repeated use of \"Registry value set\" could be an attempt to modify system settings or hide the malicious activity.\n\nHowever, some of these events are normal. For example, whoami.exe is a standard tool for checking user context. But the presence of multiple process creations and registry modifications, especially with commands that modify user accounts and services, raises a red flag. The confidence isn't 100% because some events could be legitimate, but the combination of these actions suggests potential malicious behavior. I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: deletion of domain users via 'net user \/del \/domain', deletion of system services via 'sc delete', and repeated registry modifications.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of chrome.exe triggering Network connection detected events. Chrome doing network activity is normal, especially if it's browsing the web. But seeing it multiple times might be a red flag if it's connecting to unusual destinations, but the logs don't mention the destination IPs or domains. So maybe not suspicious on its own.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe creating a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_logico.txt. Creating files isn't inherently bad, but if it's part of a larger pattern, like downloading malicious files, that could be an issue. However, just creating a text file might be benign, like saving a download.\n\nNext, chrome.exe is setting registry values. Again, this could be normal if it's part of its own operations, but repeated registry changes might indicate something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file is normal during setup or updates. Not suspicious here.\n\nAnother powershell.exe creating estrutura_ativo.txt. Similar to the first file creation, maybe just a text file. Still not a clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nProcess accessed events for powershell.exe and others. Accessing processes is normal, but if it's accessing processes that shouldn't be accessed, that's a problem. But the logs don't specify which processes are being accessed.\n\nThe whoami.exe execution is straightforward; it's a common command to check user context. Not suspicious.\n\nThen there's a cmd.exe command that deletes scheduled tasks. The command line shows deleting tasks named \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be part of cleaning up, but if these tasks were malicious, deleting them might be a defensive action. However, if the user didn't initiate this, it could be suspicious. But without knowing the original tasks' purposes, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother cmd.exe instance with a command that deletes more scheduled tasks. Again, similar reasoning applies. The use of schtasks.exe to delete tasks is a normal administrative action.\n\nThe schtasks.exe entries show process creation, which is normal. The image loaded event for taskschd.dll is part of the Task Scheduler, so that's expected.\n\nThe svchost.exe registry event is also normal, as svchost hosts various system services.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the multiple chrome.exe network connections and the deletion of scheduled tasks. However, without more context on the network destinations or the nature of the scheduled tasks, it's hard to confirm malicious intent. The file creations and registry changes could be part of normal operations. The presence of multiple events might indicate some automated process, but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination of network activity, file creation, and task deletion could be part of a larger attack, like exfiltrating data or setting up persistence. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious activity beyond normal operations, I'm leaning towards \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. However, if the network connections were to known bad IPs or the files contained malicious content, it would be different. Since the logs don't provide that info, I can't be certain. So, the classification is \"NOT INTERESTING\" but with a confidence around 0.5 because there's some unusual activity but not enough to confirm a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The events show normal user activity (e.g., Chrome network connections, file creation by PowerShell, and scheduled task deletions via CMD).

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I notice multiple entries involving cmd.exe and powershell.exe. The first event shows cmd.exe running a command to delete temporary files. That's a bit suspicious because deleting files, especially in the Temp directory, could be part of cleaning up after an attack. But maybe it's just a normal process?\n\nThen there are several instances of powershell.exe being accessed and creating processes. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so that's a red flag. The command_line entries with \"powershell.exe & {}\" might be obfuscation techniques to hide malicious activities. \n\nLooking at the file events, there's a File Delete logged event for a file in the Temp directory. Deleting files can be normal, but combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate an attempt to remove evidence. \n\nThe Image loaded events for PowerShell include some system DLLs, which might be normal, but the presence of Defender's MpOAV.dll could be relevant. However, the main concern here is the repeated use of PowerShell and the deletion of temporary files. \n\nAlso, the Registry value set events might indicate changes to the system configuration, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple PowerShell processes, deletion of temporary files, and registry changes suggests potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181122.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a lot of activity related to PowerShell.exe. There are multiple entries where PowerShell is accessing processes and the registry. Now, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities, so that's not necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nBut then I see an event where the file path is 'C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender\\\\Platform\\\\4.18.25030.2-0\\\\MpClient.dll'. Wait, Windows Defender's MpClient.dll is a legitimate file, but the path here seems a bit off. Typically, Windows Defender files are in the System32 directory or under Program Files, not in ProgramData. ProgramData is often used for application data, so having a system file there might be suspicious. It could be a sign of a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate one, maybe a dropper or something trying to evade detection.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple instances of 'Process accessed' events for PowerShell, which could indicate that someone is trying to manipulate or inject code into other processes. Also, there are several 'Registry value set' events for different processes like conhost.exe, svchost.exe, and others. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.\n\nHowever, there are also entries where 'whoami.exe' is being executed. Whoami is a standard Windows utility that displays user information, so that's normal. But the fact that it's being called repeatedly might be part of a script or a check for privileges. But on its own, that's not necessarily malicious.\n\nAnother point is the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so if it's creating a configuration file, that's normal. However, the file name has a '.new' extension, which might indicate that it's a temporary file during configuration updates. Not sure if that's suspicious here.\n\nPutting it all together: The main red flags are the unusual file path for MpClient.dll and the repeated process access events for PowerShell. The registry modifications could be part of a larger attack, but without more context like network activity or unusual command-line arguments, it's a bit hard to tell. However, the combination of these events does suggest potential malicious activity, even if it's not conclusive. So I'd classify this as interesting but with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events involving PowerShell.exe accessing processes and registry values, combined with an unusual file path for MpClient.dll (located in ProgramData instead of typical system directories), suggest potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nThe first event is ApplicationFrameHost.exe with a registry value set. That's part of the Windows system process, so maybe normal. But I should note that. Then there's powershell.exe with a process accessed event. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities. But just accessing a process isn't necessarily bad. \n\nThen there are multiple chrome.exe entries. The tasks here are DNS queries and network connections. Chrome is a common browser, so DNS queries and network connections are normal. However, the number of events might be a clue. Let me count: there are four DNS queries and four network connections from chrome.exe. That's a lot, but maybe just part of normal browsing. However, if they're all going to the same destination or unusual domains, that could be a red flag. But the data here doesn't specify the domains or IPs involved. \n\nWait, the problem is that all the events are from chrome.exe doing normal things. But the presence of powershell.exe accessing a process might be a sign of something. However, without more context, like if the process access is to a sensitive process or if there's any anomalous behavior, it's hard to say. \n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe is part of the Windows shell, so its registry activity might be normal. The key here is whether these events are part of a larger pattern. Since there's no information about unusual domains, unexpected network connections, or other suspicious activities, it's hard to classify this as interesting. \n\nBut maybe the sheer number of events? However, the user hasn't provided any thresholds for what's considered normal. Without more data, like baseline behavior, it's challenging. The justification would need to be that there's no clear malicious activity detected. The confidence is probably low because there's no obvious signs of compromise. So, the classification would be NOT INTERESTING because the events are typical for the mentioned processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events represent typical process behavior (browser DNS queries, normal process access) without indicators of compromise or anomalous patterns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}
