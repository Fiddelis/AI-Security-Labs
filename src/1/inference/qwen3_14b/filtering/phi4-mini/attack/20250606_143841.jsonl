My task is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. Let's start by looking through the events.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to 'powershell.exe'. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The events include process accesses, registry value sets, image loads, and file operations. \n\nLooking at the specific events, there's a command line for powershell.exe that includes creating a new PSDrive with a network path: \"New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$\". That seems suspicious because accessing a remote share (like \\\\Target\\\\C$) might indicate trying to access another machine's file system, which could be part of lateral movement in an attack. \n\nThen there's a file created in the Temp directory: \"__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1\". The fact that a script is created and then immediately deleted (File Delete logged) might be an attempt to execute a script without leaving traces. However, the deletion is logged, which could be a red flag if the script was malicious. \n\nOther events include loading of DLLs like mscoreei.dll and clrjit.dll, which are part of .NET, so that's normal. But the presence of MpClient.dll from Windows Defender might indicate that the system is scanning or that the process is interacting with the antivirus, which could be a sign of detection or evasion attempts.\n\nThere are multiple 'Process accessed' events for powershell.exe, which is common but when combined with other suspicious activities, it might indicate something is going on. The 'whoami.exe' commands are usually benign, just checking user context, but repeated executions might be part of information gathering.\n\nHowever, I should check if all these events are part of normal operations. For example, creating and deleting temporary files is common, but the specific script name and the network drive creation are more concerning. Also, the repeated use of PowerShell with various rules (ProcessCreate, RegistryEvent, etc.) might be indicative of an attack chain, like initial access, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.\n\nBut wait, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The events could be part of a legitimate script that's testing permissions or accessing remote resources. However, the combination of creating a network drive, executing scripts in temp, and multiple process accesses could be part of a more complex attack. \n\nConsidering the confidence, I think there's enough suspicious activity to warrant further investigation. The classification should be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.7. The justification is the suspicious network drive creation and temporary script handling, which are common in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands (e.g., creating a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$), combined with temporary script creation and deletion, suggest potential malicious activity or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user is asking me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The main thing here is to look at all the events together and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. That's common, but when combined with certain actions, it can be a red flag. Let me go through each event.\n\nThe first event is a Process Create for PowerShell with a command line of \"& {}\", which seems like a no-op. Not too suspicious on its own. Then there are several Image Load events for various DLLs, like mscoree.dll, clr.dll, and others related to .NET Framework and Windows Defender. These are legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. However, the presence of multiple Image Loads could indicate that PowerShell is being used to load additional components, maybe for executing scripts.\n\nThen there's a File Created event for a temporary script file named __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1. That's in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but the name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\" which might be related to PowerShell execution policies. However, the file is then deleted, which is also normal. But the fact that it's created and deleted quickly might be part of a script execution.\n\nAnother File Created event is for StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That could be related to PowerShell profiles, which are used to run scripts when PowerShell starts. If an attacker is trying to persist access, they might modify these profiles. However, the event doesn't show any modification, just creation. But combined with other events, maybe there's something here.\n\nThere are several Process Access and Registry Event entries. Process Access might indicate that another process is interacting with PowerShell, which could be normal or malicious. The Registry Event could be changing settings, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe is normal; it's a standard command to check user context. But the multiple PowerShell processes and the Image Loads might be part of a larger attack. For example, if PowerShell is being used to load malicious DLLs or execute scripts. However, all the DLLs here are from legitimate locations like System32 and Microsoft.NET. The only suspicious part is the temporary script file and the repeated Image Loads, but those could be part of normal operations too.\n\nWait, but the first event's command line is \"& {}\", which is an empty command. That might be a way to bypass detection by creating a process with a harmless command line. Then, the subsequent events might be part of a chain where the actual malicious activity is happening through other means, like loading DLLs or creating files. However, without more context, like the actual content of the script or the purpose of the Image Loads, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the same PowerShell process is being accessed multiple times, and there are multiple Image Loads. This could be part of a legitimate process, but in some cases, attackers use PowerShell to inject code or execute scripts in memory, avoiding writing to disk. However, in this case, a temporary file is created and deleted, which might be a sign of that.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch shows multiple PowerShell activities, creation and deletion of a temporary script, and loading of various system DLLs. While some of these are normal, the combination might indicate an attempt to execute a script or bypass security policies. However, without more evidence like unusual command lines, network activity, or unauthorized access, it's a bit ambiguous. The confidence here would be moderate, maybe around 60%, because there are some suspicious elements but not enough to confirm malicious intent definitively.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events shows **moderate suspicious activity** that warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Repeated PowerShell Activity:**\n   - Multiple `Process Create` and `Process Access` events for `powershell.exe`, including one with a no-op command (`& {}`). While common, this could indicate an attempt to bypass detection by using a seemingly benign command line.\n   - The creation and deletion of a temporary script file (`__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1`) in the Temp directory. This is consistent with PowerShell execution policy testing but could also be part of script execution or persistence attempts.\n\n2. **Image Load Events:**\n   - Several `Image Load` events for system DLLs (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`, `whoami.exe`). These are legitimate system files, but the frequency of these events combined with PowerShell activity might suggest an attempt to leverage .NET or Windows Defender components for malicious purposes (e.g., code injection or reflective execution).\n\n3. **Registry and Process Access:**\n   - Multiple `Registry value set` and `Process Access` events. While not inherently malicious, they could indicate attempts to modify system settings or interact with other processes, which may be part of lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\n4. **Legitimate vs. Suspicious Context:**\n   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and standard system DLLs does not confirm malicious intent. However, the combination of **temporary file creation\/deletion**, **repeated PowerShell process creation**, and **unusual registry activity** raises flags for potential **script execution**, **persistence**, or **bypassing execution policies**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Matters:**\n- **PowerShell misuse** is a common attack vector (e.g., for command-line attacks, script execution, or lateral movement). The temporary script file and no-op command line may be attempts to evade detection.\n- **Image Load events** for system DLLs could be part of legitimate operations, but in the context of repeated PowerShell activity, they might indicate **DLL hijacking** or **in-memory execution** (e.g., using `Add-Type` or reflective loading).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n- **Correlate with Other Data:** Check for network activity, user context (e.g., admin rights), or unusual command-line arguments in PowerShell (e.g., `-Command`, `-File`).\n- **Inspect the Script File:** Analyze the content of `__PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1` (if available) for malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Monitor for Persistence:** Investigate if the PowerShell profile (`StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) was modified to execute malicious scripts on startup.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe events are **not definitively malicious**, but the **combination of PowerShell activity, temporary script handling, and system DLL loading** suggests **potential reconnaissance or exploitation**. A **moderate risk level** (60–70% confidence) is appropriate, requiring further analysis of context (e.g., user behavior, network traffic, file content)."}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There are several Image loaded events pointing to .dll files in the Windows directory, like mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and others. These are part of the .NET Framework, so they might be legitimate. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here. For example, loading clrjit.dll or MpOAV.dll, which is part of Windows Defender. That seems normal too.\n\nThen there's a File created event for a temporary PowerShell script, and then it's deleted. That's common during script execution, but maybe if it's doing something malicious. However, the script's path is in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory, which is typical for temporary files. The name includes \"__PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to testing script policies, possibly legitimate.\n\nThere are also Pipe Created events and Process accessed events. The Pipe Created might be part of normal PowerShell operations, but sometimes attackers use named pipes for communication. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes, there's a check for the existence of \"procdump.exe\" in a specific path. ProcDump is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals used for dumping processes, but it can also be abused by attackers. The path mentioned here is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". The \"..\\\\registro_secundario\" part might be a way to traverse directories, but I need to check if that's suspicious. However, without knowing the actual structure of the file system, it's hard to say. The command is checking if the file exists, which could be part of a script that's trying to locate procDump for some purpose.\n\nAnother thing to note is the repeated Process accessed events. These could indicate that PowerShell is interacting with other processes, which might be normal, but if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be a sign of something malicious.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe being executed is normal, as it's a built-in Windows utility. However, if it's being used in conjunction with PowerShell for privilege escalation or information gathering, that might be a concern.\n\nNow, considering all these events together, the majority seem to be legitimate system activities related to PowerShell and .NET components. However, the check for procdump.exe and the temporary script creation and deletion might be worth investigating further. But without more context, like if procDump is being used in an unexpected way or if there are other signs of compromise, it's not conclusive. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some potentially suspicious elements, they could also be part of normal operations.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe activities include loading .NET DLLs, creating\/deleting temporary scripts, and checking for procdump.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell.exe loading various DLLs. The first one is clr.dll, which is part of the .NET Framework. That's normal. The second one is System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, which is related to PowerShell's execution. The third one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Loading this might be part of the system's normal operations, but it's worth noting.\n\nThen there's a File Delete event where a temporary PowerShell script is deleted. That's a bit suspicious because deleting a script after execution could be an attempt to cover tracks. Next, there's a Pipe Created event, which might be normal, but combined with other actions could indicate something.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple Process Access events for PowerShell and other processes. The whoami.exe executions are normal, but the fact that they're logged might not be a big issue. However, the cmd.exe process running a command to disable the firewall is a red flag. Disabling the firewall would leave the system vulnerable, which is a clear sign of malicious activity.\n\nThen there's a netsh.exe process executing the same firewall disabling command. That's another strong indicator. The svchost.exe entries are related to registry changes. While svchost.exe is a normal system process, multiple registry events might be part of a persistence mechanism or configuration changes by an attacker.\n\nPutting it all together: the combination of disabling the firewall, deleting temporary scripts, and multiple registry modifications by svchost.exe suggests a possible attack. The PowerShell activities, along with the firewall disablement, point to an attempt to compromise the system and maintain access. Even though some events are normal, the overall pattern is suspicious enough to warrant investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: PowerShell loading potentially malicious DLLs, deletion of temporary script files, firewall disablement via netsh, and excessive registry modifications by svchost.exe.

{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, all with the same structure. Each entry has a process named 'svchost.exe' and a winlog event about a registry object being added or deleted. There's no file information mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what svchost.exe is. It's a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, it's also commonly abused by malware to hide malicious activities. The fact that there are multiple entries here might indicate something. But wait, how many entries are there? Let me count. There are 30 entries, all identical. That's a lot of the same event.\n\nNow, the winlog task is \"Registry object added or deleted (rule: RegistryEvent)\". This could be normal system activity, but if there's a high volume of such events, especially from svchost.exe, it might be suspicious. However, the key here is that all the events are the same. If they were different, maybe pointing to different registry keys or user activities, that might be more concerning. But since they're all the same, maybe it's a false positive or a benign event being logged repeatedly.\n\nBut wait, why would svchost.exe trigger so many registry events? Typically, registry changes are monitored for security. If a legitimate process is making many registry changes, that's unusual. However, svchost.exe can host multiple services, and if one of those services is malicious, it could be modifying the registry. But without more context, like the specific registry keys involved, user context, or other processes, it's hard to say.\n\nThe user is asking whether this batch is interesting for investigation. The classification depends on whether there's enough evidence to warrant further look. The repetition of the same event might be a red flag. However, in a real scenario, I would check for other indicators, like if these events are part of a known benign activity, or if there's a pattern that's not normal.\n\nBut given the information here, all the events are the same. That's a bit odd. Usually, if a process is doing something repeatedly, especially in the registry, that could be a sign of persistence mechanisms, like creating or modifying registry keys to ensure the malware starts on boot. However, without knowing which registry keys are involved, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut since all the entries are identical, maybe it's a logging error or a test. However, the confidence level would be medium. The justification would be that while svchost.exe is legitimate, the high volume of identical registry events might indicate potential malicious activity. However, without more data, it's not certain. Therefore, the classification would be \"INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.6, as it's not conclusive but raises flags that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical events from svchost.exe related to registry changes may indicate potential malicious activity, though further context is needed to confirm.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}

The user provided a batch of events, mostly from svchost.exe with registry events. The first 20 entries are all about registry objects being added or deleted, and then there's a change to a registry value set and a pipe created event. Then there are several PowerShell commands that look suspicious.\n\nHmm, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but it's often used by malware to hide activities. The repeated registry events might be normal, but when combined with the PowerShell commands, that's a red flag. The command line shows New-PSDrive being used to map a network drive to a remote machine's C$ share. That's commonly done in attacks to access files on the target system. \n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple instances of the same command suggests automation or a script running.

So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of events and determine if they're interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the JSON entries, most of them are PowerShell commands. The first few entries have the command line 'powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -unidade_auxiliar \\\\Target\\\\C$}'. Hmm, New-PSDrive is used to create a new drive mapping. The -unidade_auxiliar part might be a typo or a non-English term, maybe 'unit auxiliary'? But the key part here is that they're mapping a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That could be a red flag because mapping a remote drive, especially to a target machine's C$ share, might be part of an attack, like trying to access files or escalate privileges.\n\nThen there are several entries with 'powershell.exe & {}', which is an empty script block. That might just be a placeholder or a test, but repeated multiple times could indicate some kind of probing or testing activity. However, without any actual commands, it's hard to tell if it's malicious. But the repetition might be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a bunch of entries with a more complex command: checking if a file exists at 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe'. The path seems a bit convoluted. The '..' suggests moving up a directory, which might be an attempt to access a file in a parent directory. Procdump.exe is a legitimate tool used for capturing process dumps, but it's also commonly used by attackers for memory dumping. The fact that they're checking for its existence could mean they're trying to see if it's present on the system, possibly to use it for dumping memory or other malicious purposes.\n\nNow, looking at the winlog 'task' fields. The first set of events have 'Engine Lifecycle' and 'Provider Lifecycle' tasks. I'm not entirely sure what those tasks refer to, but they might be part of some system or application's internal processes. However, the repetition of these tasks along with the PowerShell commands could indicate some automated or scripted activity.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial drive mapping to a remote C$ share is suspicious. Then, the repeated checks for procdump.exe in a potentially manipulated path might be part of an attack chain. Even though some commands are empty, the presence of these specific PowerShell commands and the checks for procdump.exe could be indicators of malicious activity. However, without more context like user accounts, other system events, or network traffic, it's a bit hard to be 100% certain. But considering the combination of these events, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell commands attempt to map remote drives (e.g., \\\\Target\\\\C$) and check for the presence of procdump.exe in suspicious paths, which may indicate reconnaissance or preparation for memory dumping.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
