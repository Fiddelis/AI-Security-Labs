{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there's a lot of activity with powershell.exe and cmd.exe. The winlog tasks mention Process accessed and Process Create. Then, there's a command line in one of the cmd.exe entries that looks suspicious. It's using 'sc create' to set up a service with a binPath pointing to a script that doesn't exist (NonExistingScript.ps1). That seems like a red flag because creating a service with a non-existent script might be an attempt to execute malicious code later.\n\nLooking further, there's an entry where sc.exe is used again to create a service, and then another where it queries the service configuration. That could be part of setting up a persistence mechanism. Also, there are multiple Registry value set events, which might indicate changes to the system's configuration, possibly to hide the malicious activity or modify existing settings.\n\nThe Image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal since that's a legitimate Windows DLL, but it's being loaded by processes like calc.exe and Calculator.exe. However, the presence of multiple ImageLoad events might not be suspicious on their own unless there's an unusual context. \n\nAnother point is the file creation event for winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file created is a .yml.new file, which might be part of a configuration change. But unless there's something wrong with the configuration, this might just be normal operation.\n\nPutting it all together: the suspicious activities are the use of sc.exe to create services pointing to non-existent scripts, multiple registry changes, and repeated process accesses. These could be signs of an attacker trying to establish persistence or execute code. However, some of these events could be benign if the scripts are part of a legitimate setup. But given the non-existent file names and the service creation, it leans towards malicious intent. \n\nThe confidence is a bit over 0.7 because while there are some suspicious elements, without more context (like the actual content of the scripts or other indicators), it's not 100% certain. But the combination of events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: repeated PowerShell\/cmd.exe process access, registry modifications, and service creation attempts with non-existent script paths (e.g., 'c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1'). These patterns are commonly associated with malware persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/phi4-mini\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting or not. The user provided a list of system events in JSONL format. Each line is a separate event with details about the process, winlog task, and file information.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first few entries are about ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, and powershell.exe having registry values set. Registry changes can be normal, but if they're from legitimate processes, maybe not suspicious. However, if it's from something unexpected, that's a red flag.\n\nThen there's an event where powershell.exe is accessed by another process. That might be normal, but sometimes attackers use PowerShell for malicious activities. However, just one instance might not be enough to raise an alarm.\n\nLooking at the chrome.exe events, there are multiple entries about registry value sets. Chrome is a common application, so some registry changes are expected. However, the repetition might indicate something. Wait, there's also an image loaded event for chrome.exe with amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. AMSI is part of Windows Defender, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but if they're being loaded from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths (C:\\Windows\\System32\\amsi.dll and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender...). So that seems legitimate.\n\nNow, considering all events together. The majority are from Chrome and PowerShell, which are common processes. The registry changes and process access events might be part of normal operations. However, the repetition of registry events for chrome.exe might be a sign of something. But without more context, like unusual parameters or unexpected parent processes, it's hard to tell. The image load events for Defender DLLs are normal.\n\nI should check if there's any combination of events that could indicate malicious activity. For example, if a malicious process is modifying the registry and loading suspicious DLLs. But in this case, all the processes mentioned are legitimate. The only possible red flag is the multiple registry changes, but that's not necessarily malicious. \n\nSince there's no indication of malicious activity, such as unexpected file paths, unusual process names, or known malicious behaviors, the classification would be \"NOT INTERESTING.\" The confidence is medium because while there are multiple events, they don't clearly point to a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events involve common processes (chrome.exe, powershell.exe) performing typical operations (registry modifications, image loading of legitimate system DLLs). No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
