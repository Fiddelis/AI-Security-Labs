The first thing I notice is that there's a 'whoami.exe' process running, which is normal as it's a built-in Windows utility.

That's a common tactic used by malware to execute scripts temporarily without leaving traces.\n\nThe repeated 'Provider Lifecycle' events might be related to PowerShell's execution policy or some other security feature, but they're not necessarily malicious on their own. However, when combined with the search for passwords and the temporary file creation, it raises a red flag. \n\nI should check if the PowerShell commands are part of a legitimate script or if they're being used for malicious purposes. The fact that the user is searching through files for passwords suggests they might be trying to gather sensitive information.

So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell activity. The first event has a command line that uses findstr and select-string to search for 'pass' and 'password' in various file types. That seems like someone is trying to find passwords in files. That's a red flag. Then there's another instance of the same command line later on, which might indicate that this is part of a search for sensitive information.\n\nOther events include normal processes like notepad.exe, calc.exe, and svchost.exe. The file creation by winlogbeat.exe might be part of a legitimate setup, but the PowerShell commands are more concerning. The fact that the same PowerShell command is used multiple times could be an attempt to search through files systematically. \n\nAlso, there are registry events and process accesses, but nothing that's immediately malicious. However, the repeated use of PowerShell to search for passwords might be part of a data exfiltration attempt. Even though there's no direct evidence of data being exfiltrated, the search for passwords in files is a suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.\n\nI should check if there are any other anomalies. The presence of 'findstr' and 'select-string' with patterns like 'password' is typically associated with reconnaissance activities. Since this is happening multiple times, it's more likely to be malicious. \n\nSo, the classification here would be \"INTERESTING\" because the repeated PowerShell commands searching for sensitive information are indicative of potential malicious behavior.

The file path is in the Downloads directory, which might be normal. But then there's another event where powershell.exe creates a file called estrutura_ativo.txt. Not sure yet, but maybe that's part of normal user activity.\n\nThen there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed or creating processes. Also, some registry events. But what stands out is the use of schtasks.exe with commands to delete scheduled tasks. The command lines show deleting tasks like \"unidade_geral_005_OnLogon\" and \"unidade_comum_005_OnStartup\". Deleting scheduled tasks could be suspicious, especially if it's part of removing something malicious. However, it's also possible that the user is just cleaning up old tasks.\n\nAnother thing is the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various commands. The command_line in one of the events uses wmic to delete notepad.exe processes.

So, the user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events are related to chrome.exe performing various tasks. There's a lot of Registry value set events, which might be normal for Chrome, but maybe not. Then there are Dns queries, which are common, but again, could be part of normal browsing. However, there's also an Image loaded event for amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antivirus, and MpOAV.dll is related to Windows Defender as well. If Chrome is loading these files, that might be unusual. Normally, these would be loaded by the Defender processes themselves, not by Chrome. That could indicate something malicious trying to bypass detection by using legitimate system files.\n\nThen there's a file created by winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. But the path seems to be a temporary file during installation, so that might be normal. However, there's also a file created by powershell.exe named objeto_logico.txt. Not sure what that is, but maybe it's just a normal file. However, the presence of that file might be benign unless there's more context.\n\nLooking at the confidence, the key points are the ImageLoad events for Defender DLLs by Chrome. That's suspicious. Also, the repeated Registry changes might be part of a configuration change, but if done by a legitimate process, it's okay. However, combined with the ImageLoad events, it's more concerning. The Dns queries are common, but maybe if they were to malicious domains, but the logs don't show that. \n\nSo, the main red flags are the unexpected ImageLoad of Defender DLLs by Chrome. That's unusual and could indicate a malicious process trying to use those DLLs for some purpose, like evasion. The other events are more routine. So, this batch is interesting because of those two ImageLoad events. The confidence might be around 0.75 because there are a few suspicious events but not overwhelming evidence.

So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. The classification can be either INTERESTING or NOT INTERESTING, with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the logs. Let's see... There are several entries involving powershell.exe, cmd.exe, and WMIC.exe. The tasks mentioned include Process Access, Registry value set, and Image Load. Some of the files loaded are urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and MpOAV.dll. Those DLLs are part of Windows Defender, so loading them might be normal, but maybe not always.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there's a WMIC command that deletes a process called notepad.exe. That seems suspicious because using WMIC to delete processes can be a sign of malicious activity. Also, the use of cmd.exe to delete user accounts with commands like net user \/del might be part of an attack to remove administrative users. \n\nThen there's the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with registry events. While registry changes can be normal, the frequency here might indicate something. Also, the presence of multiple process creations and accesses could be part of a larger attack chain.\n\nAnother thing is the use of net1.exe, which isn't a standard Windows tool. The command line shows a path with \"net1.exe\" which might be a typo or a malicious binary. That's a red flag. \n\nThe logs also show multiple instances of ProcessAccess and RegistryEvent rules being triggered. If these are part of normal operations, they might not be interesting, but the combination with suspicious commands and non-standard executables suggests potential malicious activity.\n\nHowever, I should consider that some of these could be legitimate. For example, using WMIC to manage processes or PowerShell for scripting. But the deletion of user accounts and the loading of specific DLLs might be more indicative of an attack. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of deleting processes, modifying registry values, using suspicious executables, and deleting user accounts points towards a potential security incident. Therefore, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence level around 0.85. The justification is the suspicious commands and the use of tools typically associated with malicious activities.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: WMIC process deletion, loading of potentially malicious DLLs (urlmon.dll, amsi.dll), repeated registry modifications, and user account deletion attempts via cmd.exe.

So, first, I need to go through each entry and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe is involved in a registry value set. That's a common activity, but not necessarily malicious. Then there's a cmd.exe process that's trying to delete temporary files. The command line shows it's deleting files in the Temp directory. That could be normal cleanup, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious code. \n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. The cmd.exe also has a file delete event for a specific executable in the Temp folder. That might be part of a cleanup after an attack. Then there are several entries with 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' tasks, which might be related to PowerShell's internal processes, but the repeated entries could be suspicious if they're part of an automated attack.\n\nThe image loaded events for .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, and mscorlib.ni.dll are normal for PowerShell when running .NET code. However, if these are being loaded in an unusual context, it might indicate something malicious. \n\nPutting it all together, the combination of registry changes, file deletions in Temp, multiple PowerShell processes, and loading of .NET assemblies could indicate an attack. The deletion of files might be part of an attempt to remove evidence. However, I need to check if there's any clear malicious activity. The command line for cmd.exe shows deletion commands, which could be benign, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it's a red flag. \n\nI should consider the confidence level. Since there are multiple suspicious events but no direct evidence of malware or unauthorized access, it's somewhat indicative but not certain.

Those are normal administrative activities, so maybe not a red flag yet. But then I see entries with processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe. PowerShell is often used for legitimate tasks, but it can also be abused for malicious purposes. \n\nLooking closer, there's a command line in one of the entries: \"net user \\\"modulo_auxiliar_Admin\\\" >nul 2>&1 \/del \/domain\". Deleting a user account might be part of a privilege escalation or lateral movement. Also, another entry has \"sc delete win32times\" which is deleting a service. That could be an attempt to remove a service that's monitoring or logging activities, which is suspicious.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of \"Process accessed\" events for powershell.exe. That might indicate someone is trying to manipulate or access processes, which isn't normal. Also, the use of \"conhost.exe\" and \"services.exe\" with registry events might be part of a larger attack, like modifying system settings or hiding malicious activities.\n\nI notice that \"net1.exe\" is used instead of \"net.exe\" in one command. That's unusual because the correct command would use \"net.exe\". Using a different executable might be a sign of a spoofed or malicious binary. Also, the path \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\net1\" is suspicious because system32 typically contains legitimate system files, and adding a \"net1.exe\" there might be a red herring.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of \"Registry value set\" and \"Registry object added or deleted\" events. Changing registry values can be part of persistence mechanisms or altering system behavior. The combination of these registry changes with process deletions and user account deletions suggests someone is trying to modify the system's configuration to maintain access or cover their tracks.\n\nHowever, I should check if these actions could be legitimate. For example, deleting a user or a service might be part of a system maintenance task. But the frequency and the specific commands used here, along with the suspicious executable names and the multiple access events on processes, lean towards malicious activity. \n\nThe confidence here is high because the combination of deleting user accounts, modifying registry entries, using suspicious executables, and accessing processes repeatedly points to an attack.

The tasks include Image loaded, File created, and File Delete logged. The files mentioned are some .dlls from Windows Defender and a temporary script file. The temp file is created and then deleted, which might be normal, but the fact that PowerShell is involved in creating and deleting it could be a red flag. \n\nWait, the first event has the file path as clrjit.dll, which is part of the .NET framework. That's a legitimate file, so that's probably okay. The second one is MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Also legitimate. Then there's a temp file created and deleted. Maybe that's part of a script execution, but not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The command line for one process is 'powershell.exe & {}', which seems like an empty command. Maybe a test or a benign operation.\n\nThere are multiple entries of Process accessed events for PowerShell. That could indicate that other processes are interacting with PowerShell, which might be normal, but if it's excessive, it could be a sign of something. Also, there are several instances of whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to check the current user, but if it's run multiple times, maybe in a script, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe winlogbeat.exe event is creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so that's probably part of its normal operation. The .yml.new file suggests it's configuring something, which is normal during setup.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a lot of PowerShell activity, but many of the files and processes involved are legitimate. The creation and deletion of the temp script file could be part of a normal PowerShell operation, like running a script that's then cleaned up. The repeated Process accessed events might be due to PowerShell's own operations or other processes interacting with it, but without seeing more unusual activity, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple PowerShell events, especially with file operations and process access, might be indicative of someone trying to execute scripts or manipulate the system. But since there's no clear evidence of malicious files, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation, it's possible that this is just normal user activity or testing.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit low.

Then there's whoami.exe being executed, which is a normal command to check user context. Not too bad.\n\nLooking further, there's RuntimeBroker.exe and notepad.exe modifying registry values. Those are usually legitimate processes. The svchost.exe entries are also normal, as they host various system services. The calc.exe and Calculator.exe entries loading urlmon.dll from System32 seem okay. That's a standard DLL for handling URLs.\n\nWait, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its normal operation.

Chrome doing normal browsing is expected. However, the repetition might be normal if the user is actively using the browser. No obvious malicious activity here.\n\nHmm, the main thing is that there's no clear indication of malicious activity. The processes involved are mostly legitimate, and the events don't show any unusual patterns like unexpected network connections, unauthorized access, or suspicious file modifications.
