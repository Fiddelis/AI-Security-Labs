{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze this batch of events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So, first, I'll look through each entry.\n\nStarting with the first few lines: there's a lot of 'powershell.exe' processes with 'Process accessed' and 'Process Create' events. One of them has a command line that's creating a new service called 'objeto_ativo' and starting it. That seems suspicious because creating a new service isn't normal behavior for a typical user. The command line uses New-Service and Start-Service, which are PowerShell cmdlets. The binary path points to a file in 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\entrada_base\\\\bin\\\\tarefa_logico.exe'. That path doesn't look standard; maybe it's a custom or malicious executable.\n\nThen there are several 'Image loaded' events for PowerShell, loading various DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are .NET related DLLs, which is normal for PowerShell, but the presence of multiple image loads might be part of the execution of a script. However, one of the image loads is 'MpOAV.dll' from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe it's being used here in an unexpected way.\n\nThere's a 'File created' and then 'File Delete logged' event for a temporary script file. That's common in PowerShell for running scripts, but the fact that it's created and then deleted quickly might be a sign of an attempt to hide activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Registry value set' events for 'services.exe'. That could indicate changes to the registry by the services process, which might be normal, but combined with other events, it could be part of a larger attack.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of a new service via PowerShell, loading of various DLLs, and the temporary file creation and deletion might indicate that someone is trying to execute a malicious script or install a backdoor. The service name 'objeto_ativo' doesn't seem to be a standard service, and the binary path is in a non-standard location. Also, the repeated registry changes by services.exe might be part of persistence mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I should check if any of these are normal. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, and creating a service might be part of legitimate automation. But the combination of creating a service, loading unusual DLLs, and the specific command line arguments with a non-standard binary path raises red flags. The fact that the script is creating a service and then immediately starting it could be an indicator of malicious activity.\n\nThe confidence level: there are enough suspicious activities here that I'd say it's interesting, but not 100% certain. Maybe 0.8 or 0.85. The justification would be the creation of a new service via PowerShell with a non-standard path, along with multiple image loads and file operations that might be part of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events indicate potential malicious activity, including creation of a suspicious service (objeto_ativo) with a non-standard binary path, repeated image loads of .NET DLLs, and temporary script file creation\/deletion.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first entry: services.exe has a registry value set. That's normal, as services.exe is a legitimate Windows process. But there are a bunch of entries here, all from services.exe and svchost.exe with registry changes. However, svchost.exe is also a standard process, so multiple registry events might be normal, but maybe too many?\n\nNext, there's tarefa_logico.exe loading several DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. Wait, those are all .NET framework components. Loading those isn't necessarily bad, but the process name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" doesn't ring a bell. I don't recognize that as a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a typo or a misinterpretation of the process name. Let me check again. The process name is 'tarefa_logico.exe'—maybe that's a Brazilian Portuguese term? \"Tarefa\" means task, \"lógico\" is logical. Not sure, but if that's a legitimate process, it should be known. However, if it's not, that could be suspicious. Also, loading multiple .NET DLLs might be part of a .NET application, but if this process is not supposed to be running, that's a red flag.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell.exe creating a file in the user's AppData directory. That's common for PowerShell profiles, but the file path mentioned is \"StartupProfileData-NonInteractive\". Maybe that's normal, but creating a file there isn't inherently bad. However, the next entry is PowerShell.exe setting a registry value. Again, not necessarily bad, but combined with other events?\n\nAnother entry is a file created by None (no process) in the WindowsUpdate logs. That might be a log file generated by the system, so probably benign.\n\nLooking at the frequency: services.exe and svchost.exe have multiple registry events. But if they're all legitimate, that's okay. However, the presence of tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs might be more concerning. Let me think: if a malicious process is using .NET components to execute code, that could be part of a payload. However, without more context, like unexpected command-line arguments or network activity, it's hard to tell. But the fact that a non-standard process is loading multiple .NET DLLs could be indicative of something.\n\nAlso, the number of registry events from services.exe and svchost.exe might be normal, but if they are all the same event, maybe there's a loop or a script causing repeated changes. However, the logs don't show any anomalies in the registry keys themselves, just that they were set.\n\nAnother thing: the user mentioned that the process name is 'tarefa_logico.exe'. If that's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be 'taskhost.exe' or another legitimate process. But if it's actually 'tarefa_logico.exe', that's not a known process. So that's a point in favor of being interesting.\n\nPutting it all together: the main suspicious points are the unknown process loading .NET DLLs multiple times. Even though those DLLs are legitimate, the process name is not recognized. That could be a sign of a malicious process masquerading as something else or a legitimate process that's being used in an unexpected way. The other events (registry changes by services.exe, svchost, etc.) are common and not necessarily indicative of a problem. The PowerShell events are also common, but without more context, they don't stand out. Therefore, the presence of tarefa_logico.exe loading .NET DLLs might be the key here. It's not enough to confirm a threat, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. So the answer would be that this is interesting and needs more analysis.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries include a mix of normal system activity and potential anomalies. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate Processes with Normal Activity:**\n   - **`services.exe`**, **`svchost.exe`**, and **`MsMpEng.exe`** (Microsoft Defender) are standard Windows processes. Their registry modifications and file operations (e.g., log creation) align with typical system behavior.\n   - **`PowerShell.exe`** creating a file in `%AppData%` (e.g., `StartupProfileData-NonInteractive`) is common for profile initialization and not inherently suspicious.\n\n2. **Suspicious Activity:**\n   - **`tarefa_logico.exe`** (unrecognized process name) is loading multiple **.NET Framework DLLs** (e.g., `mscoree.dll`, `clr.dll`). While these DLLs are legitimate components of the .NET runtime, the process name is **not a known Microsoft or third-party application**. This raises concerns:\n     - **Unusual Process Name:** \"tarefa_logico.exe\" (Portuguese for \"logical task\") is not a standard Windows process. This could indicate a typo (e.g., `taskhost.exe`), a malicious process, or an obscure utility.\n     - **.NET DLL Loading:** While .NET applications legitimately load these DLLs, the absence of context (e.g., command-line arguments, parent process, or network activity) makes this behavior ambiguous. It could signal a **malicious payload** leveraging .NET for execution.\n\n3. **Volume of Events:**\n   - Repeated **registry modifications** by `services.exe` and `svchost.exe` might be benign (e.g., service configuration updates), but excessive or repetitive changes could hint at **scripting or automation** (e.g., a loop or malware activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment:**\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The logs do not confirm malicious activity, but the presence of an **unrecognized process (`tarefa_logico.exe`)** engaging with .NET components warrants further investigation.\n- **Critical Indicator:** The process name and lack of contextual information (e.g., file paths, command-line arguments) are red flags.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Verify the Process:** Check if `tarefa_logico.exe` is a legitimate application (e.g., via file signature, digital certificate, or reputation databases).\n2. **Check for Parent Processes:** Investigate the parent process of `tarefa_logico.exe` to determine its origin.\n3. **Analyze .NET Activity:** Monitor for unusual .NET execution patterns (e.g., unexpected assemblies, memory usage).\n4. **Correlate with Other Logs:** Look for network traffic, file modifications, or user activity linked to `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe logs are **interesting for investigation** due to the presence of an unrecognized process (`tarefa_logico.exe`) interacting with .NET components. While no definitive threat is identified, this behavior merits deeper analysis to rule out malicious activity."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nMost of the entries here are about svchost.exe performing registry value sets. That's a common system process, so by itself, that's not necessarily suspicious. However, there are a lot of them. Repeated registry changes by svchost could indicate something, but I need to check if there's more.\n\nThen, I see setup.exe creating several files in the Program Files (x86) directory under Microsoft EdgeCore. Files like msedge.exe, msedgewebview2.exe, and others. These are legitimate Microsoft Edge components, so creating them during installation might be normal. However, setup.exe is typically associated with installations, so maybe this is part of a legitimate Edge update or installation.\n\nWait, but there's also a setup.exe creating another setup.exe in the Installer folder. That might be part of the installation process. Also, there's an Image loaded event for taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. That's a system component, so again, not necessarily bad.\n\nBut here's a thought: if this is a legitimate installation, why are there so many registry changes by svchost.exe? Maybe the setup is modifying registry keys as part of the installation. However, svchost.exe is a host process for various system services. If multiple registry changes are happening, maybe it's part of a larger process, but it's not immediately clear.\n\nAnother point: the files being created are all part of Microsoft Edge. So if this is a legitimate Edge installation or update, then these events are normal. However, if the setup.exe is not from a legitimate source, that could be a problem. But the logs don't indicate the source of setup.exe here.\n\nThe presence of multiple registry changes and file creations could be part of a normal software installation. But the high number of registry events might be a red flag. However, without more context, like the user initiating an installation, it's hard to say. Since the user hasn't provided information about whether this is a legitimate action, I have to consider the possibility that it's malicious.\n\nBut wait, Microsoft Edge is a legitimate product. If this is an installation of Edge, then the events are normal. However, if the setup.exe is not from Microsoft, that's different. The logs don't show the process's origin, so that's a gap.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the classification should be \"NOT INTERESTING\" if it's a legitimate installation. But without knowing the context, maybe the system is being used to install Edge, which is normal. However, the high number of registry changes by svchost might be suspicious. But svchost can be involved in various tasks.\n\nAlternatively, if setup.exe is creating these files, and it's a legitimate installer, then it's okay. However, if the setup.exe is malicious, then it's bad. Since the logs don't show the source, maybe it's safer to classify this as interesting because there's a possibility that setup.exe is not legitimate. But without more info, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nHmm. The presence of multiple file creations under a legitimate software's directory might be part of a normal install. However, the repeated registry changes by svchost could be part of that process. But I'm not sure. Maybe the confidence is moderate. Let me check again.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Many svchost.exe registry changes: could be normal or part of a malicious activity.\n- setup.exe creating files in Microsoft Edge directories: likely part of an installation.\n- setup.exe creating another setup.exe in Installer folder: normal during installation.\n- Image load of taskschd.dll: normal.\n\nIf this is a legitimate Edge installation, then it's not interesting. However, without knowing if the user initiated this, or if the setup.exe is legitimate, it's hard to say. But the logs don't have any obvious signs of compromise. So maybe it's not interesting. However, the high number of registry changes might still be a point to consider.\n\nBut in the absence of other suspicious activity, like unexpected network connections, unusual processes, or modifications to critical system files, it's more likely a legitimate installation. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of logs indicates a mix of normal system activity and potential installation-related events. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **svchost.exe Registry Changes**:  \n   Repeated registry modifications by `svchost.exe` are typical during system operations, such as service management or updates. While excessive or unusual changes could signal malicious activity, the logs do not show anomalies (e.g., unauthorized keys or values). This alone is not suspicious.\n\n2. **setup.exe File Creations**:  \n   The `setup.exe` process is creating files in the `Microsoft EdgeCore` directory, including legitimate Edge components (e.g., `msedge.exe`, `msedgewebview2.exe`). These are consistent with a **legitimate Edge installation or update**. The presence of a nested `setup.exe` in the `Installer` folder is also common in self-contained installers.\n\n3. **Image Load of taskschd.dll**:  \n   The loading of `taskschd.dll` (Task Scheduler) by `setup.exe` is a normal part of system interactions during installation processes.\n\n4. **Lack of Malicious Indicators**:  \n   There are no signs of suspicious behavior (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized process execution, or modifications to critical system files). The events align with a **legitimate software installation**.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe logs do not show evidence of malicious activity. The events are consistent with a **legitimate Microsoft Edge installation or update**. While the volume of registry changes by `svchost.exe` might raise questions, it is not inherently suspicious without additional context (e.g., unexpected user behavior or system instability).\n\n**Classification**: **NOT INTERESTING** (Moderate Confidence).  \n**Reason**: The activity aligns with normal system and software installation processes. No clear indicators of compromise are present."}

My job is to determine if this entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the events involve svchost.exe and services.exe performing registry operations like setting values or adding\/deleting objects. That's normal for system processes, but when it's repeated multiple times, it might indicate something. However, there's also setup.exe involved. \n\nThen, looking further down, there are file creation events under setup.exe. The files created are in paths like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge_proxy.exe and similar. Also, there's a lnk file created in the Start Menu and Quick Launch. \n\nWait, setup.exe is typically associated with installation processes.

So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the entries, most of them involve 'setup.exe' performing registry operations. There are multiple instances of 'Registry value set' and 'Registry object added or deleted' events. Then there are a few 'Pipe Created' events also linked to 'setup.exe'. \n\nBut wait, there's also 'svchost.exe' creating files in the Windows Temp directory and in 'AppReadiness'. The file paths have names like APPX followed by random strings, which might be temporary files from app installations. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but when it's creating a lot of files in Temp, that could be normal or could be part of a malicious activity. \n\nNow, considering the combination of events: setup.exe is making multiple registry changes and creating pipes. Registry modifications can be benign, like during software installation, but excessive changes might indicate something malicious. Pipes are used for inter-process communication, and creating multiple pipes might be part of a larger attack. \n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity here. The presence of svchost.exe creating temporary files is common during system updates or installations. But the repeated registry changes by setup.exe could be a red flag. However, since setup.exe is a common installer, maybe it's just a legitimate installation. \n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The key points are the multiple registry modifications and pipe creations by setup.exe, and the svchost.exe creating many temporary files.

The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple file creation events by svchost.exe. The files are in the WindowsApps directory for EdgeGameAssist.exe and some in AppReadiness with paths that look like security identifiers (SIDs). The AppReadiness folder is part of Windows' App Readiness service, which is involved in preparing applications for installation. However, creating files here, especially with SIDs in the path, might be unusual. But I should check if this is normal behavior.\n\nThen there are several registry value set events by svchost.exe. Registry changes can be a red flag if they're modifying critical keys or adding unauthorized entries. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate process that hosts various system services, so some registry activity might be normal. But if there are multiple entries, maybe that's suspicious.\n\nNext, there's a RuntimeBroker.exe process setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is associated with apps in Windows, so maybe it's part of normal app operations. But again, multiple events could indicate something else.\n\nThen there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Write-Host 'Final result: 1'. This seems benign, just outputting a message. But the following events show image loads from various .dll files related to .NET Framework and PowerShell itself. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell to function, so that's expected.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events. The svchost.exe creating files in AppReadiness with SIDs might be part of legitimate system processes, but the repetition of the same file paths could indicate an issue. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The registry changes by svchost.exe could be part of normal service operations, but again, multiple entries might be a concern.\n\nThe PowerShell activities seem normal. The command is harmless, and the image loads are standard. However, the presence of multiple registry events and file creations might be more indicative of something if they were part of a larger pattern. But in this batch, the events don't show clear signs of malware or unauthorized access. The EdgeGameAssist.exe file is part of Microsoft Edge's Game Assist feature, which is legitimate. The other files in AppReadiness might be related to system readiness checks.\n\nPutting it all together, the events don't show clear malicious activity. They might be part of normal system operations or updates. However, the repetition of the same file creation and registry events could be a sign of something, but without more data, it's hard to confirm. The confidence is medium because there's no obvious malicious behavior, but the volume of events might warrant further investigation. However, since the user is asking if this is interesting for investigation, and there's no clear red flags, maybe it's not. But I need to be cautious. Alternatively, maybe the fact that svchost.exe is creating files in AppReadiness is unusual and could be a sign of compromise. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that it's not interesting, but I should check again.\n\nWait, the EdgeGameAssist.exe is in the WindowsApps folder, which is for Universal Windows Platform apps. If that's a legitimate installation, then it's okay. The AppReadiness files might be part of system processes. The PowerShell command is harmless. The image loads are normal. The registry changes by svchost.exe might be part of service startups. So overall, the events don't indicate a security incident. Therefore, the answer is that it's not interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe batch of events analyzed does not present clear indicators of malicious activity or security incidents. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **File Creation by `svchost.exe`**:\n   - **EdgeGameAssist.exe** in `WindowsApps` is part of Microsoft Edge's legitimate Game Assist feature.\n   - **AppReadiness files** with SIDs in their paths are associated with Windows' App Readiness service, which is normal during system updates or application installations. Repetition of these events might be due to routine system processes.\n\n2. **Registry Modifications**:\n   - Multiple `svchost.exe` and `RuntimeBroker.exe` registry writes are consistent with legitimate system and application behavior. No suspicious keys or unauthorized changes are indicated.\n\n3. **PowerShell Activity**:\n   - The `Write-Host` command is benign and likely part of a test or script.\n   - Loaded `.dll` files (e.g., `mscorlib.ni.dll`, `clr.dll`) are standard components of PowerShell and the .NET Framework, indicating normal execution.\n\n4. **No Red Flags**:\n   - No evidence of unexpected process injections, lateral movement, or anomalous network activity.\n   - The events align with typical system operations, such as updates, application launches, and service management.\n\n**Conclusion**: The events do not warrant further investigation as they appear to be part of legitimate system behavior. **Confidence Level**: Low (not interesting for investigation)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking through the events, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several 'Image loaded' events, which is normal because PowerShell uses various DLLs. However, I notice some specific paths. For example, there's a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That's a bit odd because those are legitimate files, but maybe there's something else going on here.\n\nThen there's a File created event with a path in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_...psm1. That filename looks like it could be related to PowerShell scripts. Also, there's a ProcessCreate event with a command line that's scanning INF files for defaultinstall sections. That might be part of checking for driver installations, but why would PowerShell be doing that? It's a bit suspicious.\n\nWait, the command line has a script that's looking for INF files with specific patterns. That could be part of a malicious activity trying to find install sections, maybe to exploit them. Also, the repeated loading of certain DLLs, especially from Windows Defender, might be normal, but combined with other events, it could indicate something.\n\nAnother thing is the Pipe Created events. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there are multiple pipes created, maybe that's part of a larger operation. However, there's not enough info here to confirm that.\n\nThe presence of multiple FileCreate events in Temp directories might be benign, like temporary script files, but combined with the ProcessCreate that's checking INF files, it could be part of a more complex attack. However, I need to check if there's anything that's clearly malicious.\n\nAlso, the user ran 'whoami.exe', which is a standard command to check user context. That's normal. But the PowerShell activities seem more involved. The script in the ProcessCreate event is checking for INF files with certain sections. Maybe that's part of a legitimate process, but in some contexts, that could be used to find install sections to modify or exploit.\n\nBut I don't see any clear signs of malware here. The files being accessed are legitimate system files. The only suspicious part is the script scanning INF files, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe the user is just testing script policies or performing some system checks. However, the combination of multiple PowerShell activities and the specific script might be worth investigating further. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think this is interesting enough to warrant an investigation. The confidence is moderate because while there are some suspicious elements, they could also be part of normal system operations.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there's a PowerShell process loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25050.5-0\\MpClient.dll. Wait, Windows Defender's files are usually in that location, but the version number here seems specific. However, the event is just an image load, which is normal for legitimate processes. Maybe not suspicious yet.\n\nNext, there's a cmd.exe command that uses DISM to disable the Windows Defender feature. The command line is \"Dism \/online \/Disable-Feature \/FeatureName:Windows-Defender \/Remove \/NoRestart \/quiet\". Disabling Windows Defender is a red flag because it's a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. But is this command legitimate? Well, DISM is a legitimate tool, but disabling Defender could be part of a malicious action. However, the user might have administrative rights and be doing this intentionally. Still, this is a suspicious activity that warrants investigation.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where Dism.exe is creating or detecting executable files in the user's Temp directory. The files are things like AppxProvider.dll, AssocProvider.dll, CbsProvider.dll, etc., all under a temporary folder. The fact that Dism is creating executables in the Temp directory is unusual. Normally, DISM is used for deployment and imaging, not for generating random DLLs in the Temp folder. These files are being created and detected as executables, which might indicate that something is trying to inject code or execute malicious payloads through DISM.\n\nPutting this all together: the initial disable of Windows Defender could be a prelude to removing security measures, and then the creation of multiple executable files in the Temp directory by Dism.exe is highly suspicious. Even though DISM is a legitimate tool, the combination of disabling Defender and generating numerous executables in a temporary directory is indicative of potential malicious activity. The presence of PowerShell and the specific paths might be part of a larger attack chain. However, without more context, like network activity or other process behaviors, it's a bit tricky. But based on the given events, the actions taken (disabling Defender and creating executables in Temp) are strong indicators of something worth investigating.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The batch includes disabling Windows Defender via DISM and creation of multiple executable files in the user's Temp directory by Dism.exe, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

But wait, .mui files aren't typically executables; they're more like DLLs for localization. However, the detection rule might be misconfigured or the files could be malicious. But looking at the filenames, they all have the same structure: DismCore.dll.mui, DismProv.dll.mui, etc. These seem like legitimate Windows components, possibly part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management (DISM) tool. \n\nThe fact that there are multiple files being detected here might be normal during a system update or deployment process. DISM is a legitimate tool used by Windows for imaging, so it's possible that these files are part of a legitimate operation.

If these events are isolated, they might not be a threat. However, the fact that all these files are being detected by the same rule and in the same directory might indicate a larger pattern. However, since all the files are associated with DISM and are .mui files, which are typically part of Windows, it's more likely that this is a false positive. \n\nWait, but why would the security system flag them as executable? Maybe the detection rule is too broad, or the files are being executed when they shouldn't be. However, without more context, like other events or processes, it's hard to tell.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All of them are related to the Dism.exe process, which is a legitimate Windows tool used for imaging and deployment. Each entry has a winlog task indicating \"File Executable Detected\" under the rule FileExecutableDetected. The files mentioned are all .dll files located in the Temp directory under a specific GUID folder.\n\nHmm, the fact that multiple .dll files are being detected by Dism.exe might be normal if they're part of a legitimate system update or deployment process. However, the Temp directory is often used by malware to store temporary files. But wait, Dism.exe is a trusted process, so maybe these files are part of a legitimate operation, like applying an update or a system image.\n\nBut why so many different provider DLLs? Let me think. Dism.exe might be using these DLLs as part of its normal functioning, especially if it's processing a Windows image. The GUID in the path suggests that this might be a temporary directory created during a specific operation, which could be legitimate. However, the repeated detection of executable files in the Temp folder could also be a red flag if these files are not supposed to be there.\n\nWait, the rule is \"FileExecutableDetected,\" which might be a custom rule. In some cases, security software flags any executable in the Temp directory as suspicious. But if Dism is a legitimate process and these DLLs are part of its normal operations, then this might not be malicious. However, if these DLLs are not standard and are being loaded by Dism.exe in an unusual way, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the filenames like SmiProvider.dll.mui, which are part of the Windows Imaging and Deployment Components. If these are standard system files, then it's okay. But if they're being generated in the Temp folder, that might be unusual. However, during deployment, temporary copies of such files might be created.\n\nI need to check if these DLLs are known legitimate files. For example, some of the providers like ImagingProvider.dll or IntlProvider.dll are part of the Windows Setup and Deployment tools. If they're being used by Dism.exe, that's normal. But if they're being loaded from a Temp directory, maybe that's a sign of tampering.\n\nBut the key here is that all the events are from Dism.exe, which is a trusted process. Unless there's a compromise where Dism.exe is being used to load malicious DLLs from the Temp directory, which would be a case of process hijacking. However, without additional context like the presence of other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn the absence of other indicators, this might just be a legitimate process using temporary files. However, the high number of detected files could be a sign of something unusual. But given that Dism is a trusted tool, I might lean towards this being a false positive or a legitimate operation. Still, it's worth investigating further to ensure that these DLLs are indeed legitimate and not being used for malicious purposes.\n<\/think>\n\nThe events described involve the **Dism.exe** process (a legitimate Windows tool for imaging and deployment) detecting multiple **DLL files** in a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B96D896D8`). Here's the analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **Process Legitimacy**:  \n   - **Dism.exe** is a trusted Windows utility used for tasks like applying updates, deploying operating systems, and managing Windows images. Its involvement is not inherently suspicious.\n\n2. **File Context**:  \n   - The detected files (e.g., `SmiProvider.dll`, `ImagingProvider.dll`, `IntlProvider.dll`) are **standard components** of Windows Imaging and Deployment tools. These are typically part of system updates or deployment workflows.\n\n3. **Temporary Directory Usage**:  \n   - The files are stored in a temporary directory (`%TEMP%\\...`), which is **common during system operations** (e.g., applying updates, extracting files for deployment). This is a normal behavior for tools like Dism.exe.\n\n4. **Rule \"FileExecutableDetected\"**:  \n   - If this is a custom or third-party security rule, it might flag **any executable in the Temp directory** as suspicious. However, **Dism.exe itself is legitimate**, and the files in question are standard system components.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns**\n- **Unusual Volume of Files**:  \n  The detection of **16+ DLLs** in a single temporary directory might be **unusual** for typical system operations. However, this could still be part of a **complex deployment or update process**.\n\n- **Lack of Malware Indicators**:  \n  There is **no direct evidence** of malware (e.g., hashes, network activity, anomalous process behavior). The events are **solely process-file interactions**.\n\n- **False Positives**:  \n  The rule \"FileExecutableDetected\" might be overly broad, flagging **legitimate system operations** as threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n**This is likely a legitimate system operation**. The Dism.exe process is interacting with temporary files as part of a **deployment or update task**. The files detected are **standard system components**, and their presence in the Temp directory is **normal during such operations**.\n\nHowever, **further investigation** is recommended if:\n- The system is not undergoing an expected deployment\/update.\n- The files are not recognized as legitimate system components.\n- Additional anomalies (e.g., unexpected network activity, unauthorized user access) are observed.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \n- Correlate with system logs (e.g., Event Viewer) to confirm if Dism.exe is running as part of a **planned system update** or deployment.\n- Verify the integrity of the detected files (e.g., via hash comparison with Microsoft's official repositories).\n- Adjust the \"FileExecutableDetected\" rule if it is generating excessive false positives."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. So, there are multiple entries here, all related to processes named Dism.exe and DismHost.exe. The first few entries show that Dism.exe is detecting various DLL files in the temporary directory. The paths all start with C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\, which seems like a unique temporary folder.\n\nThen there's an entry about DismHost.exe being created with a command line that includes a GUID. That might be a legitimate process, but the GUID could be part of a specific operation. Following that, several image load events for DismHost.exe show that it's loading various DLLs from the same temporary directory. The DLLs include things like DismCorePS.dll, DismProv.dll, OSProvider.dll, etc. \n\nNow, I need to determine if this is suspicious. Legitimate uses of Dism.exe and DismHost.exe are part of Windows Imaging and Deployment, often used during system setup or image deployment. However, the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from a temporary directory might be a red flag. Typically, system tools don't load a large number of DLLs from the Temp folder, especially if they're named in a way that's not standard. \n\nAlso, the presence of multiple File Executable Detected events for Dism.exe might indicate that the system's security software is flagging these files as potential threats. However, some of these DLLs could be legitimate if they're part of a legitimate deployment process. But the combination of multiple DLLs from the same temp directory, along with the image loads, might suggest that this is a malicious process trying to inject code or perform actions under the guise of a legitimate tool.\n\nAnother point is the use of the Temp directory. Malware often uses temporary directories to store files that are executed or loaded, as they are less likely to be scanned. The fact that the same GUID is in the path might be part of a specific malicious operation. \n\nBut I should also consider that during certain system operations, such as imaging or deployment, these files could be generated temporarily. However, the sheer number of DLLs being loaded and the fact that they're all from the same temp directory might be more indicative of a malicious activity. \n\nIn conclusion, while some of these processes are legitimate, the pattern here—multiple DLLs from a temp directory, the use of a GUID in the command line, and the number of image loads—raises suspicion. This could be a sign of a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one, hence the need to flag it as suspicious.\n<\/think>\n\nThe logs indicate a series of activities involving **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`**, which are legitimate Windows tools used for imaging and deployment. However, the **pattern of events** raises **suspicion** and warrants further investigation. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Multiple DLLs Loaded from Temp Directory:**\n   - **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`** are loading numerous DLLs (e.g., `DismCorePS.dll`, `OSProvider.dll`, `MsiProvider.dll`) from a temporary directory:  \n     `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\`.\n   - While **legitimate deployment tools** may use temporary directories, the **volume of DLLs** and their **non-standard naming** (e.g., `LogProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`) is unusual for typical system operations.\n\n2. **Suspicious Process Creation:**\n   - **`DismHost.exe`** is launched with a command line containing a **GUID** (`33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89`).  \n     - This could be **legitimate** (e.g., part of a deployment task), but **malware often uses GUIDs** to obfuscate operations or avoid detection.\n\n3. **File Executable Detected Events:**\n   - Multiple **`File Executable Detected`** alerts for **`Dism.exe`** loading DLLs from the temp folder.  \n     - This may indicate **security software flagging** these files as potential threats, possibly due to **unusual behavior** or **lack of digital signatures**.\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Clues:**\n   - No logs mention **user interaction**, **system updates**, or **legitimate deployment tasks** (e.g., imaging, sysprep), which would contextualize this activity.\n   - The **absence of logs** related to **Windows Update**, **group policy**, or **system configuration** makes the activity appear **isolated and unexplained**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This is Suspicious:**\n- **Malware often mimics legitimate tools** (e.g., `Dism.exe`) to evade detection.  \n- **Loading many DLLs from a temp directory** is a **common tactic** for malware to execute payloads or inject code.  \n- The **GUID in the command line** and **non-standard DLL names** may indicate **custom or obfuscated malware**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for Malware:**\n   - Run a full system scan using **reputable antivirus tools** (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes).\n   - Use **sandboxing** or **behavioral analysis** to monitor `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe` execution.\n\n2. **Investigate the Temp Directory:**\n   - Analyze the files in `C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\33BFE96B-A8C1-4275-97F0-CF4B69820D89\\` for **signs of tampering** (e.g., unusual file hashes, hidden attributes).\n\n3. **Review System Logs:**\n   - Check **Windows Event Viewer** for related events (e.g., **Windows Defender**, **Security Center**, **Application and Service Logs**) to confirm if this activity is flagged as malicious.\n\n4. **Verify Legitimacy:**\n   - Confirm if **`DismHost.exe`** was launched as part of a **legitimate deployment task** (e.g., sysprep, imaging). If not, this could be **malicious activity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile **`Dism.exe`** and **`DismHost.exe`** are legitimate, the **pattern of events** (multiple DLLs from a temp directory, use of a GUID, lack of context) **strongly suggests potential malicious activity**. This warrants **immediate investigation** to rule out malware or unauthorized access."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. So, there's a bunch of events related to DismHost.exe loading various DLL files from a temporary directory. The files all have names like IntlProvider.dll, IBSProvider.dll, etc. Then there's an event where DismHost.exe terminates, and after that, Dism.exe starts deleting some of those DLLs.\n\nHmm. First, I remember that DismHost.exe is part of the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM), which is used for Windows image management. Legitimate uses might involve loading providers for different tasks, like international settings or appx packages. But the fact that so many DLLs are being loaded from the Temp folder could be suspicious. Typically, system processes don't load a lot of DLLs from temporary directories unless they're part of a legitimate operation. However, the number here seems high. Let me count: there are 13 DLLs loaded before the process termination. That's a lot for a single process.\n\nThen, after the process terminates, Dism.exe deletes some of those DLLs. But why would Dism.exe delete them? If this were a legitimate operation, maybe the files are temporary and get cleaned up. However, the deletion is happening after the process has finished. Also, the fact that Dism.exe is involved in deleting the files might be part of the normal process. But I should check if the deleted files match the ones that were loaded. The logs show that AppxProvider.dll and AssocProvider.dll were deleted, which were also loaded. But others like IntlProvider.dll aren't mentioned as deleted. Maybe they were kept or not deleted yet.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the path: C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\... The Temp directory is a common place for malware to store temporary files. However, legitimate processes can also use it. But the large number of DLLs being loaded from there might indicate something unusual. Also, the fact that the same process (DismHost.exe) is loading these DLLs could be part of a normal operation, but the quantity is high.\n\nWait, DISM does use various providers, and each provider might be a separate DLL. For example, the AppxProvider is used for appx packages, and others might handle different aspects of image management. But even so, 13 different providers being loaded seems excessive. Maybe it's a legitimate operation, but the combination with the deletion of some files after termination could be a red flag. Also, the deletion by Dism.exe might be normal, but it's worth checking if the files being deleted are the same ones that were loaded. However, not all loaded files are deleted, which might be normal if some are needed afterward.\n\nBut I should also consider if this is a case of process injection or some kind of malicious activity. If an attacker is using DismHost.exe to load malicious DLLs from the Temp directory, that could be a sign of compromise. However, without more context like the hashes of the DLLs or network activity, it's hard to say for sure. The presence of multiple DLLs being loaded and then some being deleted might be part of a legitimate cleanup, but the high number of DLLs raises suspicion.\n\nIn security analysis, a high number of DLLs loaded from a temporary directory by a system process can be a sign of something unusual. It's not definitive proof of malware, but it's a potential indicator. The fact that Dism.exe is deleting some of them might be part of the process, but the lack of deletion for others could be a concern. Also, the termination of DismHost.exe followed by the deletion might be a way to clean up after the process, which could be normal or could be a tactic to avoid leaving traces.\n\nI think the key points here are the number of DLLs loaded from Temp, the involvement of Dism and DismHost, and the subsequent deletion. While DISM is a legitimate tool, the behavior described here might be part of a normal operation, but the high number of DLLs and the deletion could be suspicious. Without more information, it's a bit ambiguous, but the combination of these events would warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries indicate a sequence of events involving `DismHost.exe` and `Dism.exe` that warrant further investigation due to potential anomalies. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **High Volume of DLL Loads from Temp Directory**:\n   - `DismHost.exe` loads **13 distinct DLLs** (e.g., `IntlProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`, `TransmogProvider.dll`) from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). \n   - **Legitimacy**: DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing Windows images. It may load provider DLLs for tasks like internationalization, appx packages, or sysprep operations. However, **loading 13 DLLs** from a temporary directory is **unusual** and could indicate:\n     - **Malicious activity** (e.g., injection of malicious payloads via temporary files).\n     - **Misconfigured or corrupted DISM tools** (e.g., incomplete or tampered provider packages).\n\n2. **Process Termination and File Deletion**:\n   - After `DismHost.exe` terminates, `Dism.exe` deletes **some** of the loaded DLLs (e.g., `AppxProvider.dll`, `AssocProvider.dll`, `CbsProvider.dll`).\n   - **Legitimacy**: DISM may clean up temporary files post-operation. However, the **incomplete deletion** (not all DLLs are deleted) and the **timing** (deletion occurring after process termination) could be **normal** or **suspicious** depending on context.\n\n3. **Path and File Naming**:\n   - The temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) is a common target for **malware** to store transient files. While legitimate processes use this location, **loading multiple provider DLLs** from here raises concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n- **Unusual DLL Load Count**: 13 DLLs from a temporary directory by a system process is **outside the norm** for typical DISM operations.\n- **Selective File Deletion**: Only some DLLs are deleted, which may suggest **incomplete cleanup** or **intentional retention** of files (e.g., for persistence or further exploitation).\n- **Lack of Contextual Clues**: No additional metadata (e.g., file hashes, network activity, parent process details) is provided to confirm legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. **Check File Integrity**:\n   - Verify the **hashes** of the deleted and remaining DLLs to ensure they match known legitimate DISM provider files. Mismatched hashes could indicate tampering.\n\n2. **Monitor for Anomalies**:\n   - Investigate if this behavior is **isolated** or part of a recurring pattern. Use tools like **Process Monitor** or **SIEM** to track file access and process interactions.\n\n3. **Review System Logs and Network Activity**:\n   - Look for **unusual network connections**, **unauthorized access**, or **other system changes** around the time of the event.\n\n4. **Update and Patch**:\n   - Ensure the system is up-to-date with **Windows updates** to mitigate risks from known vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the behavior could be part of a **legitimate DISM operation**, the **high volume of DLLs loaded from a temporary directory** and **incomplete cleanup** are **red flags** that require further investigation. This pattern is consistent with **malicious activity** (e.g., process injection or payload delivery) but cannot be confirmed without additional evidence. **Immediate forensic analysis** is recommended to rule out compromise. \n\n**Verdict**: **Suspicious – Further Investigation Required**."}

The fact that multiple files are being deleted from the Temp folder might be part of a normal cleanup process. However, the presence of both file deletions and a file creation time change could indicate something more. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if this batch is interesting for investigation. The key here is whether these actions are suspicious. Since all the files are in the Temp directory and the process is Dism.exe, which is legitimate, this might be a normal operation. However, sometimes attackers might abuse legitimate processes. But in this case, the actions are all deletions from Temp, which is common during system updates or installations.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern that suggests malicious activity. The files being deleted are various DLLs and MUI files, which are part of the deployment tools. The fact that they're in the Temp folder suggests they were temporary files created during a process.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, all from the Dism.exe process, each indicating that a file was deleted. The files are all in the Temp directory under a specific GUID path, and they have .mui extensions. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Dism.exe does. Dism is the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool, used for managing Windows images. It's commonly used for tasks like mounting WIM files, applying updates, and configuring images. So, deleting files during such operations might be normal, especially if they're temporary files or part of a cleanup process.\n\nBut why so many files being deleted? The files mentioned are all .mui files, which are resource files for different languages. They might be part of the image being processed. However, the fact that they're all being deleted by Dism.exe could be a red flag if they're not supposed to be deleted. But I should check if this is typical behavior.\n\nLooking at the paths, they're all in the Temp folder, which is common for temporary files. If Dism is running a cleanup or uninstalling components, deleting these files might be normal. However, if these files are part of a legitimate process, it's not suspicious. But if the user is not aware of this activity, it might be worth investigating.\n\nAnother angle: are there any signs of malicious activity? The process is Dism.exe, which is a legitimate system tool. However, if an attacker has compromised the system and is using Dism to delete files, that could be part of a larger attack. But without additional events, like unexpected processes or network activity, it's hard to tell. The logs here only show file deletions by a legitimate process.\n\nThe key here is that the classification is about whether the batch is interesting for investigation. Since all events are from a legitimate process performing what seems like normal operations (deleting temporary files), but the volume and the specific nature of the files might be unusual. However, without more context or anomalies, it's not clear if this is malicious. \n\nBut the user might be concerned about why so many files are being deleted. However, considering that Dism is involved and the files are in Temp, it's possible that this is part of a routine operation. Therefore, the answer might be that it's not necessarily suspicious, but it could be worth checking if the Dism process is legitimate and if there are other signs of compromise.\n<\/think>\n\nThe provided log entries indicate that the **`Dism.exe`** process (a legitimate Windows tool for managing Windows images) has deleted multiple `.mui` files (language resource files) from the **`AppData\\Local\\Temp`** directory.

It is known to modify or delete files during system configuration tasks.\n\n2. **File Location and Naming**:  \n   - The deleted files are in the `%TEMP%` directory, a common location for temporary files during system operations.  \n   - File names (e.g., `FfuProvider.dll`, `SysprepProvider.dll`) suggest they are part of Windows deployment or imaging components, which `Dism.exe` might interact with.\n\n3. **Context of Deletion**:  \n   - If this activity occurs during a **legitimate system deployment, cleanup, or imaging process**, the deletions are likely **expected behavior** (e.g., removing temporary or obsolete providers).  \n   - However, **no explicit context** (e.g., recent deployment, sysprep, or imaging activity) is provided in the logs, which could be a red flag.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns:**\n- **Lack of Context**:  \n  The logs do not indicate whether this deletion is part of a known legitimate process (e.g., a sysprep or image deployment). Without additional context (e.g., event logs, user activity, or system state), it is difficult to confirm if this is normal.\n\n- **Abnormal Volume of Deletions**:  \n  While `Dism.exe` may delete files during operations, the **large number of deletions** (16 files) could be unusual unless explicitly tied to a specific task.\n\n- **No Corresponding Installation\/Deployment Logs**:  \n  If these deletions are not accompanied by logs of installation or deployment activities, it might suggest an **unusual or unintended process**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. **Check for System Deployment Activity**:  \n   - Verify if the system recently underwent imaging, sysprep, or deployment operations. This would justify the deletions.\n\n2. **Review Full System Logs**:  \n   - Correlate these events with other logs (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, Security logs) to determine if this is part of a legitimate process or if there are signs of tampering.\n\n3. **Monitor for Anomalies**:  \n   - If this occurs outside of a known deployment window, investigate further for signs of **malware or unauthorized activity** (e.g., unexpected process behavior, unusual network activity).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhile the deletions by `Dism.exe` could be **legitimate** (e.g., during system imaging), the **absence of contextual evidence** (e.g., deployment activity logs) raises **moderate concern**. Further investigation into the system's recent activity and correlation with other logs is recommended to confirm whether this is normal behavior or an indicator of compromise. \n\n**Classification**: **Suspicious (Insufficient Context)** – Requires further analysis."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries from Windows Event Logs, probably from a security monitoring system like Microsoft Defender or something similar. The main thing I notice is that there's a PowerShell command being executed multiple times, specifically creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to \"tarefa_logico.exe\" in a directory that doesn't look like a standard Windows path. That seems suspicious.\n\nFirst, I should check if creating a new service through PowerShell is a normal activity. Usually, services are managed through the Services MMC snap-in or using commands like sc.exe, but using PowerShell's New-Service cmdlet isn't unheard of. However, the fact that the binary path is in \"C:\\unidade_logico\\\" which isn't a standard Windows directory might be a red flag. That directory name translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese, which is a bit odd and could be a hint that this is a custom or non-standard location.\n\nThen there's the repetition of the same command line multiple times. That might indicate that the script is being run in a loop or that there's an attempt to persist the service creation. Also, the service is named \"objeto_ativo\" which is Portuguese for \"active object,\" which again seems a bit out of place for a standard service name.\n\nThe other logs mention processes like services.exe, sppsvc.exe, svchost.exe, which are legitimate Windows processes. However, the presence of the PowerShell command line multiple times with the same content could be part of an attack chain where an attacker is trying to establish persistence by creating a new service that runs their malicious executable.\n\nLooking at the file path \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\", the structure seems to be a bit more organized, which might be a sign of a custom application, but the location is not typical for system services. Also, the name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" translates to \"logical task.exe,\" which again is not a standard Windows service.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the logs include \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" tasks. These might be related to the event logging system itself, but the repetition of the same PowerShell command line could indicate that the system is being probed or that there's an ongoing attempt to execute malicious code.\n\nI should also consider if the user is asking for an analysis of these logs. They might be concerned about potential security threats, such as unauthorized service creation, execution of unknown binaries, or attempts to persist on the system. The key points here are the non-standard service name, the unusual file path, and the repeated execution of the same PowerShell command.\n\nPossible steps to take would be to check if \"tarefa_logico.exe\" exists in the specified location and verify its legitimacy. Also, checking the service details for \"objeto_ativo\" to see if it's a known service or if it's been added without user consent. Additionally, reviewing the PowerShell execution policy, as the command includes \"-ExecutionPolicy Restricted,\" which might be a way to bypass certain restrictions, though that's a bit confusing because Restricted is the default policy that prevents scripts from running.\n\nAnother angle is that the attacker might be using PowerShell to create a service that runs their malicious payload, which could be part of a larger attack, like data exfiltration or establishing a backdoor. The repetition of the command could be an attempt to ensure the service is created even if the initial execution fails, or it might be part of a script that's being run multiple times for some reason.\n\nIn summary, the main concerns here are the creation of a new service with an unusual name and path, the repetition of the same command, and the potential for the service to execute a non-standard executable. These are indicators of possible malicious activity, and further investigation would be needed to confirm if this is a legitimate action or an attack.\n<\/think>\n\nThe log entries you've provided indicate potential **malicious activity** on a Windows system, specifically involving **PowerShell** and **service creation**. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity**\n1. **Unusual Service Creation via PowerShell**:\n   - A new service named **`objeto_ativo`** (Portuguese for \"active object\") is being created using the `New-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell.\n   - The service's binary path points to a non-standard location:  \n     ```\n     C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe\n     ```\n     - **`unidade_logico`** (Portuguese for \"logical unit\") and **`tarefa_logico.exe`** (\"logical task.exe\") are not typical Windows service names or paths.\n     - This could indicate an **unauthorized or malicious service** being installed.\n\n2. **Persistence Attempt**:\n   - The PowerShell command is **repeated multiple times** in the logs, suggesting an attempt to **persist the service** or ensure its creation even if initial execution fails.\n   - This is a common tactic in **malware campaigns** to maintain access to a system.\n\n3. **Non-Standard File Paths**:\n   - The path `C:\\unidade_logico\\...` is **not a standard Windows directory** for system services. Legitimate services are typically located in:\n     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` (for binaries)\n     - `C:\\Program Files\\` (for applications)\n   - This raises concerns about the **origin and legitimacy** of the executable file (`tarefa_logico.exe`).\n\n4. **Repetition of the Same Command**:\n   - The exact same PowerShell command is logged multiple times, which could indicate:\n     - A **scripted attack** (e.g., a loop or retry mechanism).\n     - **Automated exploitation** (e.g., a worm or botnet).\n     - **False positives** (if the logs are misconfigured), but this is less likely given the context.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Execution**:\n   - The service **`objeto_ativo`** could be used to execute **malicious code** (e.g., a backdoor, data exfiltration tool, or ransomware).\n   - The executable `tarefa_logico.exe` should be **verified for legitimacy** (e.g., via file hashing, digital signatures, or sandboxing).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Actions**\n1. **Verify the Executable**:\n   - Check if `C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe` exists.\n   - Analyze the file using tools like:\n     - **VirusTotal** (for malware detection).\n     - **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes** (for scanning).\n     - **Hash lookup** (e.g., using [AlienVault OTX](https:\/\/otx.alienvault.com\/)).\n\n2. **Investigate the Service**:\n   - Use **`sc.exe`** or **`Get-Service`** in PowerShell to check details of the `objeto_ativo` service:\n     ```powershell\n     Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter \"Name='objeto_ativo'\"\n     ```\n   - Look for:\n     - **Service description** (should be meaningful if legitimate).\n     - **Start name** (should be a valid user account, not `SYSTEM` or `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`).\n     - **Binary path** (should match a known, trusted executable).\n\n3. **Check PowerShell Execution Policy**:\n   - The command includes `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which is the **default policy** that prevents script execution.\n   - If the script is running despite this, it may indicate a **bypass** (e.g., using `Bypass` or `RemoteSigned` policy, or exploitation of a vulnerability).\n\n4. **Review System Logs for Additional Clues**:\n   - Look for **failed login attempts**, **unusual network activity**, or **process creation events** (e.g., Event ID 4688) related to `tarefa_logico.exe`.\n\n5. **Isolate the System (if necessary)**:\n   - If the file is confirmed malicious, **isolate the system** from the network and perform a **full system scan**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe logs strongly suggest **suspicious activity**, including the creation of a non-standard service and the repeated execution of a PowerShell command pointing to an unusual executable. This could be part of a **malware installation**, **persistence mechanism**, or **remote access attempt**. Immediate investigation and verification of the involved files and services are critical to mitigate potential risks."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143623.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. So, the user provided a bunch of JSON lines, each representing a system event. My job is to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the entries. Most of them are about PowerShell commands being executed with the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. The commands vary a bit. Some are simple like Write-Host 'Final result: 1', which seems harmless. But then there are others that are more complex. \n\nLooking at the more complex ones, there's a PowerShell script that's checking INF files in the Windows directory. The script is searching for specific patterns in those INF files, like [defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]. The purpose here might be to detect if there are any default installation sections for different architectures. But why would that be suspicious?\n\nWell, INF files are used in Windows for installing drivers and other software. If an attacker is looking through these files, maybe they're trying to find vulnerabilities or ways to inject malicious code. However, the script itself isn't doing anything malicious—it's just reading and checking the content. But the fact that it's scanning through system files might be unusual, especially if it's done repeatedly.\n\nNow, considering the repetition. There are multiple entries with the same command lines. The same PowerShell script is executed several times. That could indicate that the process is being monitored or that there's a loop checking the same thing over and over. However, without more context, like other events or file changes, it's hard to tell if this is a red flag.\n\nThe winlog tasks are either 'Provider Lifecycle' or 'Engine Lifecycle'. I'm not entirely sure what those tasks mean, but they might relate to system components or services. If these tasks are normal, then the events might not be significant. However, if they're associated with unexpected processes, that's a problem.\n\nAnother point is the ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted. Normally, PowerShell's Restricted mode doesn't allow scripts to run, but the commands here are using -ExecutionPolicy Restricted, which might be a way to bypass that. Wait, actually, if the policy is set to Restricted, then scripts can't run unless they're signed or come from a trusted location. But the user is running a command that's allowed under Restricted, like Write-Host. So maybe that's not an issue here.\n\nPutting it all together: the majority of events are benign, but there's a recurring pattern of scanning INF files, which might be part of a larger process. However, without evidence of malicious activity like file modifications, network connections, or unauthorized access, it's hard to classify this as definitely interesting. The repetition might be normal, like part of a diagnostic tool or a script that's running periodically. \n\nBut considering cybersecurity best practices, any unusual activity in system directories, especially involving scripting, should be investigated. The fact that the same command is repeated multiple times might indicate a script that's being run in a loop, which could be a sign of something trying to probe the system. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the classification here is on the edge. It's not clearly malicious, but there are enough unusual elements (repeated scans of INF files, same command lines) to warrant further investigation. So, I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. The justification would be the repeated scanning of system files and the use of PowerShell in a way that might be probing for vulnerabilities.\n<\/think>\n\n**Classification:** INTERESTING  \n**Confidence:** 0.7 (moderate)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe batch contains repeated executions of PowerShell commands with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which typically blocks untrusted scripts. However, the recurring commands involve scanning Windows INF files (`C:\\Windows\\...`) for architecture-specific installation sections (`[defaultinstall.nt(...)]`). While the scripts themselves are not inherently malicious (e.g., `Write-Host` is benign), the **repetition** and **focus on system-critical files** raise concerns.  \n\n- **Unusual Behavior:** Scanning INF files in the Windows directory is not typical for standard system processes. INF files are used for driver\/software installation, and probing them could indicate attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or inject malicious payloads.  \n- **Repetition:** The same script is executed multiple times across different `winlog` tasks (`Provider Lifecycle`, `Engine Lifecycle`), suggesting a potential loop or diagnostic tool. While not definitively malicious, this could signal a probing activity.  \n- **Contextual Ambiguity:** Without additional evidence (e.g., file modifications, network activity, or unauthorized access), the behavior is ambiguous but warrants further investigation due to its deviation from normal system operations.  \n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor for follow-up activities (e.g., file changes, network connections) and analyze the source of the PowerShell commands to confirm benignity."}
