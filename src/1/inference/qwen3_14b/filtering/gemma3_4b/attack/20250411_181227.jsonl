So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there are multiple instances where the task is 'Execute a Remote Command' with process and file as None. That might be normal or part of some automated system, but repeated entries could indicate something. But I need to check more.\n\nThen, there's an entry with a process that's a PowerShell command. The command line shows creating a scheduled task with 'calc.exe' and setting the principal to Administrators with highest privileges. That's a red flag. Creating a scheduled task with admin rights could be an attempt to escalate privileges or persist on the system.\n\nNext, there's a WmiPrvSE.exe process loading taskschd.dll. That's part of Windows' Task Scheduler, but if it's loading from System32, maybe that's normal. However, combined with other events, it might be part of a larger attack.\n\nThen, svchost.exe is setting registry values multiple times. svchost is a common host process for Windows services, but frequent registry changes could indicate tampering. Also, a file is created in the Tasks directory called 'unidade_comum', which might be a scheduled task being created.\n\nAnother PowerShell process creates a file in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for malware to store data, but not always malicious. However, when combined with the scheduled task creation, it might be part of an attack.\n\nChrome.exe is loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded in an unusual context, it might be bypassing security software. However, Chrome is a normal application, so maybe that's just regular activity.\n\nThere's also a winlogbeat.exe creating a YAML file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the presence of multiple events could be part of setup or attack.\n\nPutting it all together: The key suspicious points are the PowerShell command creating a scheduled task with admin rights, the creation of the 'unidade_comum' task, and the multiple registry changes by svchost. These could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges. Even though some entries are normal, the combination of these events suggests potential malicious activity. However, there's not enough information to be certain, so the confidence is moderate.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple events indicate potential malicious activity: PowerShell creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges, svchost.exe modifying registry values repeatedly, and creation of a suspicious scheduled task file 'unidade_comum'.

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting or not. Let's see.\n\nFirst, looking at the logs, most of them are about chrome.exe performing registry value sets. There are eight entries like that. Then there's one about a DNS query from chrome.exe, and two other entries: one for winlogbeat.exe creating a file and another for powershell.exe creating a file.\n\nHmm. Chrome doing registry changes multiple times might be normal, but maybe not. However, if it's the same process doing the same thing repeatedly, that could be a sign of something. But wait, the DNS query is also from chrome.exe. Maybe that's part of normal browsing, but maybe not. \n\nThen there's the file creation by winlogbeat.exe. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a configuration file might be normal. The path is in the Downloads folder, which is common for such files. The other file created by powershell.exe is in the same user's Downloads directory as well. But creating a text file with powershell might be benign, like a user saving a file. \n\nBut wait, why are there so many registry changes from chrome.exe? Maybe it's a legitimate action if the user is modifying settings, but if it's done by an attacker, maybe they're changing registry keys to persist or modify behavior. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being changed or other suspicious activities, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe presence of multiple registry events might be a red flag, but if they're all from chrome.exe, maybe it's just normal operation. However, the DNS query could be part of a phishing attack or communication with a malicious server. But again, without knowing the domain being queried, it's hard to say. \n\nThe other two events are file creations. Winlogbeat creating a .yml.new file is likely part of its normal operation when setting up configurations. The powershell-created file is a text file, which is common. Unless the file contains malicious content, but the log doesn't show that. \n\nPutting it all together: The majority of events are from chrome.exe doing registry changes. While that could be suspicious, it's not definitive. The other events don't seem too bad. However, the repetition of registry changes might indicate something. But maybe the user is just doing normal stuff. \n\nI think the justification here is that the batch has multiple registry changes from chrome.exe, which could be normal, but without more info, it's not a clear indicator of malicious activity. The other events are benign. So maybe it's not interesting. But I'm a bit unsure because repeated registry changes can be a sign of persistence. However, the confidence isn't super high because there's no clear evidence of malicious intent here. So I'll go with \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a confidence around 0.4. It's a bit of a toss-up, but without more data, it's hard to be certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Most events involve legitimate chrome.exe registry modifications and benign file creation by winlogbeat.exe\/powershell.exe. No clear indicators of compromise or suspicious patterns detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.4\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: they're all about PowerShell.exe loading image files. The paths point to .NET Framework DLLs like clr.dll and clrjit.dll. Those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...ps1. That seems like a script file. Then, the same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp might be part of normal operations, but sometimes attackers use Temp directories to execute malicious scripts.\n\nNext, there's a pipe created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, but if it's unexpected, it might be a red flag. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's a PowerShell command line that's pretty suspicious. The command is using ScheduledTask to create a task that runs calc.exe, which is a common test application. But the user here is setting the principal to Administrators group with highest privileges. That's a bit concerning because it's granting high-level permissions. The command is using the ScheduledTask module, which is a legitimate tool, but the way it's being used here might be part of an attempt to escalate privileges or execute code with admin rights.\n\nThen there are multiple entries about Chrome.exe setting registry values. If Chrome is modifying registry keys, that could be normal if it's updating its own settings, but if it's doing it in a way that's not typical, it might be a sign of something else. However, without more context on which registry keys are being modified, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are several events where the process is None, and the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\". That's a red flag. If there are multiple instances of executing remote commands without a clear process, that could indicate a potential compromise. However, the process being None might be an error in the log or an indicator that the event is from a source that didn't capture the process information properly. But if those events are legitimate, they could be part of a remote management tool, but if not, they might be malicious.\n\nPutting it all together: The PowerShell events include creating a scheduled task with admin privileges, which could be a sign of privilege escalation. The creation and deletion of a script in Temp might be part of an attack chain. The remote command executions without a process might be suspicious. However, some of these events could be legitimate, like normal system operations or user activities. But the combination of creating a scheduled task with high privileges and multiple remote command executions without a clear process might indicate a potential security incident. The confidence here is a bit moderate because while there are suspicious elements, they might not be conclusive on their own. However, the presence of both the scheduled task setup and the remote command executions raises enough flags to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve loading legitimate .NET DLLs, creating\/deleting a temporary script file, and attempting to register a high-privilege scheduled task (running calc.exe as Administrators).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181227.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of JSONL entries, each representing a system event. My job is to analyze all of them together and decide if this batch is interesting for investigation. The answer needs to be in a specific JSON format with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are related to PowerShell processes. The command lines in the process entries are similar. They all seem to be creating scheduled tasks using PowerShell commands. Let me check the command lines more closely.\n\nLooking at the first entry, the command_line is using PowerShell to create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe, which is a harmless calculator program. But the trigger is set to run at logon, and the principal is set to BUILTIN\\Administrators with the highest run level. That's a bit suspicious because running tasks with admin privileges can be a red flag. Also, the task names are things like \"unidade_ativo$object\" and \"tarefa_base$object\". The use of $object in the task name might be a typo or part of the script, but it's odd.\n\nWait, the command_line is using Register-ScheduledTask with the task name being something like \"unidade_ativo$object\". But in PowerShell, when you create a scheduled task, the name should be a string. The $object variable here is part of the script, which might be a mistake. However, the main thing is that these tasks are being created with high privileges and set to run calc.exe on logon. But why would someone create a scheduled task that runs calc.exe? That's unusual because calc.exe is typically not used for malicious purposes, but it's often used in examples or as a test. However, in a real attack scenario, attackers might use it as a payload or to test if the task is working.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are multiple entries with similar command lines, each creating different scheduled tasks with different names. This repetition might indicate an automated script or a pattern. Also, there are several entries where PowerShell is accessing the registry or processes, which could be part of persistence mechanisms. For example, the 'Registry value set' events might indicate changes to the registry to maintain access or modify system settings.\n\nLooking at the 'Image loaded' events, they mention mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll, which are related to .NET Framework. Loading these DLLs might be normal, but if they're being loaded in an unexpected context, it could be a sign of something malicious. However, in this case, the events are just reporting that these DLLs were loaded by PowerShell, which could be part of legitimate .NET operations.\n\nNow, considering all these events together: multiple scheduled tasks created with admin rights, running calc.exe on logon, PowerShell interacting with the registry, and loading .NET DLLs. While calc.exe itself isn't inherently malicious, the combination of creating multiple scheduled tasks with high privileges and the use of PowerShell for automation could be a sign of an attacker trying to establish persistence on the system. The repetition of similar commands suggests a possible automated attack or script deployment.\n\nHowever, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity beyond the scheduled tasks. The justification for classification would hinge on whether these actions are suspicious. Since creating scheduled tasks with admin rights is a common technique for persistence, and the fact that it's done multiple times with similar commands, this might be worthy of investigation. The confidence level would be moderate because while the actions are suspicious, they might also be part of a legitimate process if someone is testing or configuring tasks. But without more context, the suspicious nature of the events warrants further look into.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes are creating scheduled tasks with high privileges (BUILTIN\\\\Administrators, RunLevel Highest) that execute calc.exe on user logon. This pattern suggests potential persistence mechanism attempts, as calc.exe is often used as a test payload in malicious contexts.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
