{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if it's interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: multiple chrome.exe processes doing DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser, so probably not an issue. But then there's a cmd.exe running a command to create a notepad.exe process. That seems a bit odd because using wmic to start notepad is unusual. Maybe a red flag here.\n\nNext, there are several instances of WMIC.exe loading DLLs like urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and some Windows Defender DLLs. Loading these might be normal, but if it's from an unexpected source or in a suspicious context, it could be malicious. However, the paths here are standard system directories, so maybe legitimate.\n\nThen there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be part of its normal operation. But the fact that it's creating a .yml.new file could be part of a configuration update, which is normal. However, if this is unexpected, it might be worth checking.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: chrome, cmd, powershell, WMIC, notepad, svchost. Some of these are common, but the use of WMIC and the command line in cmd.exe might be suspicious. Also, the multiple registry value sets by different processes could indicate some level of system modification, but again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThe presence of 'Special Logon' event might indicate a non-standard login, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the svchost.exe loading urlmon.dll is normal, as svchost hosts various system services.\n\nPutting it all together: The most suspicious parts are the cmd.exe using wmic to create notepad.exe and the multiple image loads by WMIC. However, these could be part of legitimate activities. The confidence here is moderate because while there are some unusual events, they might not be definitively malicious. The file creation by winlogbeat seems normal. So I'd classify this as interesting but not highly suspicious. Maybe 0.6 confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: 1) cmd.exe executing WMIC to spawn notepad.exe (unusual process creation), 2) WMIC.exe loading DLLs from system directories (potential malicious code injection), 3) winlogbeat.exe creating configuration files in user downloads directory (potential configuration tampering). While some events are legitimate, the combination raises security concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180856.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these events to determine if they're interesting for investigation. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there's a powershell.exe process with a ProcessAccess event. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so that's a red flag. Then, calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Calculator is a normal process, but loading a system DLL might be okay. However, urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so maybe that's normal. \n\nNext, several svchost.exe entries with Registry value set events. Svchost is a common host process for Windows services, and registry changes could be normal, but if there are multiple entries, maybe something's going on. The same svchost.exe entries repeat, which might not be significant on their own. \n\nThen, Calculator.exe again loading urlmon.dll. Wait, the name is slightly different: \"Calculator.exe\" versus \"calc.exe\". Maybe that's a typo or a different process? But the path is the same system file. Not sure yet. \n\nAnother powershell.exe ProcessAccess event. The user ran whoami.exe, which is a legitimate command to check user context. But if it's done in a suspicious way, maybe. However, the command line here seems normal. \n\nLooking at the logs again, there are multiple instances of svchost.exe modifying the registry. That could be part of normal system operations, but if it's happening frequently or in combination with other events, it might indicate something. \n\nThe special logon event and a process being None might be a user logging in, which is normal. But combined with other events, maybe. \n\nPutting it all together: there are multiple PowerShell accesses, which are often used in attacks. The svchost.exe registry changes might be normal, but the repetition could be a sign. However, without more context like unusual command lines, network activity, or other anomalies, it's hard to say. The justification might be that PowerShell is used here, but unless there's a clear malicious action, it might not be enough. \n\nWait, the user also ran whoami.exe, which is normal. The other events are standard system processes. Maybe this is just normal system activity. But the repetition of svchost.exe registry events and multiple PowerShell accesses could be worth looking into. However, the confidence might be low because there's no clear evidence of malicious behavior yet. So the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no direct indication of a threat, just common processes and events.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events show common system processes (powershell.exe, svchost.exe, calc.exe) with standard activities (registry access, image loading). No clear indicators of compromise, malicious command lines, or anomalous behavior detected in the batch.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.3\n}"}
