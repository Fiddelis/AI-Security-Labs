The first event has a process command line with PowerShell creating a new PSDrive named 'g' pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That seems suspicious because creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share might be part of lateral movement or accessing sensitive files. The task here is 'Engine Lifecycle', which doesn't immediately ring a bell as malicious, but the command itself is noteworthy.\n\nThen there are 20 subsequent events, all with the task 'Execute a Remote Command', but the process and file fields are None. That's odd. Typically, if a command is being executed remotely, there should be some process information. The absence of process details might indicate that the logs are incomplete or that the events are being generated by a different component that doesn't capture process details. However, multiple instances of 'Execute a Remote Command' could be part of a legitimate process, like a remote management tool. But combined with the first event, it might suggest that someone is trying to execute commands on a remote system after establishing a connection via the PSDrive.\n\nThe key here is the combination of creating a PSDrive to a remote machine and then executing multiple remote commands. This pattern could indicate an attacker gaining access to a system and then moving laterally or executing commands on other machines. However, without more context, like user information, IP addresses, or additional process details, it's hard to be certain. The confidence is moderately high because the first event is suspicious, but the rest are ambiguous. So, I'd classify this as interesting but with a confidence around 0.7.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"The first event shows PowerShell creating a PSDrive to a remote machine's C$ share (likely lateral movement), followed by 20 'Execute a Remote Command' events (potential command execution on remote systems).

Not sure yet, but the next few entries are all about powershell.exe executing a command that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The command line is the same in multiple entries, which might indicate repeated attempts or a persistent process.\n\nLooking at the URLs, the script is from raw.githubusercontent.com, which is a common place for hosting code, but the specific repo name \"WinPwn\" and the username \"S3cur3Th1sSh1t\" seem suspicious. That could be a red flag, as sometimes malicious scripts are hosted there. The script name \"WinPwn.ps1\" might be a known malicious script or part of a tool used for attacks.\n\nThen there are multiple entries with the command_line involving \"New-PSDrive\" to map a network drive to \\\\Target\\\\C$. This is often used in penetration testing or malicious activities to access remote systems. The repetition of these commands across multiple log entries suggests that this might be part of an ongoing attack or a script that's being executed multiple times, possibly to establish persistence or access sensitive files.\n\nThe winlog tasks are mostly \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which might relate to PowerShell providers or engines handling the commands. The fact that there are several entries with the same command_line could indicate that the script is being run repeatedly, which is unusual and might be part of an exploit or data exfiltration attempt.\n\nAlso, the use of \"iex\" (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script is a common technique in PowerShell-based attacks. This is often seen in malicious activities because it allows the execution of arbitrary code from a string, which can be dangerous if the source isn't trusted.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of downloading a script from a suspicious GitHub repo, using PowerShell to execute it, and mapping network drives suggests potential malicious activity. The repetition of the same command across multiple logs increases the likelihood that this is not a benign activity. Therefore, this batch of events is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute a malicious script from a GitHub URL (WinPwn.ps1) and map network drives to \\\\Target\\\\C$, indicating potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.95\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity around PowerShell.exe. That's a common tool for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The first event mentions a registry value set, which might be normal, but combined with other events could be suspicious.\n\nThen there's a whoami.exe process, which is usually used to check the current user. Not inherently malicious, but when paired with PowerShell, it might be part of a larger sequence.\n\nThe key event here is the PowerShell process with a command line that downloads a script from a GitHub URL. The URL is part of a repository named \"WinPwn,\" which I recognize as a known malicious payload. The command uses the WebClient class to download and execute a PowerShell script, which is a common technique in malware. The presence of this command line is a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple image loads related to .NET framework DLLs and Windows Defender components. While loading these DLLs isn't suspicious on its own, the combination with the malicious download and execution is concerning. The script is being downloaded to a temporary directory and then deleted, which is a tactic used to avoid leaving traces.\n\nThe events also include file creation and deletion in the Temp directory, which is typical for malicious scripts to execute and then clean up. The use of the -noninteractive and -consoleoutput flags might be part of bypassing execution policies.\n\nOther events like registry value sets and process accesses are common in both legitimate and malicious scenarios, but when combined with the PowerShell download and execution, they form a pattern that's indicative of an attack. The presence of svchost.exe modifying the registry could be part of persistence mechanisms, but without more context, it's harder to say. However, the main red flag here is the PowerShell command downloading the WinPwn.ps1 script.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the batch of events shows a clear attempt to download and execute a malicious script, which is a significant security threat. Therefore, this batch is definitely interesting for investigation with high confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing suspicious commands, including downloading a script from a GitHub repository associated with malicious activity (WinPwn.ps1).

{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250606_143816.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries related to 'sppsvc.exe', which is a legitimate Windows process related to software protection. However, there's also a lot of activity from 'powershell.exe'. \n\nLooking at the 'sppsvc.exe' events, one of them mentions loading 'taskschd.dll' from the System32 directory. That's a normal system file, so maybe nothing suspicious there. Another event is the creation of a file in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\store\\2.0\\cache\\cache.dat'. I know that the 'spp' directory is part of the Software Protection Platform, so creating a cache file there might be normal, but I should check if there's any unusual activity.\n\nNow, the majority of the events are from PowerShell. There's a 'Process Create' event with a command line that includes 'New-PSDrive' to map a network drive. That's a common administrative task, but the fact that it's being done here might be part of a larger operation. Then there are several 'ImageLoaded' events for various .NET assemblies and Windows Defender components. Loading these DLLs is normal for PowerShell, but I need to check if there's any unexpected loading.\n\nOne of the PowerShell events has a 'File created' in the user's Temp directory with a filename that looks like a script: '__PSScriptPolicyTest_ppfs3is3.jnx.ps1'. Then, almost immediately after, there's a 'File Delete' event for the same file. Creating and deleting a script in the Temp directory could be part of a legitimate test, but sometimes attackers do this to execute malicious scripts temporarily. However, the fact that it's deleted right after might be an attempt to cover tracks.\n\nAnother thing to note is the use of 'whoami.exe', which is a standard tool for checking user context. But combined with other PowerShell activities, it might be part of reconnaissance.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. While some activities are normal, the combination of creating a temporary script file and deleting it, along with multiple PowerShell events and loading various DLLs, could indicate either legitimate activity or a potential security incident. However, without more context or signs of malicious payloads or unexpected network activity, it's hard to be certain. The presence of 'sppsvc.exe' events might be normal, but the PowerShell activities are more concerning. I'd lean towards 'INTERESTING' but with moderate confidence because the actions are not definitively malicious but warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events include file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, potential script execution, and loading of .NET assemblies.
