The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the processes involved. There are several instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe being created. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, so that's a red flag. Then there's the sc.exe process, which is used to manage Windows services. The command line for sc.exe shows creating a service with a binPath that includes running a script. The script paths mentioned, like c:\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1 and c:\\componente_base_NonExistingScript.ps1, don't exist (since they're named NonExistingScript), which might be a sign that the attacker is trying to execute a non-existent script, possibly to trigger an error or as part of a larger plan.\n\nLooking at the cmd.exe command line, there's a line that uses sc create to set up a service with a command that starts a PowerShell script. Even though the script isn't found, the attempt to create a service with such a command is suspicious. Creating a service that runs a script isn't typical for normal operations. Also, the use of 'sc qc win32times' to query the service configuration after creation might be checking if the service was set up correctly.\n\nThere are multiple events related to Registry value sets, which could indicate changes to system settings or attempts to modify registry keys for persistence. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if they're malicious. The services.exe and svchost.exe processes are standard system processes, so their registry activity might be normal unless there's an unusual pattern.\n\nThe ImageLoad events for urlmon.dll in calc.exe and Calculator.exe are normal since urlmon.dll is a legitimate Windows component. The winlogbeat.exe event is about creating a file, which might be part of log collection, but the path is in the user's Downloads directory, which could be a sign of user-initiated activity, though not necessarily malicious.\n\nPutting it all together, the key suspicious points are the attempts to create a service with a non-existent PowerShell script and the multiple process creations involving PowerShell and cmd.exe. These could be part of an attack where the attacker is trying to execute scripts or set up persistence. However, there's no direct evidence of a successful attack, just the attempts. The confidence isn't 100% because some activities could be benign, but the combination of these events does warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: PowerShell and cmd.exe process creation with registry modifications, attempts to create a service with non-existent script paths (c:\\\\unidade_auxiliar_NonExistingScript.ps1), and unusual sc.exe activity. These patterns suggest potential malicious behavior for persistence or execution.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_181019.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a list of events in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the events. Most of them are about registry value sets, which might be normal, but some are about process access and image loaded events. Let's see the details.\n\nLooking at the processes involved: ApplicationFrameHost.exe, Calculator.exe, powershell.exe, and chrome.exe. Chrome.exe has several entries, especially registry value sets. But then there's an image loaded event for chrome.exe with a path to amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Wait, amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. MpOAV.dll is also related to Windows Defender. \n\nNow, why would chrome.exe load these DLLs? Normally, these are legitimate files, but if they're being loaded by chrome.exe, that might be unusual. However, sometimes legitimate processes can load these DLLs if they're interacting with Defender. But maybe the fact that there are multiple registry changes and process accesses could be a sign. \n\nAnother thing is that powershell.exe is involved in process access events. PowerShell is often used in attacks, but it's also a normal tool. The presence of multiple registry modifications might be part of a configuration change, but if they're done by a non-admin process, that could be suspicious. \n\nHowever, looking at the events, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity like unexpected network connections, file deletions, or unauthorized access. The events are all related to registry changes and process accesses, which can be part of normal operations. The image loaded events for chrome.exe are loading legitimate Defender DLLs, which might be normal if chrome is being scanned by Defender. \n\nBut wait, the repetition of registry value sets for chrome.exe multiple times might indicate something. If a legitimate process is modifying the registry a lot, that could be normal, but if it's part of a larger pattern of suspicious activity, it might be a red flag. However, without more context, like the specific registry keys being modified, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe classification here depends on whether these events are part of normal operations or indicate a potential threat. Since the events don't include obvious malicious indicators like unexpected file paths, network activity, or privilege escalation, but there's a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities, maybe it's on the edge. However, the presence of the image load events for Defender DLLs by chrome.exe might be normal. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the batch might not be interesting enough for investigation because there's no clear malicious activity. The events could be part of normal system behavior, even though there's some unusual activity. But I'm not entirely sure. The confidence might be around 0.5, but since the justification is needed, maybe it's leaning towards not interesting unless there's more data.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events include common system behaviors (e.g., Chrome and PowerShell interacting with registry\/defender DLLs) without clear malicious indicators like unauthorized access, suspicious file paths, or anomalous network activity.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
