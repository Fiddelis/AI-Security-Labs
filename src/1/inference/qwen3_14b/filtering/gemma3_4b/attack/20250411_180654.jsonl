So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first event: powershell.exe created a file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\Downloads\\objeto_temporario.txt. That's a normal file creation, maybe just a temporary file. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there are several entries about chrome.exe setting registry values. Chrome doing registry changes might be normal, but repeated entries could indicate something. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe just part of normal operations.\n\nNext, there's a whoami.exe process created. That's a standard command to get user info. Not inherently malicious, but could be part of a larger attack.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that runs Get-Keystrokes.ps1 and saves to $env:TEMP\\key.log. That script name sounds suspicious. Keystrokes usually relate to keylogging, which is malicious. The log path is in the temporary directory, which is common for malware to hide logs.\n\nThen there are multiple image loads in PowerShell, including .NET DLLs. Loading these might be part of the script's execution, but if it's a legitimate script, that's okay. However, combined with the keylogging script, it's a red flag.\n\nAnother event shows the same Get-Keystrokes.ps1 being executed from different paths. That could be an indicator of persistence or multiple attempts to run the script. The presence of multiple similar events suggests an ongoing activity.\n\nAlso, the fact that PowerShell is being used to execute scripts that capture keystrokes is a strong sign of malicious intent. Even if the initial file creation seems benign, the subsequent actions point towards data exfiltration or reconnaissance.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch includes events that indicate a potential keylogging attack. The combination of the keystroke script, multiple PowerShell activities, and the loading of .NET components supports this. Therefore, this batch is interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute suspicious scripts named 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' with log paths in temporary directories, indicating potential keylogging activity. Combined with .NET image loads and repeated registry modifications, this suggests malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.9\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, there are three entries here. The first one is about svchost.exe creating a file in the Windows DeliveryOptimization directory. I know that svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. The file path mentioned is part of the DeliveryOptimization feature, which is used for file sharing between devices. The file name keyValueLKG.dat sounds like a normal state file for that service. I don't see anything suspicious here; it might just be part of normal system operations.\n\nThe second event is from winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipping tool. The file created is a .yml.new file in the Downloads directory. Since winlogbeat is used for monitoring and shipping logs, creating a configuration file in the Downloads folder might be part of a setup or update process. However, I should check if the file path is expected. The user might have manually placed the file there, but it's not immediately obvious if this is malicious. Still, it's a legitimate process, so maybe not a threat.\n\nThe third entry is powershell.exe creating a text file in the Downloads folder. PowerShell is a common tool used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. The file name \"entrada_padrao.txt\" doesn't ring any bells as a known malicious file. However, if this is the only action, it's hard to tell. But since there's no other suspicious activity mentioned, like network connections or unusual commands, it might just be a normal file creation.\n\nPutting it all together, none of the files are in system directories that are typically associated with malware. The processes involved are all legitimate, and the file names don't seem to be associated with known malicious payloads. The events don't show any signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other suspicious behaviors. Therefore, I would classify this batch as not interesting. The confidence is around 0.8 because while the events are normal, there's a slight possibility that the files could be part of an attack if there's more context, but with the given information, there's no clear indication of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"All events involve legitimate processes (svchost.exe, winlogbeat.exe, powershell.exe) creating files in expected locations (system directories, user Downloads folder). No suspicious file names, unusual paths, or malicious indicators observed.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.8\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180654.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through the events to spot any patterns or suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the process entries, there are several instances where powershell.exe is running with command lines that include \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" and logging to $env:TEMP\\key.log. The paths mentioned in the command lines are all different, but they all seem to be in various directories, which might be a red flag. The script name \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" sounds like it's related to keylogging, which is malicious. \n\nThen there are events about files being created and deleted, like the temporary files in AppData\\Local\\Temp. That's common, but when combined with the PowerShell scripts, it could be part of an attack. Also, there's a mention of \"Execute a Remote Command\" in one of the logs, which is definitely suspicious. \n\nThe winlog events include things like \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle,\" which might be normal, but the repeated use of the same PowerShell script across different paths is concerning. The fact that the same script is being called multiple times from different locations might indicate an attempt to evade detection. \n\nAdditionally, there's a file path pointing to \"C:\\elemento_comum\\registro_principal\\elemento_secundario\\src\\Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" under the \"Execute a Remote Command\" task. That could mean the script is being executed remotely, which is a clear sign of potential malicious activity. \n\nEven though some events are normal, like image loading for Windows Defender components, the combination of the PowerShell scripts, the remote command execution, and the multiple instances of the same script being run from different paths makes this batch look suspicious. The keyloggers are a strong indicator of malicious intent. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the presence of multiple keylogging scripts, remote command execution, and the pattern of the same script being used across different directories suggests that this is an interesting case for further investigation. The confidence is high because these are clear indicators of potential malware activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes execute 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' scripts from various paths, indicating potential keylogging activity.
