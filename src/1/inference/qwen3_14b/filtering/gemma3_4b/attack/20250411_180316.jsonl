The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. First, I'll scan through each entry to spot any anomalies or suspicious activities.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: RuntimeBroker.exe, notepad.exe, and powershell.exe triggering registry value set events. These are common processes, so maybe not immediately suspicious. However, the next entry is calc.exe loading urlmon.dll. Wait, urlmon.dll is a legitimate system file, but loading it from the System32 directory is normal. However, there's another entry where Calculator.exe also loads urlmon.dll. That's the same as the previous one, so maybe not an issue here.\n\nLooking further, there's a winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file might be normal, but the filename has a .new extension. Maybe it's a temporary file, but not necessarily a red flag. However, the next entry is a cmd.exe process running a command to delete notepad.exe processes using wmic. That's suspicious because deleting processes can be part of a cleanup after an attack. The command line uses \"cmd.exe \/c wmic process where name='notepad.exe' delete\", which is a clear indicator of someone trying to terminate specific processes.\n\nThen there's a WMIC.exe process created with the command to delete notepad.exe, which is the same as the previous command. Also, WMIC.exe is loading amsi.dll. Amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If a legitimate process is loading it, that's normal. However, if a malicious process is doing so, it might be to bypass defenses. But in this case, the process is WMIC.exe, which is a legitimate tool but often abused by attackers.\n\nAnother point is the repeated use of powershell.exe and cmd.exe with various registry and process access events. While PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, excessive use or in combination with other suspicious activities can indicate malicious intent. The presence of multiple registry value set events might suggest configuration changes or attempts to modify system settings.\n\nThe key suspicious activities here are the deletion of notepad.exe processes via wmic and the use of WMIC.exe, which is sometimes used in attacks. Also, the combination of these actions with other process accesses and registry modifications could indicate an attempt to manipulate the system or cover tracks. However, some of these events could be part of normal operations, like software installation or system updates. But the deletion of processes and the use of WMIC might be more indicative of malicious behavior, especially if done without user consent or in an unusual context.\n\nConsidering all these points, the batch does show some suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

The first thing I notice is the first event involving WMIC.exe loading a DLL from the Windows Defender directory. That path is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25030.2-0\\MpOAV.dll. Wait, MpOAV.dll is part of Windows Defender's Malicious Software Removal Tool. But why is WMIC.exe loading it? WMIC is a legitimate tool, but sometimes malware uses it to execute commands. However, the file path here is a standard Defender path, so maybe it's legitimate. But I should check if there are any other suspicious activities.\n\nLooking further, there are multiple entries for chrome.exe and other processes like notepad.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe. The winlog tasks are mostly Registry value sets and Process accessed events. The command lines for some cmd.exe processes are interesting. For example, one cmd.exe is running \"copy \/Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe\". That's a red flag. The sethc.exe is the Sticky Keys utility, and replacing it with a backup file could be part of a malicious activity, like a backdoor. Another cmd.exe is running \"schtasks \/tn win32times \/delete \/f\", which deletes a scheduled task. That might be an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.\n\nAlso, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe being accessed and registry changes. However, the justification for being interesting might be the combination of the WMIC loading a Defender DLL and the suspicious command lines in cmd.exe. But wait, the first event's file path is legitimate. The real concern is the command-line activities. The copy command replacing sethc.exe is a classic technique used by malware to replace system files. The deletion of the scheduled task could be to avoid detection. Even though some processes are legitimate, the combination of these specific command lines and the registry changes might indicate an attack. However, the confidence might be around 0.7 because while some events are suspicious, others are normal. But I need to check if the WMIC loading the DLL is legitimate. MpOAV.dll is part of Defender, so that might be normal. The other events, especially the cmd.exe commands, are more concerning.

But then there are several entries involving svchost.exe, cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and powershell.exe with registry events and process accesses. \n\nRegistry value sets and process accesses can be normal, but when they're frequent, especially from processes like powershell.exe and cmd.exe, that might be a red flag. The presence of whoami.exe being executed could be benign, but if it's part of a larger pattern, it might be suspicious. \n\nLooking at the files, there's chrome.exe loading amsi.dll and MpOAV.dll. Those are Windows Defender files, so that seems okay. But the repeated registry changes and process accesses might indicate someone trying to modify system settings or escalate privileges. \n\nHowever, there's no clear evidence of malicious activity here. The events don't show any unusual file paths, unexpected network activity, or privilege escalation attempts. The processes involved are common, and the events could be part of normal system operations or user activities. \n\nBut wait, the confidence level needs to be considered. Since there's a lot of registry changes and process accesses, even though they're from legitimate processes, the frequency might be concerning. However, without more context, like if these events are part of a known good process or if there's a pattern that deviates from the norm, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior.

That's a normal command to get the current user, so probably benign. Then there are several 'powershell.exe' processes. Now, PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate tasks and malicious activities. But looking at the tasks here: Process Create, Process Access, Registry value set, Image loaded, File created and deleted. \n\nWait, the Image Load events are loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll. Those are part of the .NET runtime, so that's normal when PowerShell is running scripts that require the .NET framework. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_ay0v2obp.23h.ps1, and then it's deleted. Creating and deleting a script file in Temp might be part of a normal script execution, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities. However, the name here seems like a test script, maybe related to checking script policy settings. \n\nAlso, there are multiple 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle' events with command_line 'powershell.exe & {}'. The empty script block might be part of some testing or configuration. But why so many of them? Maybe the system is under some kind of monitoring or testing, but could also be part of an attack trying to evade detection by executing empty commands. \n\nAnother thing is the presence of 'winlogbeat.exe' creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so this might be part of a legitimate setup or configuration change. However, if this is unexpected, it could be a sign of someone trying to configure or tamper with the log shipping process. \n\nLooking at the confidence level, there are some suspicious activities like the script file creation and deletion, but they might be benign. The repeated lifecycle events with empty commands could indicate something unusual. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The presence of .NET DLLs being loaded is normal for PowerShell. \n\nOverall, there's some suspicious activity, but not enough to be certain.

That seems normal, but maybe the path is a bit odd. Wait, MpClient.dll is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. But why is it being loaded by PowerShell? Maybe just a regular process, but not sure yet.\n\nNext, there's a file created in the user's AppData folder. That's a common place for temporary files, but maybe something's going on here. Then, several registry value set events for PowerShell and conhost.exe. Changing registry values can be suspicious if done by unexpected processes.\n\nLooking at the command lines for PowerShell, there are a bunch of Test-Path commands checking for various .bat files. The paths have some strange patterns like \"..\\\" which might indicate trying to access parent directories. But the scripts aren't actually being executed; they're just checking if they exist. However, the fact that PowerShell is being used repeatedly to check for these files could be part of a larger malicious activity, like looking for existing scripts to execute or modify.\n\nThere's also a Process Create event for PowerShell with a command line that checks for a specific .bat file. The paths here are a bit convoluted, which might be an attempt to obfuscate the actual location. The repeated use of Test-Path could be part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, possibly to decide the next steps in an attack.\n\nThe Image Load events for mscoree.dll and mscoreei.dll are related to .NET runtime, which is normal for PowerShell, so that's probably okay. But the combination of multiple registry changes, file creation, and these Test-Path commands might indicate something more. \n\nHowever, I don't see any direct evidence of malicious activity like downloading files, executing payloads, or connecting to external IPs. It's all about checking for existence of files and modifying registry. Maybe it's a benign script, but the frequency and the paths being checked could be suspicious.

There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images, like clr.dll, mscorlib.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, and MpOAV.dll, MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. These are all legitimate system files, so loading them might be normal. But then there's a file created and then deleted in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_ki2iskry.alp.ps1. Creating and deleting a file could be part of a script testing, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities.\n\nAnother file created is elemento_padrao.txt in the Downloads folder. Not sure if that's suspicious yet. Then there are multiple registry value set events from Chrome.exe. A lot of registry changes might be normal, but if it's too many, it could indicate something. However, Chrome sometimes makes registry changes, so maybe not a big red flag.\n\nLooking at the command lines for some PowerShell processes, they're checking if certain paths exist and exiting with 0 or 1. These paths like C:\\modulo_ativo\\objeto_ativo\\.. etc., seem like they might be testing for the existence of files. But the names are generic, maybe part of a script that's supposed to run under certain conditions. However, the fact that they're using PowerShell to check paths might be normal, but combined with other events?\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the batch should be analyzed as a whole. So, even though individual events might be normal, the combination might be suspicious. The creation and deletion of the Temp file could be an attempt to execute a script and then clean up. Also, the multiple registry changes from Chrome might be part of a larger attack, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is that the PowerShell processes are loading various DLLs, including some from Windows Defender. That might be normal, but if those DLLs are being loaded in an unusual way or from unexpected locations, that could be a problem. However, the paths here are standard system paths, so maybe not.\n\nThe presence of both file creation and deletion might be a red flag. Attackers often create temporary files to execute malicious code and then delete them to avoid leaving evidence. However, the file names here are not obviously malicious, but the fact that it's being created and then deleted quickly could be suspicious.\n\nAlso, the command lines in the PowerShell processes involve checking for the existence of certain files. If those files are part of a legitimate process, that's fine. But if they're checking for files that shouldn't exist, that might be a sign of something else. However, the names here are generic and don't immediately stand out.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of normal system activities (loading .NET DLLs, Windows Defender DLLs) and some file operations (creating and deleting a Temp file, creating a text file). The registry changes from Chrome might be normal. However, the combination of creating a file and then deleting it quickly, along with multiple PowerShell events, might indicate some kind of script execution that's being cleaned up.

The first event is 'whoami.exe' being executed, which is a normal Windows command to get the current user. That's usually benign. Then there are several instances of 'powershell.exe' with different tasks. The tasks include things like 'Process Create', 'Process accessed', 'Registry value set', and 'Image loaded'. \n\nNow, the command lines for the PowerShell processes are a bit suspicious. They all have a similar structure: using Test-Path to check if a certain executable exists in a specific directory, then exiting with 0 or 1. The paths mentioned are like \"C:\\pacote_principal\\objeto_base...\" and other long, non-standard directories. These paths don't look like typical system paths. Usually, legitimate software would be in places like Program Files or AppData, but these seem custom and possibly crafted by an attacker.\n\nAlso, the fact that there are multiple PowerShell processes checking for the existence of various .exe files in these directories could be part of a reconnaissance phase. The attacker might be checking if certain files exist to determine the environment or to look for vulnerabilities. \n\nThen, looking at the 'Image loaded' events, PowerShell is loading several .dll files from the .NET Framework. While this is normal for PowerShell to use .NET assemblies, the specific DLLs listed are part of the .NET runtime, which is expected. However, the combination of these image loads with the Test-Path commands might indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not standard, perhaps to execute scripts or payloads.\n\nAnother thing is the repetition of similar command lines. Each PowerShell instance is checking a different path, but the structure is the same. This could be a pattern where the attacker is probing the system for specific files, maybe looking for existing malicious software or trying to map the file system.\n\nThe 'Registry value set' event might indicate changes to the registry, which could be part of persistence mechanisms.

However, the paths mentioned like \"C:\\\\registro_principal\\\\registro_temporario\\\\registro_secundario\\\\bin\\\\componente_secundario.exe\" seem a bit odd. They have a lot of Spanish terms (\"registro\" means register or record), which might be a red flag if this is in a non-Spanish speaking environment, or if it's part of a malicious script trying to obfuscate.\n\nAnother entry has a File created in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a known location where PowerShell might store startup profiles, but creating a file there could be part of persistence mechanisms if done maliciously.\n\nThere are multiple Registry value set events and Process accessed events. These could be benign, but combined with other activities, they might indicate attempts to modify system settings or access processes for malicious purposes.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe and cmd.exe processes is normal, but the command lines are simple checks for file existence. However, the repetition of these checks and the combination with PowerShell activities might suggest automated scripts trying to probe the system.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The events aren't overtly malicious, but the combination of file creation\/deletion, unusual paths, and multiple registry\/process accesses could indicate something suspicious. However, without more context, like known bad indicators or additional logs, it's hard to be certain. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" because there are enough anomalies that warrant further investigation, even if they aren't definitive proof of an attack.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving file creation\/deletion in temporary directories, registry modifications, and process access events.

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look at the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking through the logs, most of them are about PowerShell.exe being accessed or creating processes. There's also some entries about image loading, like mscoree.dll and clr.dll. Those are .NET related libraries, which are normal for PowerShell to use. But then I see a few command lines that have PowerShell scripts checking if certain files exist. The paths mentioned are things like \"C:\\pacote_ativo\\estrutura_auxiliar...\" and others. These paths look a bit odd because they have a lot of subdirectories and specific names that might be part of a custom application or maybe something malicious.\n\nWait, the command lines are using Test-Path to check for specific .cs files. That's a PowerShell command to check if a file exists. But why are they doing that? Maybe they're part of a script that's trying to determine if certain files are present, which could be part of a setup or installation process. However, the repetition of these checks in different paths might be a red flag. Also, the fact that multiple PowerShell processes are accessing and loading .NET assemblies could indicate something is trying to execute code or load modules.\n\nBut I should check if there's any actual malicious activity. The logs don't show any direct attacks, like downloading files or connecting to external IPs. They're all about process creation and file checks. However, the high number of PowerShell events and the specific file paths might be indicative of a script-based attack, like a PowerShell Empire or similar framework. Also, the use of \"Provider Lifecycle\" in some entries might be related to event logs being manipulated, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thing is that the same PowerShell process is being accessed multiple times, and some of the image loads are from .NET frameworks. That's normal, but the combination with the Test-Path commands could be part of a larger malicious activity. However, without seeing any actual malicious payloads or network activity, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nConsidering all that, the logs might be part of a legitimate process, but the pattern of multiple PowerShell executions checking for specific files could be suspicious. The confidence here is a bit uncertain. Maybe around 0.65?

The user wants me to analyze the entire batch and determine if it's interesting for investigation. Alright, first I'll scan through each event to see what's going on.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File deleted, Pipe created, etc. Some of the files mentioned are from Windows Defender, like MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll. Those are legitimate files, so maybe that's normal. But then there are other files in the Temp directory, like __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1. The fact that a file is created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Why create and delete a script file in Temp? Maybe it's part of a cleanup, but sometimes attackers do that to hide their activities.\n\nLooking at the command lines, there are several instances where PowerShell is checking if certain files exist, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in various paths. The names like \"Get-Keystrokes.ps1\" stand out. That sounds like a script that might be capturing keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity. The paths mentioned are all over the place, some seem random or temporary. The repeated checks for these files could indicate that the attacker is trying to locate or execute a keystroke logging script.\n\nAlso, there's a whoami.exe process, which is normal, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger attack. However, the main red flags here are the creation and deletion of temporary scripts and the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. Even though the files are being deleted, the fact that they exist in the Temp directory and are associated with PowerShell could be indicative of malicious behavior. \n\nBut wait, some of the files are from Windows Defender. That might be a false positive. However, the combination of multiple events, especially the repeated checks for keystroke logging scripts, increases the suspicion. The confidence here is moderate because while some activities are normal, the specific scripts and the pattern of events suggest potential malicious intent. I need to make sure I'm not overreacting, but the presence of \"Get-Keystrokes\" is a strong indicator. So, I'd classify this as interesting with a confidence around 0.75.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events involve creating and deleting temporary scripts (e.g., __PSScriptPolicyTest_laphjvgu.fp2.ps1) and repeated checks for 'Get-Keystrokes.ps1' in various paths, which may indicate keystroke logging attempts or lateral movement.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/attack\/20250411_180316.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are related to PowerShell.exe. There are several instances where PowerShell is running commands that check if a specific file exists, like Get-Keystrokes.ps1. The paths mentioned are in different directories, but the filename is consistent. That's a red flag because Get-Keystrokes.ps1 sounds like a script that could be used to capture keystrokes, which is a common malicious activity.\n\nThen, there are entries about image loads. PowerShell is loading various DLLs, some from the .NET framework, which is normal. But there's also a mention of MpOAV.dll and MpClient.dll from Windows Defender. That might be normal too, but I need to check if there's anything unusual. However, the presence of these DLLs doesn't immediately indicate a problem unless there's something else.\n\nAnother thing is the file creation and deletion. There's a temporary file created and then immediately deleted. That's common in some scripts, but if it's part of a larger malicious activity, it might be a sign. However, the filename includes __PSScriptPolicyTest, which might relate to PowerShell script execution policies. Maybe that's part of a legitimate process, but combined with the other events, it could be suspicious.\n\nThe Pipe Created event might be normal, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The key thing here is the repeated checks for the existence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1. If that script is present, it might be used to steal information. The fact that the command is checking for that file's existence and exiting with 0 or 1 could be part of a larger attack, like checking if the script is in place before executing it.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the events are in JSONL format, so each line is a separate event. The classification is based on the entire batch. The presence of multiple PowerShell events, especially those checking for a keystroke log script, combined with the file operations, makes me think this could be a legitimate script or a malicious one. However, the consistent use of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 in different paths might be a sign of a script that's being deployed across the system, which is suspicious.\n\nI should also consider that some of the events are from winlogbeat.exe, which is a log shipper. The file creation there might be part of normal operations, but it's not directly related to the PowerShell activities.\n\nPutting it all together, the repeated PowerShell commands checking for the existence of a keystroke script, along with the image loads and file operations, suggest that there might be an attempt to execute a malicious script. However, without seeing the actual content of the script or more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of Get-Keystrokes.ps1 is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.

The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. First, I need to scan through all the entries and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nStarting with the first event: PowerShell.exe created a file in the StartupProfileData-NonInteractive directory. That's a common place for PowerShell profiles, but sometimes attackers use similar paths for malicious scripts. Not sure yet, need to check more.\n\nNext, there are several entries about PowerShell.exe accessing processes and registry values. Multiple ProcessAccess events might indicate someone is trying to monitor or manipulate other processes. But PowerShell is a normal tool, so this isn't necessarily bad.\n\nThen there's whoami.exe being executed. That's a standard command to get user info, so probably benign. Notepad.exe and calc.exe are also normal, unless they're doing something unusual. The image loaded events for urlmon.dll are normal too, as that's a legitimate Windows DLL.\n\nLooking at the winlogbeat.exe event, it created a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is normal. But maybe if the file was in an unusual location or had unexpected content, but here it's in the Downloads directory, which is common for such files.\n\nThere are multiple network connections from chrome.exe and svchost.exe. Chrome making network connections is normal, especially if it's browsing. Svchost hosting services might have legitimate network activity. The DNS queries are also normal for browsing.\n\nNow, looking for any anomalies. The first event's file path is in AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell, which is a legitimate location for PowerShell profiles. However, the fact that PowerShell is creating a file there might be part of normal operations, but if it's unexpected, it could be a red flag. But without more context, like the file's content or other suspicious activities, it's hard to say.\n\nThe repeated ProcessAccess events on PowerShell might be part of normal operations, but if they're being accessed by other processes in a way that's not typical, that could be an issue. However, the logs don't show any clear signs of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n\nThe presence of multiple legitimate processes (like chrome, svchost, notepad) doing normal things (networking, registry changes) doesn't indicate a problem. The only slightly suspicious thing is the PowerShell file creation, but without more context, it's not enough to classify this as interesting.\n\nSo, overall, the events don't show a clear pattern of malicious activity. They seem to be normal system operations and legitimate process behaviors.

Not suspicious here.\n\nThen there's powershell.exe being accessed a few times. Process access events are common, but maybe if it's too frequent? But I need to check more.\n\nNext, whoami.exe is run. That's a legitimate command to check user identity. Not a red flag on its own.\n\nThen there's a lot of powershell.exe events again. The command line shows commands like ls -recurse and get-childitem -recurse. These are PowerShell commands to list files recursively. Maybe someone is trying to explore the file system? But again, could be part of normal troubleshooting.\n\nThen, the ImageLoad events for various DLLs. Some are system DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll, which are part of .NET. That's normal for PowerShell. However, there's also MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. Loading that might be unusual unless it's part of a legitimate scan. But why would PowerShell load that? Maybe something's trying to bypass Defender?\n\nThen there's a FileCreated and FileDelete event for a temporary script file. Creating and deleting a script could be part of a legitimate process, but if it's a malicious script, that's a problem. The file is in the Temp directory, which is common for temporary files, but the name is a bit generic. However, the fact that it's created and then immediately deleted might be suspicious. Maybe the script was executed and then deleted to cover tracks.\n\nAlso, the PipeCreated event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication. Not inherently bad, but if there's a lot of them or in unusual contexts, it might be a sign of something.\n\nLooking at the command lines again, the PowerShell commands are using a lot of recursion. Maybe trying to find something specific? But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering all these events together. There's a lot of activity around PowerShell, loading various DLLs, creating and deleting a script file. The presence of the Defender DLL being loaded by PowerShell might be a red flag. Also, the repeated access and image loads could indicate that PowerShell is being used in a way that's not typical. Maybe someone is trying to execute scripts or perform actions that are not standard.\n\nHowever, some of these events could be part of normal system operations or legitimate troubleshooting. But the combination of creating a script file, deleting it, and the unusual DLL loading might point towards something malicious.

That seems like a command to list files recursively. But why is this happening multiple times? Maybe it's part of normal user activity, but repeated commands might be a red flag. Also, the winlog tasks include things like Provider Lifecycle, Engine Lifecycle, and File created or Registry events. \n\nWait, there's a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\StartupProfileData-NonInteractive. That path is under PowerShell's startup profile data. Creating a file there could be normal, but maybe if it's being modified or accessed in an unusual way. Also, there's a registry value set event for powershell.exe. Registry changes can be a sign of persistence mechanisms or configuration changes. \n\nAnother thing is the presence of winlogbeat.exe creating a .yml.new file. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so maybe that's part of a configuration change. But if it's being tampered with, that could be an issue. However, the user hasn't mentioned any anomalies in the winlogbeat files, so maybe that's just normal operation.\n\nThe command line in PowerShell using multiple aliases (ls, gci) might be obfuscation. Attackers sometimes use different aliases for the same command to avoid detection. But in this case, the commands are standard, so maybe not malicious.
