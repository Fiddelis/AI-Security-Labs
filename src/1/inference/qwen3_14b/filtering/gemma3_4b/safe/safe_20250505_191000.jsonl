The majority of the entries are about \"User Account Management\" under winlog's task, but those don't seem to have any process or file details. Then there are a few entries related to EXCEL.EXE.\n\nFirst, there's an image loaded event for coml2.dll. That's a system file, so loading it from Excel might be normal, but sometimes it can be part of malicious activity if it's not expected. Then there are multiple DNS queries from Excel. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if they're going to suspicious domains or happening in excess, that could be a red flag.\n\nNext, there are two file creation events for a .LNK file in the Recent folder. Shortcut files can be used by attackers to hide malicious payloads. The fact that it's in the Recent directory might indicate that the user interacted with it, but if the file was created without user knowledge, that's a problem. However, the file name \"real_values.csv.LNK\" doesn't immediately look malicious, but the context matters.\n\nThe user account management events don't have any obvious malicious indicators, so they might be benign. The EXCEL.EXE activities are more concerning. The combination of DNS queries and file creation could suggest that Excel is being used to communicate with a C2 server or to create shortcuts that execute malicious code. However, without more context like the domains involved in the DNS queries or the content of the shortcut, it's a bit hard to be certain. But the presence of these events, especially the file creation in a user's AppData folder, is suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. So, I'd classify this as interesting with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE and creation of a suspicious .LNK file in the Recent directory may indicate malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. First, I need to look for any patterns or anomalies.\n\nLooking at the processes involved, there's a lot of activity with SDXHelper.exe. It's loading several system DLLs like urlmon.dll and combase.dll multiple times. That's a red flag because legitimate processes usually don't load the same DLLs repeatedly, especially if they're system files. Also, SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process, so that's suspicious.\n\nThen there's rundll32.exe executing a command with shell32.dll and a GUID. That might be part of normal operations, but the specific GUID could be something malicious. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nThe Excel process is loading several DLLs, which is normal for Excel. But the presence of amsi.dll and Defender's MpOAV.dll might be part of the system's security checks. However, if Excel is loading these, it's not necessarily bad. \n\nThere's also a file creation event for winlogbeat.yml.new. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating a config file is normal. But if that's part of an attack, maybe they're trying to configure it for data exfiltration. However, the event just shows a file creation, not any malicious activity.\n\nThe WmiPrvSE.exe process is involved in WMI activities, which can be used by malware. But again, it's a legitimate process. The key is whether there's anything unusual in the parameters or other logs.\n\nThe User Account Management events are logged multiple times, but without more info, they might be part of normal user activity. \n\nPutting it all together, the main concern is SDXHelper.exe's repeated loading of system DLLs. That's not typical behavior and could indicate a malicious process. However, I need to check if there are other signs. The other events don't seem to point to obvious malicious activity. \n\nSo, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because the SDXHelper.exe behavior is suspicious. The confidence is around 0.7 because while there's a red flag, more data would be needed to confirm malicious intent.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple instances of SDXHelper.exe loading system DLLs (urlmon.dll, combase.dll) repeatedly, which may indicate malicious behavior. While some process activity (e.g., Excel, WmiPrvSE) appears legitimate, the pattern of SDXHelper.exe's image loads raises suspicion.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.7\n}"}
