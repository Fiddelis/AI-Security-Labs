{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if this batch of events is interesting or not. So, the user is asking me to analyze these logs and determine if there's any malicious activity going on. Let me go through each event step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the events, there are several entries where the process \"SDXHelper.exe\" is loading system DLLs like combase.dll and urlmon.dll. Now, these DLLs are legitimate Windows system files, so just loading them might not be suspicious on its own. But I should check if there's anything unusual about how they're being loaded. The events mention \"Image loaded (rule: ImageLoad)\" which is a common event, but if a process is loading multiple system DLLs, maybe that's normal. However, I need to see if there's any other context.\n\nThen there's an event where rundll32.exe is executing a command with shell32.dll. The command line here is a bit long, but it's using the SHCreateLocalServerRunDll with a specific CLSID. I'm not sure if that's a red flag, but sometimes malicious software uses rundll32 to execute code. However, without more info on the CLSID, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's a legitimate process, but I should note that.\n\nNext, there's svchost.exe and winlogbeat.exe creating files. The winlogbeat file creation seems normal, as it's part of the software's configuration. The svchost.exe events involve registry value changes, which can be normal for services, but again, need to check for any suspicious changes.\n\nThen there's EXCEL.EXE loading several DLLs, including combase.dll, mscoree.dll, urlmon.dll, amsi.dll, and a Defender DLL. Excel is a common application, and these DLLs are part of the system or security software. However, amsi.dll is related to Windows Defender's Antimalware Scan Interface. If Excel is loading that, maybe it's part of a legitimate process, but sometimes malicious code might interact with these components. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the WmiPrvSE.exe events, which is related to Windows Management Instrumentation. The command line includes -secured and -Embedding, which might be normal for some operations. The image loaded is wmiutils.dll, which is a legitimate file. So that might be okay.\n\nNow, looking for any patterns. The SDXHelper.exe is repeatedly loading system DLLs. Is there any indication that this process is malicious? SDXHelper.exe isn't a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a third-party application, but if it's loading system DLLs, that's not unusual. However, if it's doing so in a way that's not typical for its function, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, there are multiple events with \"User Account Management\" tasks, but no process or file info. Those might be normal administrative activities, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the presence of multiple ImageLoad events for the same process and DLLs. If SDXHelper.exe is loading the same DLLs multiple times, maybe that's normal for the application. But if it's loading DLLs that are not typically used by that process, that could be suspicious.\n\nLooking at the command line for rundll32.exe, the CLSID {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6} might be something I can check. However, without knowing what that specific CLSID does, I can't be certain. It could be a legitimate service or a malicious one. But since the user hasn't provided more info, I can't confirm.\n\nThe EXCEL.EXE events are loading several system DLLs, which is normal for Excel. For example, mscoree.dll is related to .NET, and urlmon.dll is used for internet-related functions. The amsi.dll is part of Windows Defender, so Excel might be interacting with it as part of a scan or something. That seems legitimate.\n\nThe services.exe event with a logon might be part of normal system startup. The \"Special Logon\" event is also something that could happen during user authentication.\n\nPutting it all together, there's nothing overtly malicious here. The processes involved are mostly legitimate Windows components or common applications like Excel. The SDXHelper.exe might be a less-known process, but without more context, like if it's installed by the user or part of a known application, it's hard to say. However, the fact that it's loading system DLLs multiple times doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. The other events don't show any signs of unusual activity, like unexpected network connections, file modifications, or privilege escalation.\n\nI think the key here is that there's no clear evidence of malicious activity. The events are either normal system operations or related to legitimate software. Unless there's more context, like if SDXHelper.exe is known to be malicious or if other security tools have flagged it, I can't confirm a threat. Therefore, the batch of events doesn't seem to be interesting from a security standpoint.\n<\/think>\n\nThe analysis of the provided log entries does not reveal clear evidence of malicious activity. Here's a structured assessment:\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Legitimate System Processes and DLLs:**\n   - Processes like **`svchost.exe`**, **`WmiPrvSE.exe`**, and **`services.exe`** are standard Windows components involved in system management and WMI operations. Their activities (e.g., registry modifications, logon events) align with normal system behavior.\n   - **`EXCEL.EXE`** loading DLLs such as **`combase.dll`**, **`urlmon.dll`**, and **`amsi.dll`** is typical for Excel, which relies on system libraries and interacts with Windows Defender (via **`amsi.dll`**) for security checks.\n\n2. **`SDXHelper.exe` and System DLLs:**\n   - **`SDXHelper.exe`** repeatedly loads system DLLs like **`combase.dll`** and **`urlmon.dll`**. While **`SDXHelper.exe`** is not a standard Windows process, loading system DLLs is common for applications that require system-level interactions. Without additional context (e.g., file paths, digital signatures, or user installation details), this behavior alone is not suspicious.\n\n3. **`rundll32.exe` and WMI:**\n   - The **`rundll32.exe`** command involving **`shell32.dll`** and the CLSID **`{9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6}`** is ambiguous. While **`rundll32.exe`** is often exploited by malware, the specific CLSID is not known to be malicious in isolation. **`WmiPrvSE.exe`** loading **`wmiutils.dll`** is also consistent with legitimate WMI operations.\n\n4. **User Account Management Events:**\n   - Multiple **`User Account Management`** and **`Special Logon`** events lack process or file context. These could reflect routine user authentication or administrative tasks, but further investigation would be needed to confirm.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe log entries reflect normal system operations and legitimate application behavior. There is **no overt evidence of malicious activity** (e.g., unexpected network traffic, unauthorized file modifications, or anomalous process interactions). However, **`SDXHelper.exe`** warrants further scrutiny if it is not a known, trusted application or if it exhibits additional suspicious behavior in other logs.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **Not Interesting** (No malicious activity detected)."}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_191000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided a bunch of log entries in JSONL format, and I need to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. The answer has to be either \"INTERESTING\" or \"NOT INTERESTING\" with a justification and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the logs. The first five entries are all about \"User Account Management\" under winlog's task. But since the process and file fields are null, maybe they're just regular system events. Not sure yet.\n\nThen, starting from the sixth entry, there's a process named EXCEL.EXE. The tasks here are \"Image loaded\", \"Dns query\", and \"File created\". The image loaded event points to coml2.dll, which is a legitimate Windows file, but sometimes malicious software can load DLLs in unexpected ways. However, just loading a system DLL might not be suspicious on its own.\n\nNext, there are multiple DNS queries from EXCEL.EXE. DNS queries themselves aren't necessarily bad, but if they're going to unusual domains or happening frequently, that could be a red flag. However, the logs don't mention the domains being queried, so I can't tell from the given data.\n\nThen there are two entries where EXCEL.EXE creates a file called real_values.csv.LNK in the Recent folder. .LNK files are shortcuts, and creating them in the Recent directory might be normal if the user is interacting with files. However, if the shortcut points to something malicious, that could be bad. But again, the logs don't show the target of the shortcut. The filename \"real_values.csv\" might be a red herring, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNow, considering all the events together: there's a mix of normal user account management events and some activities from Excel. The key here is whether these events, when combined, indicate a potential security threat. The fact that Excel is performing DNS queries and creating shortcuts might be benign if the user is, for example, accessing a legitimate website or saving a file. However, the repetition of DNS queries and the creation of a shortcut might be worth investigating, especially if there's no clear user interaction or if the activities are out of the ordinary for the user.\n\nBut looking at the data again, all the events are from Excel, which is a common application. If the user is actively using Excel, some of these activities might be normal. However, the presence of multiple DNS queries and a file creation could be part of a larger pattern. However, without more context, such as the domains being queried or the content of the shortcut, it's hard to determine malicious intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the first five entries are all about User Account Management. If those are part of a legitimate user activity, like changing passwords or managing accounts, they might not be suspicious. But if those events are occurring in a pattern that's unusual, like multiple account management tasks without user interaction, that could be a problem. However, the logs don't provide enough details to confirm that.\n\nPutting it all together, the batch includes some normal system events and some activities from Excel. The Excel-related events might be benign, but the repetition and the creation of a shortcut could be worth looking into. However, without more information, it's not conclusive. The confidence level might be around 0.6, as there are some suspicious elements but not enough to confirm malicious activity definitively. Therefore, the classification is \"INTERESTING\" because there are potential indicators that warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple DNS queries and file creation events from EXCEL.EXE, potentially indicating unusual behavior. While some events are benign, the combination may warrant further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
