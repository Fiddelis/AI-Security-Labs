SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It's involved in handling solution packages. But creating a bunch of JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles subdirectory... Hmm. Usually, Office might store some resources, but creating multiple files with unique hashes could be a red flag. \n\nWait, the same files are being created multiple times.

The hashes in the filenames look like SHA-1 hashes, which are typically used for unique identifiers. If these files are part of a legitimate package, they might be using these hashes to ensure integrity. But the repetition of the same files being created multiple times could indicate an issue.

If the user hasn't installed anything related to Excel Copilot, this could be unexpected.\n\nAnother angle: the process creating the files is SDXHelper.exe. I should verify if this process is legitimate. A quick check in the Windows registry or using tools like Process Explorer would help, but since I can't do that here, I'll have to rely on known information. SDXHelper.exe is indeed associated with Microsoft Office, specifically with the deployment of solutions.

That repetition might be a red flag because typically, legitimate software wouldn't create the same file multiple times unless it's part of a normal process, like caching or updates.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office Deployment Tool, right? It's used for installing or updating Office.

SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It might be involved in installing or updating solutions.

The repetition of the same process creating multiple files with unique hashes in a specific directory might be benign, but it's also a pattern that could be used by malware to store payloads. \n\nConsidering that, I think this is interesting enough to warrant further investigation.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office suite, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or solutions. The files being created are in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles folder, which might be related to caching or storing resources for Office add-ins.

It's a legitimate process, but why is it here? Maybe the system is cleaning up temporary files, but that doesn't directly relate to the other events. However, if the Disk Cleanup was triggered by something else, maybe there's a connection. But I don't see any suspicious activity in the cleanmgr entry itself.\n\nLooking at the paths again, all files are under the user's AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office directory. That's a common location for Office-related files, so maybe it's legitimate. However, the fact that SDXHelper.exe is creating so many files here could be part of an update or installation process. But Office updates usually don't generate so many individual JavaScript files in that manner.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are these files expected? If the user has Office Copilot or other add-ins installed, maybe these are part of their normal operation. However, the repetition and the number of files might be unusual. Also, the presence of \"min\" in some filenames suggests minified JavaScript, which is common for web resources but less so in desktop applications. Maybe these files are being injected or downloaded from an external source, which could be a sign of a malicious payload.\n\nBut without more context, like network activity or other processes, it's hard to say.

The only other event is cleanmgr.exe, which isn't suspicious on its own. \n\nSo, the main points are: SDXHelper.exe creating multiple files in a specific directory, which might be normal for Office, but the repetition and the number of files could be indicative of something. However, since all events are related to legitimate processes and paths, and there's no clear sign of malicious activity like unexpected network calls, privilege escalation, or execution of suspicious files, it might be a false positive or a normal update.\n\nBut the classification needs to be based on whether the batch is interesting for investigation. Since the events are all about file creation by SDXHelper.exe in a legitimate path, but with multiple instances, maybe it's worth looking into. However, without additional suspicious indicators, it might not be a high priority. \n\nI think the confidence here is moderate.

If this process is not known to be part of Microsoft Office, that's a concern. Maybe it's a third-party application or malware. But how can I verify that? Without more context on the system's normal processes, it's hard to say. However, the fact that multiple files are being created in a specific pattern might suggest automated behavior, which could be part of a larger attack, like data exfiltration or establishing a foothold.\n\nAlso, the filenames have unique hashes, which might be part of a technique to avoid detection by having unique names each time. However, the same files are being created multiple times, which might not be typical for legitimate software. Legitimate software usually doesn't create the same file repeatedly unless there's an error or a loop.\n\nConsidering all this, the repeated creation of similar files by SDXHelper.exe in a non-standard way (especially if SDXHelper isn't a known legitimate process) could indicate malicious activity. However, without more information on what SDXHelper.exe is, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the context of the files being in Office directories and the repetitive nature, it's leaning towards being interesting for investigation.

So, the user provided a bunch of JSON entries, each indicating that the SDXHelper.exe process created a file in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages. The files are JavaScript files with names that include \"officeaicopilot-strings\" and \"word-copilot.min\" with various hashes in the filenames.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is normal behavior or if it's suspicious. SDXHelper.exe is part of the Microsoft Office suite, right? It's involved in managing add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple JavaScript files in the OfflineFiles directory... Hmm. Normally, Office might download or install resources, but the repetition here might be a red flag.\n\nWait, looking at the file paths, they're all in the PackageResources\\OfflineFiles subdirectory. The filenames have hashes, which could be part of versioning or unique identifiers. But the same files are being created multiple times. Each entry is a FileCreated event, which could be normal during installation, but if this is happening in a short time frame, it might indicate something like a malicious payload being dropped.\n\nAlso, the process is SDXHelper.exe. I should check if this process is legitimate. Microsoft Office does use SDXHelper.exe for certain operations, but if it's creating numerous files with random hashes, that might not be standard. However, the filenames seem to be related to Office Copilot, which is a legitimate feature. But why so many files? Maybe it's part of an update or installation process. However, the repetition of the same files being created multiple times might be an indicator of something else, like a script being executed repeatedly or a malicious actor using the process to inject files.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the presence of multiple entries for the same file. If the same file is being created multiple times by the same process, that might be unusual. It could be a sign of a script that's being run multiple times, or perhaps a mistake in the logging. But given that all the events are from the same process and same file paths, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate process, but the volume might be concerning.\n\nI should also think about the context. If this is the only activity, it's hard to say. But since the user is asking if the batch is interesting for investigation, I need to determine if there's enough here to warrant looking further. The fact that multiple files are being created with similar names and hashes, all by SDXHelper.exe, might be normal during an Office update or installation. However, if this is happening in a non-standard context or if there are other suspicious activities not shown here, it could be a problem.\n\nBut based solely on the provided logs, the repeated creation of files by a legitimate process might not be enough to classify as interesting. However, the presence of multiple entries for the same files could be a sign of something unusual. Alternatively, if these files are part of a legitimate Office feature, then it's not a problem. But without more context, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the files are in the OfflineFiles directory. That's used for storing resources that are used when the user is offline. But creating multiple JavaScript files there might be part of an update. However, the fact that the same files are being created multiple times might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the logs are duplicates, but the user provided them as separate entries.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the classification here is \"NOT INTERESTING\" because the activities are consistent with a legitimate process (SDXHelper.exe) creating files as part of Office's normal operations, even if the repetition is notable.

All of them are about files being created by SDXHelper.exe in specific directories under Microsoft Office's SolutionPackages.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft's Office solution, possibly related to packaging or deployment. The files are being created in the OfflineFiles subdirectory, which might be part of a legitimate process where Office updates or installs resources.\n\nHowever, the repetition of the same process and the same file paths multiple times could indicate something. If these files are being created multiple times, maybe there's an issue like a loop or an attack. But looking at the paths, they seem to be part of different packages (different GUIDs in the directory names). Each package might correspond to different updates or installations.\n\nThe filenames include \"officeaicopilot\" and \"word-copilot,\" which might relate to Microsoft's Copilot feature. If these files are part of a legitimate update, then it's normal. However, the presence of multiple files with similar names and hashes might be a red flag. But without additional context, like other events (e.g., network activity, process anomalies), it's hard to say.\n\nThe key here is that all events are the same process creating files in expected locations. There's no indication of unusual process behavior, no unexpected parent processes, no network connections, or other malicious indicators. The repetition might be due to multiple package installations.

For example, officeaicopilot-strings.min_e4c0785d28a655cfa8c7e561caea1f62.js appears twice. Maybe that's part of a normal process, like a retry or a redundant creation.

Typically, legitimate processes from Microsoft would be things like Office related ones, but maybe SDXHelper is part of some add-in or solution package. However, the fact that it's creating files in the SolutionPackages directory might be normal if it's part of Office's installation or updates.

SDXHelper.exe is part of Microsoft Office, right? It might be involved in handling add-ins or solutions. But creating multiple files with those names... Hmm. The paths are in the AppData folder, which is common for user-specific files, but Office usually installs in Program Files. However, some temporary or cached files might be stored in AppData.\n\nNow, looking at the filenames. The \"word-copilot.min\" suggests it's related to Word's Copilot feature, which is a newer AI assistant. The \"officeaicopilot-strings\" might be localization files. But why are they being created repeatedly? Each entry is a FileCreate event, and they're all from SDXHelper.exe. If this is part of a legitimate update or installation, maybe there are multiple files being added. But the repetition here is a bit concerning.

That could be normal if they are different versions, but if they are the same file being created multiple times, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother thing to consider: SDXHelper.exe is a known legitimate process, but if it's being used maliciously, it could be dropping files. However, the presence of \"copilot\" in the filenames might be related to legitimate Microsoft features. However, the high number of files created in a short period might indicate something unusual. But since the user hasn't provided timestamps, I can't tell if they're spread out or all clustered.\n\nAlso, the fact that all the files are JavaScript (.js) files.

But given that the process is SDXHelper.exe, which is associated with Office, and the files are related to Copilot, which is a Microsoft feature, it's possible that this is part of a legitimate process. However, the repetition and the number of files might still be suspicious. \n\nBut without more context, like other events (e.g., network activity, registry changes, or other processes), it's hard to be certain. The logs only show file creation events. So, the classification here would depend on whether creating multiple JavaScript files in that directory is normal for SDXHelper.exe.
