{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: SDXHelper.exe is loading combase.dll and urlmon.dll multiple times. Wait, those are legitimate system DLLs, right? But the fact that SDXHelper.exe is loading them repeatedly might not be a problem. However, I should check if there's any unusual activity here.\n\nThen there's taskhostw.exe loading taskschd.dll, which is part of Task Scheduler. That seems normal. Services.exe has a logon event, which is typical. The special logon event with no process might be a red flag, but maybe it's just a system event.\n\nLooking further, SDXHelper.exe is performing multiple DNS queries. That could be normal, but if it's querying a lot of domains or unusual ones, that's suspicious. However, the logs here don't specify the DNS queries, just the rule. So maybe not enough info here yet.\n\nThen there's winlogbeat.exe creating a file in the Downloads directory. That's part of the Winlogbeat setup, which is a legitimate tool for log shipping. So that's probably okay.\n\nThe PowerShell events are interesting. PowerShell.exe is loading several DLLs related to .NET, which is normal for PowerShell. But there's also a file created in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest...mdx.ps1. The name includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest,\" which might be related to testing script execution policies. However, the presence of a temporary script file could be benign if it's part of a legitimate test. But if it's being created without user interaction, that might be suspicious.\n\nWait, the PowerShell process is loading MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, so that's normal. But the other DLLs like mscoree.dll and clr.dll are part of the .NET runtime, so that's expected.\n\nNow, looking at the overall pattern: SDXHelper.exe is loading system DLLs multiple times. If that's the only activity, maybe not. But combined with multiple DNS queries and the temporary script file, it might indicate something. However, I need to check if there's any indication of malicious activity.\n\nAnother point: the process names like SDXHelper.exe aren't standard Windows processes. If that's a third-party application, it's possible, but if it's not known, that could be a concern. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But the fact that it's loading system DLLs repeatedly might be normal if it's a legitimate helper tool.\n\nThe PowerShell script file in the Temp directory could be part of a legitimate test, but if there's no corresponding user action, it might be suspicious. However, the logs don't show the content of the script or the command line arguments, so I can't be sure.\n\nPutting it all together: the most suspicious parts are the repeated DNS queries by SDXHelper.exe and the temporary script file created by PowerShell. However, without more context (like the actual DNS queries or the script content), it's hard to say for sure. But the combination of these events might be worth investigating further. So I'd classify this as \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Repetitive image loading of system DLLs (combase.dll, urlmon.dll) by SDXHelper.exe combined with multiple DNS queries and a temporary PowerShell script creation suggests potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The first event is a file deletion in the Temp directory by PowerShell. That's a common place for temporary files, but deleting a script might be suspicious. Then there are several entries about PowerShell's Provider Lifecycle and Engine Lifecycle. Those are normal parts of PowerShell's operation, so maybe not a big deal.\n\nNext, there's an image loaded event for MpClient.dll and urlmon.dll. MpClient is part of Windows Defender, so that's probably legitimate. Urlmon.dll is part of Internet Explorer, which is also normal. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's HxTsr.exe setting a registry value. HxTsr sounds like a legitimate process, maybe related to hardware or system tools. But I'm not entirely sure. The registry change might be benign, but sometimes malware changes registry settings.\n\nThen, py.exe is launched, which is the Python launcher. That's normal. Then Python processes are created, loading various DLLs. The Python installation path seems legitimate. The image loads for python313.dll and others are part of normal Python execution.\n\nHowever, the initial file deletion of a PowerShell script in the Temp directory could be a red flag. If that script was malicious, deleting it might be an attempt to cover tracks. But the rest of the events don't show any obvious malicious activity. The PowerShell events are common, and the Python processes seem legitimate.\n\nPutting it all together: The only suspicious event is the file deletion. But without more context, like other malicious activities or unusual behavior, it's hard to say. The confidence is moderate. Maybe \"INTERESTING\" because of the deleted script, but not highly confident without more evidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"A PowerShell script (__PSScriptPolicyTest_vw1rvt0c.mdx.ps1) was deleted from the Temp directory, which could indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity. However, the rest of the events show normal PowerShell and Python operations without clear signs of compromise.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.6\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/gemma3_4b\/safe\/safe_20250505_195000.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these events. So, the user wants me to analyze a batch of system logs and determine if they're interesting for investigation. The output needs to be a single JSON with classification, justification, and confidence.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each event one by one. The first two events are about python.exe loading DLLs: _ctypes.pyd and libffi-8.dll. These are part of the Python standard library, so that seems normal. Python often loads these DLLs when running, especially if it's using certain modules. Not suspicious here.\n\nNext, there are two events related to winlogbeat.exe creating a file .winlogbeat.yml.new in the Downloads directory. Winlogbeat is a log shipper, so creating configuration files is part of its setup. However, creating a new config file might be normal during initial setup or updates. But I should note that.\n\nThen there are three events from SDXHelper.exe performing DNS queries. SDXHelper is part of the Sophos Intercept X software. DNS queries are normal for antivirus software to check domains, but if there's a pattern or unusual domains, that could be a red flag. However, the events don't specify the domains queried, so I can't tell yet. Maybe benign, but need to keep an eye on that.\n\nAnother event from RuntimeBroker.exe setting a registry value. RuntimeBroker is part of Windows and handles app permissions. Changing registry values could be normal, but without knowing the specific key or value, it's hard to say. Maybe part of an app update or user action.\n\nNow, looking at the entire batch. The first two events are normal Python operations. The winlogbeat events are about creating a config file, which might be part of installation or configuration changes. The SDXHelper DNS queries could be normal for Sophos, but if there's a high volume or unusual domains, that's a concern. The RuntimeBroker event is neutral without more context.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned to consider the combination of all events. Are there any patterns? The SDXHelper.exe has multiple DNS queries. If that's normal for Sophos, then maybe not. However, if there's a high number of queries or to suspicious domains, it's a problem. But the logs don't provide domain details. The winlogbeat file creation might be normal, but if there's a new configuration that's not user-initiated, that could be an issue. However, the user might have installed it themselves.\n\nThe presence of multiple DNS queries from SDXHelper could indicate that the software is checking for updates or communicating with its servers. That's normal. However, if there's an unusual number or timing, maybe. But again, the logs don't specify.\n\nThe other events don't show any obvious signs of compromise. No unexpected processes, no failed logins, no unusual file accesses. The events are mostly routine operations. So, putting it all together, I don't see any clear signs of malicious activity. The events are either normal operations or part of legitimate software behavior. Therefore, the classification might be \"NOT INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence, since there's no clear evidence of a threat.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events reflect normal system operations: Python DLL loads, Winlogbeat config file creation, Sophos DNS queries, and standard registry updates. No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise detected.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
