Then there's a Process Creation for Registry, but the rest are various tasks like VsmPolicyEnablement, DirtyBootShutdown, BootMenuPolicy, BootType, LeapSecondDataUpdate, and DirtyTransition. Some of these tasks seem related to system boot processes and policies. The presence of \"DirtyBootShutdown\" and \"DirtyTransition\" might indicate some abnormal state during shutdown or boot. However, many of these are standard system tasks. The only process mentioned is Registry and smss.exe, which is a normal system process. There's no clear indication of malicious activity here. The confidence is low because these events are typical during system startup and shutdown. So, I'd classify this as NOT INTERESTING with low confidence.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"NOT INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Events represent standard system boot\/shutdown tasks and normal process creation (e.g., smss.exe).
