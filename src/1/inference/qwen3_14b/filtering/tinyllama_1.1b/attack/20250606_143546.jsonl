So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe, which is a common tool but can be abused for malicious activities. Let me check what's happening with PowerShell here. There are several entries where PowerShell is loading images. The files mentioned include mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, urlmon.dll. Wait, those are legitimate system files, so maybe that's normal. But then there's a file created in the Temp directory: __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1. That filename looks like it could be a script that's been generated, possibly by the user, but maybe it's part of an attack. \n\nAlso, there's a registry value set by PowerShell. That could be a red flag if it's modifying critical registry keys, but the log doesn't specify which keys. However, the presence of registry changes by PowerShell might indicate something's going on.\n\nLooking at other processes: svchost.exe is involved in creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That's part of Windows Update, so that might be normal. But there are multiple file creations there. Also, the user might be concerned about svchost.exe doing unexpected things, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother point is the repeated entries for PowerShell accessing processes and loading images. If this is part of normal operations, like running scripts or updates, it's not a problem. But if there's an unusual number of these events or they're combined with other suspicious activities, that's a concern.\n\nThe file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory could be a temporary script. If that script is executing malicious code, that's bad. But the log only shows the creation, not execution. However, PowerShell being used to create scripts might be part of an attack chain.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. There are some suspicious elements, but they could be legitimate. The presence of the temp script and registry changes by PowerShell are notable. However, without more context like the script's content or other indicators, it's not definitive. I'd lean towards \"interesting\" because there are potential signs of malicious activity, but not enough to be certain. The confidence would be around 0.65, indicating moderate concern.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell.exe instances loading system DLLs (mscoree.dll, urlmon.dll) and creating temporary scripts in user directories, which could indicate malicious activity like script-based attacks or code injection.

First, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: svchost.exe is creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory. That's a normal part of Windows Update, so maybe not a problem. But then there's a file created in the DeliveryOptimization cache. Still seems normal.\n\nWait, then there's a process named 'setup.exe' creating files like cookie_exporter.exe and elevated_tracing_service.exe in the Microsoft EdgeCore directory. Hmm, those names sound a bit odd. Why would setup.exe be creating executables in that location? Maybe part of an installation, but I should check if those files are legitimate.\n\nLooking further, there's a powershell.exe process with a command line that creates a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" and starts it. The binary path is pointing to a file in C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\entrada_base\\bin\\tarefa_logico.exe. That path doesn't look standard. The service name is in Portuguese, which might be a red flag. Also, the command line uses New-Service and Start-Service, which could be part of a malicious payload trying to persist.\n\nAlso, there are multiple registry value set events by svchost.exe. While svchost is a legitimate process, frequent registry changes could indicate something trying to modify system settings. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother point is the Image loaded events for mscoreei.dll and clr.dll. Those are .NET components, so if they're being loaded by PowerShell, it might be part of a script. However, that's not necessarily malicious on its own.\n\nThe key suspicious part here is the PowerShell command creating a new service with a non-standard path. That could be an indicator of compromise. Also, the presence of multiple file creations in unusual directories and the registry changes might be part of a larger attack. However, I should check if these files are known good. But since the user hasn't provided any indicators of compromise, I have to go purely on the logs.\n\nConsidering all this, the creation of a new service via PowerShell with a custom executable path is a strong indicator. Even though some events are normal, the combination of service creation, unusual file paths, and PowerShell usage raises suspicion. So, the classification should be INTERESTING with a confidence around 0.75. The justification is the suspicious service creation and file paths that don't align with standard Windows processes.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious events detected: PowerShell creating a new service with a non-standard path (C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\...\\\\tarefa_logico.exe), unusual file creation in Microsoft EdgeCore directory, and repeated registry modifications by svchost.exe which may indicate persistence mechanisms or unauthorized configuration changes.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this batch of events. The user wants me to determine if the entire batch is interesting for investigation. So, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are multiple entries related to PowerShell.exe. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious activities, so that's a red flag. Let me check the specific events.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: they mention image loaded events for mscorlib.ni.dll, MpOAV.dll, and clrjit.dll. These are .NET framework files and Windows Defender components. Loading these might be normal, but I should check if there's anything unusual. However, the next event is a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script. Then, that same file is deleted. Creating and deleting a script in Temp could be part of a malicious process, like executing a script and then cleaning up.\n\nThen there's a pipe created event, but no file involved. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which might be benign but could also be part of something malicious.\n\nNext, there are entries for tarefa_logico.exe loading various .NET DLLs. The name \"tarefa_logico.exe\" doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows process. Maybe it's a custom application, but the fact that it's loading multiple .NET components might be suspicious, especially if it's not a known legitimate application.\n\nThen there's an event with a command line that imports a module from \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1\". The path has some non-English terms like \"unidade_logico\" (which translates to \"logical unit\" in Portuguese) and \"registro_secundario\" (secondary registry). This could indicate a custom or possibly malicious script. The command line also includes Invoke-entrada_principal, which might be a custom function. The use of $env:Temp suggests temporary storage, which is common in malware to avoid leaving traces.\n\nAnother event shows the creation of a new service named \"objeto_ativo\" (active object) with the binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. Creating a new service without user knowledge is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence. Starting that service immediately after creation is another red flag.\n\nThe repetition of the same command line multiple times might indicate that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly as part of a larger attack or to ensure the service is created and started.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple PowerShell activities, creation and deletion of temporary scripts, loading of suspicious DLLs, creation of a new service with a non-standard executable. These activities are consistent with a malicious process trying to execute code, persist on the system, and cover its tracks. Even though some files are legitimate (like Windows Defender DLLs), the combination of events points towards potential malicious behavior. The presence of non-English paths and custom service names adds to the suspicion. Therefore, this batch is likely interesting for investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell activities involving temporary script creation\/deletion, suspicious module loading, and service creation with non-standard executable paths suggest potential malicious behavior.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.85\n}"}

So, first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's any suspicious activity.\n\nLooking at the first few entries, there's a process using PowerShell to create a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe. Then it starts that service. That seems a bit odd because creating a new service and starting it via PowerShell might be part of an attack, especially if the binary isn't a standard system file. The paths mentioned, like C:\\unidade_logico..., don't look like typical system directories, which could be a red flag.\n\nThen there are multiple entries where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is always the same: componente_auxiliar.ps1. Repeated execution of the same remote command might indicate an attempt to run malicious scripts repeatedly. Also, the fact that the process field is \"None\" for these entries might mean that the command is being executed without a local process, which could be a sign of something like a remote code execution vulnerability being exploited.\n\nThere are also entries with the task \"Engine Lifecycle\" and \"Logon\" related to services.exe. However, services.exe is a legitimate system process, so those might be normal. But the combination with the other events might be significant.\n\nNow, considering the repetition of the same file being executed multiple times. That's a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Also, creating a new service and starting it could be part of persistence mechanisms used by malware. The use of PowerShell for these actions is common in attacks, as it's a powerful tool that can be abused.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any benign explanation. Maybe these are part of a legitimate software installation or update process. But the repeated execution of the same script and the creation of a new service without obvious user interaction (since it's via remote command) lean more towards malicious intent.\n\nThe confidence here would be high because of the combination of creating a new service, repeated remote command executions, and non-standard file paths.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. All three entries are the same: the process is None, the winlog task is 'Execute a Remote Command', and the file path is 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. \n\nFirst, the fact that the process is None might be a red flag. Usually, if a command is executed remotely, there should be a process associated with it. But maybe in some cases, like if it's a service or a scheduled task, the process might not be listed. However, that's a bit unusual.\n\nThe task 'Execute a Remote Command' itself is suspicious. That's a common indicator of compromise, especially if it's happening repeatedly. The same file path is being referenced each time. The file name ends with .ps1, which is a PowerShell script. PowerShell is often used by attackers for executing commands, so having multiple logs pointing to the same script being executed remotely could be a sign of malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, are there any other factors? The user might be running a legitimate script that's being executed remotely. However, the repetition of the same event three times in a row without any variation might indicate something automated, like a script that's being called multiple times, possibly as part of an attack. Also, the path 'unidade_logico' translates to 'logical unit' in Portuguese, which is a bit odd. Maybe that's a red herring, but it's not a standard directory name, which could be a sign of something custom or malicious.\n\nConfidence-wise, the repetition and the nature of the task make me think this is worth investigating. However, without more context, like other logs indicating the same script's content or other processes involved, I can't be 100% sure.
