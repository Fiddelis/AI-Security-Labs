The first two entries show PowerShell commands creating a new service called \"objeto_ativo\" with a binary path pointing to tarefa_logico.exe, then starting that service. That's suspicious because creating a new service and executing an external binary isn't typical in many environments, especially if it's not part of a known legitimate process.\n\nThen there are multiple entries (like 14 of them) where the task is \"Execute a Remote Command\" and the file path is \"componente_auxiliar.ps1\".

The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I'll look at the events.\n\nMost of the entries are about PowerShell.exe performing various actions. There's a Registry value set event, Process Create, Image loaded, Process accessed, File created, and File Delete. Then there are entries for other processes like HxTsr.exe, svchost.exe, and RuntimeBroker.exe, but they seem to be doing similar registry changes.\n\nLooking at the PowerShell events: one of them creates a file in the Temp directory named __PSScriptPolicyTest_xfvkj2f4.w1e.ps1, then deletes it. That's suspicious because creating and deleting a script file in Temp might be part of an attack, like executing a malicious script. Also, there are multiple Image Load events for PowerShell loading various DLLs. Some of these DLLs are from system directories, which might be normal, but others like MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender could be a red flag if they're being loaded in an unusual context.\n\nAnother thing is the use of 'whoami.exe' which is a legitimate command, but combined with the other PowerShell activities, it might be part of a larger malicious process. The svchost.exe entries are creating files in the SoftwareDistribution directory, which is related to Windows Update. Maybe that's part of a legitimate update, but if there's an unusual number of files being created there, it could be a sign of something else.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all these events are normal. For example, PowerShell is commonly used for scripting, and svchost.exe is a normal process. The registry changes by svchost and RuntimeBroker might be part of normal operations. The HxTsr.exe is less common, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's malicious.\n\nBut the key points here are the PowerShell script file being created and then deleted. That's often a sign of an attacker executing a script and then cleaning up. Also, the multiple ImageLoad events for PowerShell loading various DLLs might indicate that it's being used in a way that's not standard. The combination of these events, especially the creation and deletion of the script file, makes me think this is worth investigating further.

The fact that the same file is mentioned twice might indicate an attempt to run malicious code. But wait, the third log is about Windows Update Agent, which is normal. However, the first two entries are suspicious. Since the process is None, that might mean the command is being executed without a clear parent process, which is often seen in attacks.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each event and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve svchost.exe performing registry value sets and file creations. The files are in Windows Update directories like SoftwareDistribution and Logs. That's a bit normal because svchost.exe is a common system process, and Windows Update does create files there. But then there are some other processes: MpSigStub.exe, setup.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, powershell.exe, and whoami.exe.\n\nLooking at the MpSigStub.exe entries, they're creating files in the Windows Temp directory. MpSigStub is related to Windows Defender, so maybe that's legitimate. But the presence of multiple file creations might be worth checking. Then setup.exe is creating files in Program Files for Microsoft EdgeCore. That could be part of an installation, but I need to check if those files are expected.\n\nThe powershell.exe events are loading images, which is normal, but there's also a ProcessAccess event. The whoami.exe process is running, which is a standard command to check user identity. However, the repeated use of powershell.exe and the loading of specific DLLs might be suspicious if they're not part of a known legitimate process.\n\nWait, one of the files created is AM_Delta_Patch_1.429.372.0.exe in the SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install directory. That looks like a Windows Update patch file. If that's a legitimate update, it's okay. But if it's a malicious file masquerading as a patch, that's bad. However, the filename seems to follow the typical naming convention for updates.\n\nAnother thing is the multiple registry value sets by svchost.exe. While svchost is a host process for various system services, excessive registry changes could indicate something malicious. But again, during updates, that's normal.\n\nThe presence of whoami.exe might be part of a script checking user privileges, which isn't necessarily bad. However, combined with other events, it might be part of a larger pattern.\n\nI need to consider if there's any unusual combination. The fact that several files are being created in update directories, along with registry changes, might be part of a legitimate update process. However, the involvement of PowerShell and the loading of specific DLLs could be a red flag. But without more context, like the actual content of the files or the commands executed by PowerShell, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe classification here is tricky. If all these events are part of a legitimate Windows Update or installation, then it's not interesting. However, if some of these files are unexpected or the processes are performing unusual actions, it's interesting. Since the logs don't show any clear signs of malware (like unexpected network activity, unusual processes, or known malicious files), but there are multiple file creations and registry changes, I might lean towards \"INTERESTING\" with moderate confidence. The justification would be the combination of multiple file creations in sensitive directories and the involvement of PowerShell, which could indicate either legitimate activity or a potential security incident.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple file creations in Windows Update directories (e.g., SoftwareDistribution\/Download\/Install) and registry modifications by svchost.exe, combined with PowerShell activity and temporary file creation, suggest potential malicious behavior during an update\/installation process.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143546.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants me to determine if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to scan through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of 'powershell.exe' loading images like 'MpClient.dll' and 'clrjit.dll'. Wait, 'MpClient.dll' is part of Windows Defender, so that's a legitimate file. But why is it being loaded by PowerShell? Maybe normal, but not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a 'Pipe Created' event by PowerShell. Pipes can be used for communication between processes, which isn't inherently bad, but could be part of something malicious if used inappropriately.\n\nNext, 'services.exe' modifying the registry multiple times. Services.exe is a legitimate system process, but changing registry values could be part of persistence mechanisms. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The same event repeats several times, which might indicate some automated process or script.\n\nThen there's 'tarefa_logico.exe' loading 'clrjit.dll' again. That's another .NET component, so maybe part of a legitimate application. But the name 'tarefa_logico.exe' doesn't ring a bell as a standard Windows process. Could be a custom or third-party app, but maybe not.\n\nLooking further, there's a file created in the user's AppData directory under PowerShell's StartupProfileData. That's a common place for legitimate scripts, but could also be used for malicious purposes. However, just creating a file there isn't necessarily bad.\n\nNow, the next entries have a command line that's more concerning. The PowerShell commands import a module from 'C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_secundario\\\\componente_auxiliar.ps1'. The path includes 'unidade_logico' and 'registro_secundario', which look like they might be Portuguese for 'logical unit' and 'secondary register', but that's probably just the file naming. The script is trying to invoke 'Invoke-entrada_principal' with the OutputDirectory set to the Temp folder. Then it sleeps for 5 seconds. The use of 'Invoke-entrada_principal' is a custom function name, which might be part of a legitimate script, but without knowing what it does, it's hard to say.\n\nThen there are multiple instances of 'New-Service' commands creating a service named 'objeto_ativo' (which might be 'active object' in Portuguese) with the binary path pointing to 'tarefa_logico.exe'. Creating a new service is a common persistence technique. The fact that it's done multiple times might indicate that the script is trying to ensure the service is created, even if it fails initially. Also, starting the service immediately after creation could be part of establishing persistence.\n\nThe repetition of the same command lines suggests that the script is being executed multiple times, possibly due to errors or to ensure the service is running. The use of PowerShell for these operations is not unusual, but the combination of creating a service and importing modules from non-standard paths raises flags.\n\nAnother point is the presence of 'tarefa_logico.exe' being used as the binary path for the service. Since this executable was previously loaded by PowerShell, it might be a custom application, but if it's not a known legitimate service, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the registry modifications by 'services.exe' could be related to the new service creation. Maybe the service is being configured to start automatically or have other settings that are not standard.\n\nPutting this all together: the creation of a new service with a custom executable, repeated PowerShell commands importing modules from non-standard paths, and the use of registry modifications might indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system. Even though some components are legitimate (like PowerShell and registry changes), the combination and the non-standard paths and service creation point towards potential malicious activity.\n\nSo the classification would be 'INTERESTING' because there are signs of persistence mechanisms and suspicious file paths. The confidence is around 0.8 because while some elements are normal, the combination of events is indicative of possible malicious behavior.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell events show suspicious activity, including creating a service with a non-standard binary path (tarefa_logico.exe), importing modules from unusual directories (unidade_logico\/registro_secundario), and repeated registry modifications.
