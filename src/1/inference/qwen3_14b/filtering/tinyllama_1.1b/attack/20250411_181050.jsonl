The first one is about winlogbeat creating a file, which might be normal. Then there's a cmd.exe process using certutil to encode and decode calc.exe. That seems suspicious because certutil is often used for encoding, but decoding might be part of an attack. There are multiple registry value set events, which could indicate changes to system settings. The certutil process creating a file in the temp directory is another red flag. The presence of chrome.exe making network connections and accessing the registry might be normal, but combined with the other events, it's concerning. The repeated registry changes and file operations by certutil and cmd suggest possible malicious activity. However, there's not enough evidence of a successful attack or data exfiltration. I'm leaning towards INTERESTING but not certain.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: certutil used for encoding\/decoding files, temporary file creation, and repeated registry modifications.
