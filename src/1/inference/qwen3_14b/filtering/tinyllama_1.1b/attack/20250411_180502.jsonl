Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, there are multiple entries with chrome.exe and registry value set events. That's common, maybe normal behavior. But then there's a process with powershell.exe running a script from a path that looks suspicious: \"C:\\\\estrutura_logico\\\\registro_temporario\\\\..\\\\entrada_comum\\\\componente_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\\" might indicate trying to access a parent directory, which could be a red flag. \n\nNext, there's a process accessed event for powershell.exe and an image loaded event for urlmon.dll. Urlmon.dll is part of Windows, so that's normal. But then there's an image loaded for MpOAV.dll from Windows Defender. That's a legitimate file, but maybe the context matters. \n\nWait, the script path seems odd. The directory structure has \"estrutura_logico\" and \"registro_temporario\", which might be Portuguese for \"logical structure\" and \"temporary record\". The use of \"..\\\\\" could be a way to navigate up the directory tree, possibly trying to access files outside the intended directory. Also, the script name \"componente_padrao_script.bat\" might be a generic name used by malware to blend in. \n\nThe other events involve chrome.exe and registry changes, which might be normal if the user is doing something with Chrome, but combined with the suspicious PowerShell script, this could indicate an attack. The fact that PowerShell is used to execute a batch file from a non-standard path is concerning. \n\nI should check if there are any other indicators. The events don't show any direct network activity or file creation, but the script execution might be part of a larger attack. Since the script's path is not typical and uses relative paths, this could be a sign of malicious activity. \n\nThe confidence here is medium because while some events are normal, the PowerShell command and the path used might indicate an attempt to execute a script in a way that's not standard. However, without more context like network connections or unusual file modifications, it's not definitive. But the presence of the suspicious script execution makes this batch interesting enough for further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Suspicious PowerShell command execution with a script path containing '..\\\\' directory traversal, potentially indicating an attempt to access non-standard or hidden directories. Combined with multiple registry modification events from chrome.exe and powershell.exe, this may suggest anomalous behavior warranting further investigation.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.65\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250411_180502.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me look through these logs. So, the user wants me to determine if this batch of events is interesting for investigation. Alright, first, I need to check for any suspicious activities.\n\nLooking at the processes, there's a lot of PowerShell.exe activity. The command lines show that PowerShell is being used to start various batch files. The paths mentioned are a bit odd. For example, there's a part where the command line has \"..\\\\pacote_secundario\\\\objeto_padrao_script.bat\". The use of \"..\\\\\" might indicate that the script is trying to navigate up directories, which could be a way to access files outside the intended directory. That's a common tactic in some attacks to bypass restrictions or access sensitive areas.\n\nThen, there are multiple entries where PowerShell loads DLLs from Windows directories like mscoreei.dll, clrjit.dll, clr.dll. These are legitimate .NET DLLs, so loading them might be normal. However, the fact that they're being loaded in a PowerShell context might be worth noting. But I don't see anything immediately malicious here.\n\nAnother point is the file deletion event. The file at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_wdxgqpwc.143.ps1 is being deleted. Temporary files are common, but deleting a script after execution could be an attempt to cover tracks. However, without more context, it's hard to say if this is malicious.\n\nThere are also several \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\" events. These might be related to PowerShell's internal operations, but they don't necessarily indicate a problem. The Registry value set events are from Chrome, PowerShell, and Calculator. Calculator setting a registry value seems odd, but maybe it's part of some legitimate action, though I can't think of a scenario where Calculator would modify the registry. However, without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe Chrome.exe entries have DNS queries and network connections. That's normal for a browser. The repeated registry events from Chrome might be part of its normal operation, like updating settings or extensions.\n\nPutting it all together: The main suspicious points are the PowerShell scripts with the \"..\\\\\" in the paths, which might be trying to access parent directories. The deletion of a temporary script file could be an attempt to hide evidence. However, these could also be part of legitimate scripts if the paths are correct. The presence of multiple PowerShell processes and the use of batch files might indicate some automation, but not necessarily malicious. However, the combination of these events does raise some flags that warrant further investigation. So, I'd say this is interesting enough to look into more deeply.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes executing batch scripts with suspicious path traversal (e.g., '..\\\\..\\\\') and temporary file deletion, which may indicate obfuscation or cleanup of malicious activity. Registry modifications by non-system processes also raise concerns.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
