{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me go through these logs step by step. First, I notice that there are multiple events related to PowerShell.exe. The first event is a registry value set, which might be normal, but then there's a process create event with a command line that uses New-PSDrive to map a network drive. That seems suspicious because mapping a network drive (like \\\\Target\\\\C$) could be an attempt to access remote systems or exfiltrate data.\n\nNext, there are several image load events. PowerShell loading .NET DLLs like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, and clrjit.dll. While these are legitimate components, loading them in certain contexts might indicate something's wrong. However, I need to check if there's any unusual pattern here.\n\nThen, there's a file created in the Temp directory with a .ps1 file, which is a PowerShell script. The script is later deleted, which is a common tactic to avoid leaving traces. The creation and deletion of temporary scripts can be a red flag, especially if the script's content isn't known. \n\nAnother event shows a pipe created, which could be used for inter-process communication. While not inherently malicious, combined with other events, it might indicate command and control traffic.\n\nThe whoami.exe executions are normal, but they're repeated. However, the main concern here is the PowerShell activities. The use of New-PSDrive to access a remote share (C$) might be part of a larger attack, like initial access or data exfiltration. The loading of .NET assemblies could be part of a malicious script trying to execute code or bypass restrictions.\n\nPutting it all together: creating a temp script, loading multiple .NET DLLs, accessing a remote drive, and deleting the script afterward. These actions are often seen in attack chains, especially in scenarios where an attacker is trying to execute arbitrary code or maintain persistence. The confidence here is medium because while some actions are suspicious, they could also be part of legitimate administrative tasks.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. The user wants me to determine if the batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to go through each line and see what's happening.\n\nMost of the events involve PowerShell.exe with various tasks like Image loaded, File created, File Delete logged, Pipe Created, and Registry value set. There are a few instances where files are created and then deleted in the Temp directory. For example, the file __PSScriptPolicyTest_gzczo0hj.dry.ps1 is created and then deleted. Similarly, another file __PSScriptPolicyTest_gbsqa1tg.2k0.ps1 is also created and deleted. That might be normal behavior for temporary files, but sometimes attackers use temp files to execute malicious scripts and then delete them to cover tracks.\n\nLooking at the image loaded events, there are references to system files like System.Management.Automation.ni.dll, clrjit.dll, clr.dll, and MpOAV.dll. These are legitimate system files, so loading them isn't necessarily suspicious. However, the repetition of some image loads might indicate something, but not sure yet.\n\nThere's also a whoami.exe process, which is a standard command to get user information. The command line for PowerShell includes & {} which is an empty command, so that might just be a test or a benign operation.\n\nThe Registry value set events could be part of normal operations, but if there's a pattern of changing registry keys, that might be a red flag. However, in the given data, there's no specific registry key mentioned, just the event type.\n\nNow, considering the combination of events: multiple file creations and deletions in the Temp directory, along with various image loads. The fact that the same files are created and then deleted might be suspicious. Attackers often use temp files to execute scripts and then remove them. However, PowerShell is a common tool for both legitimate and malicious activities. The presence of multiple ImageLoad events for system files might not be harmful, but combined with the temp file operations, it could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.\n\nBut wait, there's also the Pipe Created event. Pipes can be used for inter-process communication, which is normal, but if there's an unusual number of pipes or they're used in a suspicious context, that could be a problem. However, the data doesn't show any anomalies in that area.\n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The events aren't definitively malicious, but the pattern of creating and deleting temp files with PowerShell could be a sign of something. However, without more context or other suspicious activities (like network connections, unusual command lines, or access to sensitive files), it's hard to be certain. The presence of the whoami.exe is normal, and the image loads are of legitimate files. So maybe this is just normal PowerShell usage, but the repeated file creation and deletion might be worth looking into.\n\nSo, the classification would be INTERESTING because there's a pattern of temp file creation and deletion, which could be indicative of malicious behavior. However, the confidence isn't extremely high because the same actions could be part of legitimate processes. Maybe around 0.6 or 0.7. Justifying that the combination of events shows possible attempts to execute and clean up scripts in the Temp directory, which is a common tactic in attacks.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes create and delete temporary script files in the user's Temp directory, which could indicate an attempt to execute and obfuscate malicious code.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user provided a bunch of log entries, and I need to determine if they're interesting for investigation. So first, I should look through all the events and see if there's anything suspicious.\n\nLooking at the processes, most of them are powershell.exe, which is common but can be used for malicious activities. There are a few instances of whoami.exe, which is usually benign but might be part of a larger attack. The winlog tasks include things like ProcessAccess, FileCreate, ImageLoad, etc. \n\nOne of the events has a file created at C:\\Users\\fiddelis\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_h1gpo202.5ec.ps1. The name of the file includes \"PSScriptPolicyTest\", which might be related to testing PowerShell execution policies. However, the presence of a script in the Temp directory could be a red flag, especially if it's being created by PowerShell. \n\nAnother event shows a process creating a file in the DeliveryOptimization folder, which is part of Windows. But the file name is keyValueLKG.dat, which doesn't ring a bell as standard. Maybe that's normal, but I'm not sure. \n\nThen there are several ImageLoad events pointing to .NET assemblies like mscoree.dll, mscoreei.dll, clr.dll, etc. These are legitimate system files, so that might not be suspicious. However, loading these could be part of a malicious script using .NET.\n\nLooking at the command line for one of the PowerShell processes: it's checking if a file exists at \"C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe\". The path has some odd elements, like \"unidade_logico\" which might be a Portuguese term for \"logical unit\" or something else. The use of \"..\\\" suggests navigating up a directory, which could be an attempt to access files outside the intended path. Also, procdump.exe is a tool that can be used for dumping processes, which might be used maliciously. The script is checking if this file exists, which could be part of an attack trying to use procdump if it's present.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple PowerShell processes being created and accessed, along with loading various DLLs, might indicate that someone is trying to execute scripts or payloads. The presence of the Temp file and the check for procdump.exe could be signs of an attacker trying to run malicious code or exfiltrate data.\n\nHowever, some of these events might be normal system activities. For example, PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks. But the combination of multiple PowerShell events, the Temp file creation, and the directory traversal in the command line might indicate something more. \n\nThe confidence here is a bit tricky. The events aren't obviously malicious, but the combination of certain elements (like the Temp script and the procdump check) could be suspicious. I'd lean towards \"INTERESTING\" but with moderate confidence, maybe around 0.65. There's enough to warrant further investigation but not conclusive proof of malicious activity.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple PowerShell processes with suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., checking for procdump.exe in non-standard paths) and temporary file creation may indicate potential malicious activity.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's look at these logs. The first thing I notice is that there are multiple entries for svchost.exe related to registry events. Specifically, there are 23 entries where svchost.exe is involved in \"Registry object added or deleted\" events. That's a lot. Normally, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services, but it can also be exploited by malware.\n\nThen, there's a line where cmd.exe is used to run a command that disables the firewall: \"netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off\". Disabling the firewall is a red flag because it leaves the system vulnerable. This command is typically associated with malicious activity, as it's a way to bypass security measures.\n\nAnother entry is powershell.exe being accessed multiple times. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, frequent access without clear justification might indicate someone is trying to execute scripts or commands that could be harmful.\n\nThe combination of these events is concerning. The firewall being disabled could be part of a broader attack, and the registry changes by svchost.exe might be an attempt to modify system settings or install malicious software. However, I need to check if these events are all within a short time frame. If they're spread out, it might be normal system activity. But since the logs don't specify timestamps, I have to assume they're in sequence. \n\nAlso, svchost.exe is a common host for legitimate services, but if it's making a lot of registry changes, that's unusual. It's possible that a malicious process is using svchost.exe to avoid detection. The fact that there are so many registry events could indicate an attempt to persist or alter system configurations.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of the firewall disable command and the numerous suspicious registry modifications by svchost.exe suggest potential malicious activity. However, without more context like timestamps or user context, I can't be 100% certain. But the combination of these events is enough to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious activities detected: (1) 'cmd.exe' executing a command to disable Windows firewall, which is a common attack technique.

{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these logs. The user wants to know if this batch is interesting for investigation. So first, I need to analyze all the events together.\n\nStarting with the first few entries: there are multiple instances of svchost.exe triggering Registry object added or deleted events. svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services. However, repeated registry changes could be suspicious, especially if they're part of a larger pattern. But on their own, they might not be a red flag.\n\nThen I see several PowerShell commands. The first set of PowerShell commands are using New-PSDrive to map a network drive, specifically pointing to \\\\Target\\\\C$. That's a bit odd because typically, you'd map a network share, but here it's using a UNC path. Also, the command is using the -unidade_auxiliar parameter, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe that's a typo or a custom parameter? Not sure, but it's not standard. That could be a sign of something unusual.\n\nNext, there are multiple instances of powershell.exe & {} commands. The empty script block might be a way to execute other commands without triggering alerts, or it could be a placeholder. However, the repetition here might indicate some automated process or testing. But again, not necessarily malicious.\n\nThen there's a command that checks if procdump.exe exists in a specific path. Procdump is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals used for dumping processes, but if it's being checked in a non-standard location, that could be suspicious. The path mentioned is C:\\unidade_logico\\registro_comum..\\registro_secundario\\procdump.exe. The use of ..\\ might be an attempt to traverse directories, but it's still a valid path. However, if the attacker is trying to locate or use procdump.exe in a way that's not typical, that could be part of a larger attack, like dumping memory for analysis or exfiltration.\n\nLooking at the winlog tasks: some are 'Provider Lifecycle' and 'Engine Lifecycle'. These tasks are related to PowerShell's internal operations. While normal, the combination with the command lines might indicate something. For example, the 'Provider Lifecycle' events could be related to the New-PSDrive command, which is part of the PowerShell provider model.\n\nPutting it all together: the repeated registry changes by svchost.exe might be part of a persistence mechanism. The PowerShell commands are trying to map drives and check for the presence of procdump.exe. If procdump.exe is being used, it could be part of a data extraction phase. However, without more context, like actual execution of procdump or network traffic, it's hard to confirm. But the combination of these events—especially the repeated PowerShell commands and the registry changes—might indicate an attempt to establish persistence or prepare for further actions. However, since there's no direct evidence of malicious activity (like downloading files, connecting to C2 servers, etc.), it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut wait, the justification needs to be concise. The key points are the repeated registry changes by svchost.exe and the PowerShell commands that map drives and check for procdump.exe. These could be signs of an attacker trying to set up persistence or prepare tools. However, since svchost.exe is a normal process, maybe it's a false positive. But the PowerShell commands are more suspicious. The confidence here is moderate—maybe around 0.7. It's not a clear-cut attack, but there are enough indicators to warrant further investigation.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple suspicious PowerShell commands mapping network drives and checking for procdump.exe, combined with repeated registry changes by svchost.exe, suggest potential malicious activity related to persistence or data extraction.\",\n  \"CONFIDENCE\": 0.75\n}"}
{"file":"filtering\/tinyllama_1.1b\/attack\/20250606_143841.jsonl","analysis":"<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these events. All three entries are about PowerShell processes running a command that checks if a file named procdump.exe exists in a specific directory. The command uses Test-Path and exits with 0 or 1 based on whether the file is present.\n\nFirst, I know that procdump.exe is a legitimate tool from Sysinternals, often used for dumping processes. However, it's also a tool that can be abused by attackers for malicious purposes, like extracting memory dumps from processes. So the presence of this file might be benign, but the check itself could be part of a larger malicious activity.\n\nLooking at the command_line, the path being checked is \"C:\\\\unidade_logico\\\\registro_comum\\\\..\\\\registro_secundario\\\\procdump.exe\". The use of \"..\" in the path might indicate that the attacker is trying to navigate up a directory, which could be a way to access files in parent directories that might not be directly accessible. This could be a red flag, as it might be part of a path traversal attempt.\n\nNow, the task in winlog is \"Provider Lifecycle\" and \"Engine Lifecycle\". These tasks are related to the lifecycle events of the Windows Event Log system. However, the presence of these logs alongside the PowerShell command might not be directly related to the suspicious activity. But since all three events are the same, it's possible that they are part of a script that's checking for the presence of procdump.exe, perhaps to determine if it's already been dropped, or to check if it's available for use.\n\nThe fact that all three events are identical might suggest a repetitive check, which could be part of a larger process, like a malware's persistence mechanism or a check to see if a tool is available before proceeding with further actions. However, without additional context, such as other events that show the actual use of procdump.exe, or other suspicious activities like network connections, file modifications, or privilege escalation, it's hard to be certain.\n\nThe justification for classification would hinge on whether this activity is typical or suspicious. Since checking for the existence of a file is a common administrative task, but the specific use of procdump.exe and the path traversal might be more concerning. However, since the events don't show any actual malicious activity beyond the check, the confidence level might be moderate. The classification might be \"INTERESTING\" because the combination of checking for procdump.exe and the path traversal could be indicative of a potential threat, even if not confirmed yet.\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"CLASSIFICATION\": \"INTERESTING\",\n  \"JUSTIFICATION\": \"Multiple identical PowerShell commands check for the existence of procdump.exe in a directory path containing '..\\\\', which may indicate path traversal attempts or attempts to access files in parent directories.
